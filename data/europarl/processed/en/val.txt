Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has asked me to make a statement on the events in the Middle East. The debate will take place on Wednesday afternoon in the presence of the Chairman of the Council of Foreign Ministers, Czech Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg. I mention this because it was not quite clear. We have put a lot of effort in and found him very willing to be with us, although he will have to travel to South Africa on the same day, if only for a limited time I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Czech Presidency most sincerely for this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is aware of the situation in Gaza. That we should discuss it here in Parliament is perfectly natural. However, we are calling for the Security Council to take a stand, we are calling for the bodies to take a stand, and for the European Union to take a stand, but we, in Parliament, we debate matters but we do not want to take a stand. I do however believe that, faced with the urgency of the situation in Gaza, it is extremely important for this House to give its opinion and say exactly what it wants, in order to end the massacres currently taking place in the Middle East. I find it unacceptable that this House should not have the courage or the lucidity to vote in favour of a resolution after our debate. That is why our group is calling for the Conference of Presidents' decision to be reviewed and for the debate that we must hold on the Gaza situation to end in a resolution, one that demonstrates the clear and firm position of this House, of a majority, so that the massacres in Gaza stop. We want a resolution; we must be aware that we have a political responsibility faced with the current situation, and this political responsibility must not be a mere debate, but a resolution, a resolution that clearly states what we want and what we denounce!
Mr President, we have, of course, given this matter a great deal of thought. Perhaps Mr Cohn-Bendit overestimates the significance of a resolution, but with the Security Council's resolution we have a basis which we should support and, as the President of Parliament has already said, we should require both sides to seek peace, to lay down their arms and to comply with the Security Council's resolution. I would, however, just like to add that this must be the gist of our resolution. If this is so, we can support it. In this context we would cooperate and in this context we would support Mr Cohn-Bendit's motion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation of the Conference of Presidents is based on great wisdom. We have, today, heard a statement by the President of Parliament who, if I am correct, was supported by all sides of the House. This is an important basic principle and an important statement by Parliament. We will receive a great deal of information over the next few days: through sittings held by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and by delegations and through communications received from the Presidency of the Council and from the Commission. Therefore, we are not in a position to effect a resolution today, which will actually correspond in detail to how things stood on Thursday.
I spent two days last week on the Gaza Strip border and observed a great deal of the suffering of the people on both sides. I believe that a ceasefire alone will not be enough. The ceasefire must be linked to a cessation of weapons smuggling into Gaza in the future. The details of the negotiations taking place in Egypt today, in particular, are of crucial importance. We should not destroy this by a resolution perhaps shaped by emotions. Therefore, I am in favour of the retention of the resolution from the Conference of Presidents.
Four and a half years have passed, and yet the nationals of the new Member States still feel like second-class citizens. What has happened, Mr President, is that a competition was announced last year for the post of head of unit of the Hungarian interpreters working at the European Parliament, a post to which the citizen of any Member State was eligible to apply. The head of unit in the interpretation service is responsible not only for administrative tasks but also for overseeing the transposition of European Union terminology into Hungarian.
However, in a way it is a bit mundane to speak about bread-and-butter issues, having listened to all that has been said, but of course bread-and-butter issues concern all our citizens. Last weekend in Ireland the announcement by Dell, that it was relocating 2 000 jobs, came as a body-blow to the community in the Mid-West and West of Ireland. At a time when we are experiencing a global financial downturn, this is especially difficult for workers directly employed by Dell and for its suppliers etc.
(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, two days ago four schools in the city of Burgas found their walls daubed with racist slogans. They had sprayed on their walls things like: 'Turn Bulgarians into soap' and 'Death to the giaours'. 'Giaour' is a derogatory Turkish expression used during the time of the Ottoman Empire to refer to non-Muslim subjects and those of non-Turkish origin. In the Turkish mind a giaour is considered to be subhuman, which makes it the most offensive racist insult in the Turkish language. 'Giaours' is the same word used by the former minister of agriculture Nihat Kabil and the Turkish administrators in the Ministry of Agriculture to refer to the Bulgarians who had joined the department, following which they gave preferential treatment to the Turks.
Thank you Mr President. I commend the efforts of the Czech presidency to handle the present gas crisis but just mediating one crisis after another is not the solution. The EU cannot remain in a babysitter role; that of an enfant terrible. One conclusion is clear: counting on a mutually beneficial strategic alliance with Russia as a reliable provider of energy is a strategic miscalculation. The root cause of the current crisis is not Ukraine, but the crisis within Gazprom itself, which has failed to live up to its own commitments.
. - (HU) Mr President, fellow Members, the economic crisis that many people initially took to be scare tactics on the part of the media has now reached Europe; it afflicts countries, regions, local communities, enterprises and with them families and workers. Two of our fellow Members have already spoken of this. The consequences of the recession do not affect all of us equally, as the Commission reminds us in its Communication. The negative impact is multiplied exponentially on the fringes of Europe and society.
Three politicians from the Polish minority were elected in the recent Lithuanian parliamentary elections. The Lithuanian authorities subsequently tried to deprive them of their parliamentary seats. The reason given is that these persons hold the Karta Polaka. This is a document confirming that the holder belongs to the wider Polish nation. It is intended to help preserve Polish culture and national identity amongst persons of Polish origin the world over. The Lithuanian authorities, however, consider that it involves loyalty to a foreign country. This is obviously ridiculous and outrageous. In addition, it amounts to discrimination for reasons of ethnic origin, and also involves violating the rights of a national minority, which is behaviour unworthy of a Member State of the European Union. I trust the Lithuanian authorities will reflect on the matter.
- (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Bernd Posselt, who represents the Bavarian CSU party here in Parliament and who also leads the Sudeten German Society has proposed that the Czech Republic abolish the so-called Benes Decrees during the course of its presidency. This is an outrageous demand and one that cannot be fulfilled by the Czech Republic. We surely know that the Decrees came into being after the Second World War in accordance with the views of the victorious powers and they replaced legal standards until a proper parliament was elected. It is therefore not a question of some sort of cancerous growth on European parliamentary order, as he has claimed. In my opinion Mr Posselt's organisation resembles a cancerous growth as it acts in direct opposition to the aims of modern European integration pursued by the EU. While Mr Posselt is attacking the Czech Republic, there are thousands of German citizens living and working there happily and there are large numbers of former Sudeten Germans who have retired there. I am myself an example of the fact that in today's Czech Republic there is no anti-German aggression since I was elected as a German citizen to represent the Czech Republic in this Parliament.
(SL) Last year we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the year before that in this House we adopted a resolution which called upon the Bureau, the Council and the Commission to strengthen their efforts towards more effective multilateralism and more stringent implementation of this treaty, which we know has curbed the proliferation of nuclear arsenals, but, unfortunately, failed to bring about a reduction in their numbers. The resolution also called on the United States of America to withdraw their nuclear warheads from European territory and on the United Kingdom and France to halt their nuclear missile programmes.
As I only entered this esteemed House in November last year, may I ask to what extent and in what way these calls have been answered or, rather, how successful these efforts have been, given the fact that a new project for the deployment of a US anti-missile shield in the Czech Republic and Poland is being revived and that this very project is, as anticipated, generating new tensions between the West and Russia, as well as images and threats of a renewed and dangerous nuclear arms race?
My country has surrendered a part of its identity, but it has done so with pride. Just as we treasured our own currency, we have started using the euro and the majority of the Slovak population is quickly beginning to regard it as its own, too. We adopted the euro after only five years of membership in the EU and as Prime Minister Fico said on New Year's Day, we could see the euro as a lucky talisman bringing us stability and the potential for Slovakia to develop even more vigorously in this time of economic crisis. I would like to praise everyone who contributed to the adoption of the euro in Slovakia and to acknowledge the positive attitude of the Slovak public to the new currency.
However, now to the matter in hand. The Austrian police stopped a truck containing137 puppies. The vehicle manifested serious defects and the animals' passports were forgeries, as the dogs had not reached the legally required age for transport. The journey started in Slovakia and was due to end in Spain. This case is not unique and it brings to our notice once more that profit-orientated organisations are constantly evading current animal protection provisions in Europe in a criminal fashion. In Europe we really need comprehensive inspections of animal transportation and corresponding threats of fines in the event of non-compliance. The EU must jointly adopt European minimum standards in animal protection, which must be implemented and monitored by all governments. This would also compel those countries, which have been completely inactive in the field of animal protection to date, to introduce specific standards.
- (CS) Happy New Year, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my frank amazement over the irony of fate that the Czech government, which is well-known for its specific approach to the question of negotiations with Russia, has not yet torn asunder its veil and heaped ashes upon its head. It has even postponed negotiations with Russia over energy security. I am yet more shocked by the position of the European Commission. It is threatening Slovakia and Bulgaria with sanctions and we have even heard that Mr Cohn-Bendit also recommends sanctions if the decommissioned nuclear power station blocks are brought back into operation. I would like to recommend to the Commissioners and spokesmen of the European Commission that they get some warm clothing, switch off the heating at home and explain to their families that they are acting out of solidarity with the Slovaks and Bulgarians. Or perhaps this was just a bad New Year's joke?
Madam President, I wish to raise the issue of Zimbabwe. It seems to me that if Zimbabwe is not on our television screens, then we do not really concern ourselves with some of the issues that arise there. Recently we had the case of Jestina Mukoko, Executive Director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project and a board member of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, who was abducted and held incommunicado for 21 days before reappearing at Harare Magistrates Court bearing signs, it might be said, of torture and ill treatment - all for the crime of being a human rights campaigner.
Madam President, I welcome the statement by the President this evening on Gaza and, indeed, the decision of Parliament to have a resolution on the issue to urge an immediate, unilateral ceasefire by all sides in the Gaza conflict. With over 900 now dead, the futility of politics-by-war is painfully evident. You must insist that Israel stop the killing. Gaza is the largest prison in the world, with 1.5 million prisoners; it is now also a slaughterhouse, unfortunately, with men, women an children dying simply because they are Palestinian.
What possible crimes could the Palestinian children, who are dying in this conflict, be guilty of? What possible excuses have we Europeans to continue to do business with Israel while it callously continues to slaughter innocent people? The European Council must stop making excuses, stop the bickering and unite in concerted action which will bring this slaughter to an end. There can be no question of upgrading Europe's relations with Israel so long as it fails to engage in constructive dialogue with all the representatives of the Palestinian people.
By so doing, Eutelsat has once again demonstrated that ethical business is a concept quite foreign to those responsible for the management of that company, especially if we bear in mind that the independent Chinese television company NTD TV has been prevented from broadcasting for months. Despite appeals from many quarters, the Eutelsat management remains unwilling to revoke its decision, which was in any case taken under pressure from the Chinese Government. The surprising and totally amoral choices made by the management of Eutelsat raise concerns as to whether the intentions of those in charge are purely business-orientated.
We have to demand an end to the attack on Gaza. We have to demand an end to Israel's blockade, which is turning Gaza into a concentration camp. That is why we join all those people from every country and every continent who demonstrate against the massacres: all those people from every country and every continent who are angry and go out to the streets and say 'No more crimes!' It is crucial for the European Parliament and other responsible European Union bodies to demand an immediate end to the attack on Gaza and an immediate end to Israel's blockade.
- (CS) Thank you, Madam President. I have recently been struck by the way that several Czech insurance companies have discontinued the provision of bonuses paid to women who take out compulsory car insurance policies. This step was justified with reference to the new anti-discrimination law coming into force. We see again and again how some politicians and non-governmental organisations adopt a rather exaggerated position over the question of gender equality. One such exaggeration constitutes a denial of actuarial mathematics which proves day in and day out that men and women behave differently in various aspects of their lives and therefore carry different levels of insurance and other risks. To deny such differences is not to fight for equal rights but rather to fight for the conformity and sameness of both sexes. Such a fight would be both futile and ridiculous. Men and women vary from each other precisely because the two sexes complement each other in a useful and beneficial way in everyday life, in partnerships and in society.
Madam President, a new opinion poll commissioned by the Campaign for an Independent Britain has just been published. Most of those surveyed said that the European Union is out of touch, corrupt and is poor value for money; 83% of those polled want UK law to be paramount and, therefore, to revoke the supremacy of EU law; and 71% want a referendum on continued British membership. Unfortunately, there is not much chance of that, given that the Labour Government will not even give them a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, which it promised in its election manifesto.
What is more important now is for us to decide what measures to take to overcome the crisis. In this case, this may mean that Bulgaria has to find an alternative so that it can break its external dependence. This is why I believe that it is essential for Europe and Balkan countries, like Bulgaria, to follow the example of Slovakia and make the decision to restart blocks I, II, III and IV at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. At the moment, this is the only option Bulgaria has, enabling it to gain a modicum of independence and reduce both the direct damage and the damage that will be caused by using fuel oil at the moment as a substitute for gas.
I equally believe that, in spite of the current climate, 2009 should be the year when our actions as well as the European Commission's actions should be targeted at a single Europe for all Europeans. A Europe in which each of its 500 million citizens feels that their rights are guaranteed, that there is a real sense of solidarity, that no one can ever be discriminated against again, that no one needs to ever feel like an outsider or tolerated in a united Europe, that we are all European citizens who feel the same way, no matter where each of us was before 1989.
Recycling paper has been much in the news recently. The current situation in Poland in this regard may be summarised as follows. Those engaged in collecting scrap paper maintain that the prices are too low and that it does not pay to handle it. On the other hand, those who produce paper using recycled paper claim that the latter is too expensive for them and that the current prices mean it is not worth their while investing in equipment for processing it. I therefore appeal for environmentally conscious action to resolve this problem. As things stand at present, children are collecting scrap paper because the activity has educational value, but the paper is then being dumped on communal tips.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, which you, Mrs Vassiliou, are a part of, has announced the publication of its Action Plan on Urban Mobility several times. The plan was due to be submitted to the Council and Parliament last autumn. The Commission made this commitment at the conclusion, last March, of the consultation on the Green Paper on Urban Mobility, which was launched in 2007, and again in the 2007 Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan, and in its Communication on a strategy for the internalisation of external costs and transport in 2008.
Time has passed, but the action plan is yet to see the light of day. As we near the end of the current legislative term, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I represent, is concerned that much of the work put in over the last few years may come to nothing. Can you reassure me, Commissioner, that the action plan is ready? Can you tell me that it will be made public in the next few weeks, to enable Parliament to finalise its recommendations, as contained in the Rack resolution 'Towards a new culture for urban mobility', passed by this House in July 2008?
The Commission's - and therefore the EU's - evasion of this subject does nothing to help solve the problem of urban transport and citizens' mobility, nor the problems of air pollution in cities - we know that 40% of CO2 emissions are caused by urban transport and that 70% of other transport pollutants are urban. Nor does it help the problems of road safety - we know that 50% of fatal accidents take place in cities - nor those relating to the production of consumers, less able citizens, whose mobility is dependent on public transport.
If the Union takes it on, will this not help in realising those subsidiary solutions that Member States and local communities have every right to be protective of? Mrs Vassiliou, it may be that you are about to give us a list of good reasons for the delay, and even the failure to present the Action Plan on Urban Mobility. If you want to try and defend the failure to keep this commitment, before you do so, ask yourself - are these genuine reasons and not banal excuses? Do not contribute, Mrs Vassiliou, to the idea - which has become popular recently - that the Commission has become so afraid of disturbing the Member States that it has given up on solving Europeans' problems. It would be a suicidal move for an institution such as the Commission that has not been strengthened by the French Presidency's successful term.
As a matter of fact, although cities are all different, they face common challenges. The problems in urban mobility are significant and growing and affect many citizens and businesses, which are confronted with traffic safety problems, with limited accessibility of public transport, with congestion and health problems caused by pollution. To illustrate the importance of urban mobility, let me provide you with some figures: 60% of the population lives in urban areas and 85% of the EU GDP is created there. However, cities also generate 40% of CO2 emissions, and two out of three road accidents take place in urban areas. Finally, congestion, which is one of the main problems that citizens have to face everyday, is responsible for the loss of about 1% of the EU's GDP every year.
But my colleague Vice-President Tajani would like to reassure you that he remains committed to working towards the adoption of the Action Plan and to develop an EU policy in the field of urban transport in full respect of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles. To this purpose, it is not the intention of the Commission to propose a one-size-fits-all solution; on the contrary, we would like to develop a toolbox, including short- and medium-term practical actions, in order to provide cities with the tools to address, in an integrated way, specific issues related to urban mobility. Then, it will be up to local authorities to decide what is more suitable for them, according to their own objectives and needs.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, with all due respect to the Commission and to you as a person, you have not really answered Committee Chairman Costa's question. You had already given us a good intimation when you indicated - and this is something that was already evident in the Green Paper on Mobility in the City - that we need common European solutions to a problem that almost all European cities have in one form or another, some quite different and some quite similar. We welcomed that at the time, a few months ago, and we have looked forward eagerly to the proposals from the Commission that we were promised. They have not materialised, And if there was an intimation in your statement, then I have noted it now as follows: there will be no comprehensive action plan. Why not?
If we believe what we hear - and we hear a great deal in this House and in the institutions of this European Union - it means that there is one Member State or perhaps a few Member States who have caused anxiety, and unfortunately, also caused anxiety to this Commission, with the pretext that subsidiarity could be infringed. The European Parliament has stated expressly in its proposals that it does not wish to interfere with subsidiarity. You have emphasised once more that you do not wish to present a uniform plan to suit everyone, but presenting no plan at all is not a solution. Let us take this step, keep this promise! The re-election of the Commission will not be guaranteed by doing nothing and by one or more Member States not being insulted, but re-election will be guaranteed if something positive is submitted and presented.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, you have just supported us in the initiative that we, the European Parliament, plan to take on this issue. You have just told us that, for obvious reasons, that is, because of the importance of urban transport in the transport field, and because of the objectives of the European climate-change plan, the European Union cannot fail to take an interest in urban transport. Mr Barrault, before you, took the initiative of introducing a Green Paper, with the promise of an action plan. You cannot today deny us this action plan and explain to us that you are implementing it on the quiet, without Parliament's deliberations, without Parliament's control, without any visibility.
It is for this reason that I managed to get my fellow Members - and I must thank them, especially Mr Rack, who did a huge amount of the groundwork - to agree to the European Parliament's doing something completely out of the ordinary and producing the action plan that you do not want to produce, in an own-initiative report, before the elections. This entirely heterodex initiative will carry considerable political weight, since it will involve questions being put to the new European Commissioner for Transport, who will be heard by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and it will therefore carry a great deal of weight in terms of his approval by the European Parliament. I find it regrettable in fact that, today, the European Commission should give in to any old objection from any old Member State.
- (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly a great pity that there has been a delay in the publication of this document and the action plan. Let us not forget that 70% of people in Europe currently live in cities and it must be our aim to secure as soon as possible urban transport which offers greater levels of accessibility, safety and especially reliability while also taking far greater account of the environment. I therefore expect that the published document will not only include new trends but will also evaluate new approaches and measures such as support for healthy forms of transport, for example cycling and walking. Individual communities would then be able to select from this list the most achievable and appropriate options for themselves. In my opinion this is the basic approach. We should ensure support for it, which must of course come from the structural funds in such a way that the resources will serve the desired objective.
In this connection, I should also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in the course of this debate, the question also arose as to whether this Green Paper will lead to action that will somehow assist the cities, or whether it will lead to action that will bind the cities to take certain action. We agreed that these actions should be supportive, in other words, that they should involve assistance. The question that now arises in view of the delay is as follows. What was the European Commission aiming at by presenting the Green Paper? What was its long term plan? Did it really wish to engage in dynamic action, or was it merely interested in sounding out opinion on this matter?
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse what has already been said by my fellow MEPs. I am very disappointed with your response. You stated that the Commission will, of course, come up with a number of proposals concerning urban mobility. Whilst this is self-evident, if you ask me, it is not what we have asked for. What we want is a cohesive vision, an action plan detailing measures and proposals which the Commission will be launching in the next few years so that we can discuss these, not just among ourselves, but also with the public and with any stakeholders and affected parties.
As our fellow Members have said many times before, urban mobility is something that affects everyone in Europe. In all our cities, we face problems of mobility. At European level, the Union can play a very positive role to resolve this issue and related problems; as an investor in new technologies, as a body that lays down and disseminates new technological standards, as the authority that is, indeed, best placed to spread new ideas and good practices, that can promote the fleshing out of mobility plans, that can launch new funding mechanisms, and suchlike.
In the 2007 Green Paper, the Commission points to the legitimacy of the debate concerning the need for it to be involved in the issue of increasing mobility in cities within the Union, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity. Pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity the Union acts in the framework of its competences only when its action is essential and brings added value to the actions of Member States. The aim of the principle of subsidiarity is ensuring that decisions are taken as close to the citizen as possible. This is achieved by constantly checking that action to be taken at Community level is justified in relation to the possibilities that exist at national, regional or local level. The role of the Member States regarding the legitimacy of also involving the European Union's institutions at local level is further strengthened in the Treaty of Lisbon, currently at the ratification stage.
In the package under debate concerning possible action aimed at increasing the level of mobility in urban conurbations, innovative technologies tend to be dealt with separately from intelligent transport systems. The synergies between these two areas should be exploited to draw them together in order to increase flow along streets and make travel more comfortable. Other benefits would be better travelling conditions, shorter journey times, energy saving, fewer emissions, less expenditure on managing the vehicle fleet and on the maintenance and renewal of the surface. Road safety would also be improved.
Madam President, the Commission proposal reviewing the rules for public broadcasting is unacceptable as it currently stands. Public broadcasters play a crucial role in the protection of cultural diversity, linguistic diversity and media pluralism. I am vehemently opposed to the Commission's plans. First of all, we need to realise that public broadcasting corporations are a national preserve and that, consequently, it is the national authorities, and not the European Commission, that should stipulate their policy. This is also clearly enshrined in the protocol on public broadcasting in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Member States organise and finance the public broadcasters as they see fit. Commissioner Kroes's plans seriously undermine the principle of subsidiary and the Member States' freedom of movement and replace them with European interference. I am very surprised that, as a Liberal Commissioner, she should opt for this route.
Secondly, I am apprehensive about the proposal to introduce a prior market test conducted by an independent supervisor. This would give commercial channels considerable input. Is that what we want? A market test will inevitably increase the level of paperwork. It is very much the question whether the smaller broadcasting corporations will be able to afford extra manpower, and who will absorb the extra costs involved? Should the broadcasting corporations foot the bill? Or the taxpayer, perhaps? This initiative is not workable in small Member States. Moreover, this test is very detailed; the proposal is lacking in flexibility. As a consequence, Member States will no longer be able to adopt policy and procedures that tie in with their national systems. Moreover, it is very much the question whether a prior assessment of the market impact and a public evaluation of the new services will not give commercial competitors too much of a head start.
Having got my concerns off my chest, I should now like to provide a brief outline of what happened at the PPE-DE Group's hearing last Thursday, where the Commission's attitude was very positive. The Commission admitted that the proposals were probably excessively detailed and that the wording needed editing. The Director-General informed me that it is possible to delay the final communication until after 5 March, the day on which the Culture, Media and Sport Committee will be organising a second hearing on this subject. After the hearing, the Director-General said that the Commission might have to draft a fresh version based on this new information, before it submits its final communication. This was an excellent result.
This dialogue between the Commission and Parliament is important. We stand ready to listen and to reply to your questions. We also know that Parliament agreed in September 2008 that state aid to public broadcasters should be delivered so that they fulfil their function in a dynamic environment, avoiding the use of public funding for reasons of political or economic expediency. This concurs with our views; both public and private broadcasting are important. The dual system of broadcasting is an answer to Europe's media landscape which must be safeguarded on all platforms.
The draft broadcasting communication therefore seeks to consolidate the Commission's state aid case practised since their existing 2001 communication. The draft ensures that our rules reflect the rapidly changing new media environment. The objective of modernising the communication is to increase transparency and legal certainty. The draft communication clarifies that public broadcasters shall provide audiovisual services on all media platforms while leaving private operators sufficient incentives to stay in the market. This is ensured by the so-called Amsterdam test, which balances the value and the negative effects of publicly financed media services at the national level.
The Amsterdam test will ensure that new media services of public broadcasters satisfy the social, democratic and cultural needs of viewers and listeners while limiting the collateral damage for state aid for private operators to a minimum. We cannot agree that the Amsterdam test would involve an unjustifiable administrative burden. Of course, any test involves work but the minimum effort we require is reasonable and necessary. Firstly, the test is only foreseen for important and truly new services; and here our draft leaves a large margin of appreciation to Member States. Each Member State can decide when a new audiovisual service actually merits being tested. Secondly, the draft exempts pilot projects from the test. Public broadcasters can therefore continue experimenting with new media without any preliminary tests. Thirdly, the draft leaves Member States full freedom to choose their adequate procedures and institutions which apply the test. It is finally worth mentioning that smaller Member States, such as Belgium and Ireland, already implement such tests. The solutions found in these countries are proportionate to the resources available. As the test is quite broad there is also no possibility of infringing on editorial freedom. The test merely requires that a public media service satisfies the social, democratic and cultural needs of society and that its impact on the market is commensurate. To safeguard editorial independence we also open the possibility in the draft that, under certain conditions, the test is done by a public broadcaster itself.
What the Commission has now presented, though, is diametrically opposed to this for various reasons, as Mr Visser has already made quite clear. I should like to start by making a brief comment, Commissioner, in relation to what you said a moment ago. This market test that you propose is already being applied in Belgium, among other countries. Well, to some extent, this is true, but not entirely. This market test, or impact analysis, is indeed already being applied to some extent, by the broadcasters themselves, among others, but not according to the modalities as these have been set out in the Commission proposal, which look somewhat different.
I should like to share our reservations with you regarding the proposal. My main objection is that it clashes with the Lisbon Strategy. Indeed, it is the case today that in many Member States, it is precisely the public broadcasting corporations that bring about and encourage innovation in the media. This should, obviously, stay this way. We are, to my mind, moving in the wrong direction with the patronising administrative attitude that holds back innovation. New platforms, particularly in the digital context, on broadband, on the Internet, and suchlike cost a great deal to develop. Investments of this kind are ideally spread as widely as possible and developed in concert. Private and public broadcasting corporations can then offer content on a shared platform, and it is in terms of content that competition should come in, so that the customer can derive maximum benefit.
Do not get us wrong, though. We are 100% behind balanced competitive relations between the public and private broadcasters. There should be room for both to be able to provide quality content. It is obvious, in this connection, that the public broadcasting corporations should account for the government funds they spend and with which they work, even though we are convinced that there are better ways of doing this. In this connection, we would refer to the British example of the BBC, where alliances have been proposed between different partners in terms of development, production and distribution. This is a good example, to my mind, and I would kindly invite the Commission to start thinking with us along those lines.
Why? Because it is not only our television model that is at stake here; a great deal more is at risk because television broadcasters are not - as we all know, and as we were well aware in our debate on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive - the same as they used to be; what they do, in fact, is process content that they supply via a linear or non-linear platform, and everything interacts perfectly in both areas. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to talk about public service broadcasting as if this debate were being held in the 1970s or 1980s.
On the other hand, it is clear that this debate must take place, since not everything that is labelled a public service today is actually a public service, and it does not always make sense to use public money to do what certain television companies are doing with public money. At the same time, however - and this is the core of our concern, I believe, and I understand it is also that of some of my fellow Members - public television broadcasters are absolutely vital in protecting our cultural and linguistic diversity and ultimately in binding our societies together because, in theory, they are looking for something more than direct profit.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Barroso Commission had announced the abolition of European over-regulation as one of its major political goals. We get the impression with the proposals you are making now that you are actually encouraging over-regulation. The hearing held by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats last week made it clear that there are grave doubts regarding how much you are now interfering in the competences of the Member States. What is now on the table has the stink of over-regulation, and that is not something that we can approve of.
Alongside this, in recent decades, public broadcasting has been encouraged to earn its own money. This is achieved not only through advertising time but also by making much of the information material collected by the broadcasting house available in the form of audio and video material. It is expected that, as a result, viewers and listeners will feel more closely associated, new target groups will be reached and government costs will be limited. This task, which has grown over the years, poses no problems as long as commercial channels do not feel adversely affected.
More effective control mechanisms also need to be adopted in the new mass media environment. Furthermore, given that public broadcasts play a decisive role in cultural and linguistic diversity, all these media, as well as the public corporations and public television, are obliged to provide quality programmes and, at the same time, within the framework of competition with other similar bodies, they must be able to respond positively to the challenges of the times by broadcasting events of global interest, such as the Olympic Games, the World Cup and so on. Unfortunately nowadays this is something that tends to be prevented simply by reason of the fact that, as private companies have more money, public television cannot afford them. Consequently, citizens will not be able to watch these events alongside other programmes.
As some people have said, public broadcasting is often the leading actor in innovation in services, but it is clear that this is an impact which is cross-border and across media sectors. Therefore, it is important to have consistency between the broadcasting communication and the general framework of services of general economic interest. This is an important issue which we have dealt with in Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In particular, the PSE Group Members on this committee have stressed that it is important to create more legal security for services of general economic interest, and we would like to see a framework directive and sector legislation on this decided at a political level.
(NL) Mr President, public broadcasting stands for pluralism, diversity, cultural diversity in Europe, the heart of democracy - I did not make this up, the Commission can confirm this - and public broadcasters are of national importance. There are now plans afoot to introduce a market test that is to be conducted beforehand, particularly for new media activities. I do not think this is a good idea, because Brussels should not dictate beforehand how Member States should organise their public services. How the public interest is served should, in my view, be assessed at national level and no compulsory market test is necessary for that purpose.
Moreover, as for supply, I think that we should not draw a distinction between old and new services because, in practice, the lines between the two are blurred. It is not a case of either/or; television programmes often go hand in hand with new services and vice versa. So, just as in Europe, the two are intertwined. It is not just about the market, but also about the public importance of our public broadcasters, which is universally acknowledged, not least by the Commission. I should like to hear from the Commission whether this will be included in the adapted version of the communication and whether the responsibilities will be assigned appropriately, namely to the Member States, even though these will be accompanied by rules for services of general interest that should be drawn up in consultation with the European Parliament and the Council.
(DE) Mr President, public broadcasting is more than an economic factor. I was at the hearing held by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats last week in Brussels. The importance of information and of the diversity of European culture and education was noted. If 22 Member States are against revision or intensification because we have different framework conditions and different markets, then it is quite wrong to want an extensive administration, a time-consuming test procedure such as this obligatory ex-ante test, or European interference with an unwieldy bureaucratic concept.
- (CS) Mr President, the state agrees with my fellow MEPs that state support for public interest broadcasting requires legislative clarification. We have been calling for this in the European Parliament for a long time. However, I would still like to draw your attention to further urgent matters that the Commission must resolve as quickly as possible. Out of the many problems I will mention three. Firstly, there is a need for the general introduction of shared television aerials to include digital broadcasting, particularly on blocks of flats owned by housing cooperatives, in accordance with the exceptions under Article 5 of the information guidelines, as this is a problem for millions of citizens in the new Member States, including the Czech Republic. The second point is support for greater cooperation between the national councils for radio and television broadcasting and the European institutions in order to achieve better application of public service provisions. The third point is to improve coordination between national monitoring authorities for television broadcasting in respect of fines for inappropriate broadcasts that threaten the moral development of children and young people.
The Amsterdam test allows Member States to provide funding for new media services by public broadcasters. It protects the ability to keep up with changes in our fast-moving media environment. At the same time, it is also in the public interest to maintain the incentives for private operators. Innovation by both public and private broadcasters is important for realising the Lisbon objectives, and it goes without saying that public broadcasters will also remain free to launch any kind of new service on a commercial basis in the future without prior assessment.
You may well ask why I hold the accession prospects of those countries so dear. First of all, I am wholly convinced that the Union has a debt of honour to repay. This reminds me of the debate on Srebrenica which will hopefully be held in this House on Wednesday evening this week. Moreover, that region is of major strategic significance for Europe. The specific proposals in my report are as follows. I argue in favour of further consolidation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). This is an important tool to enhance regional integration in that area, which is, in turn, important preparation if those countries want to integrate in the European market and join the Union in three stages. The European Union should mobilise pre-accession funds through aid across a wide front so as to promote the reform process in those countries. The Member States can also play an important role in this by providing specific training to local public servants. This will grant those countries more official capacity to formulate their own ambitious projects that are eligible for EU funding.
Mr President, when I first started work on this report, the first thing I did was pay a visit to my country's Economic Affairs Department in the Hague, where I was pleased to hear that the Dutch Government had taken on board a government-to-government approach. This is something I described in my report as an example that is worth following, not because it is a Dutch approach, but because it is tailored to, and meets the calls from, the western Balkan states themselves to support the accession process actively and appropriately.
I should like to mention one specific item from my report, namely energy cooperation with the western Balkans, which is, I believe, a highly topical subject. On account of its strategic location, that region could well play a significant role in the transit of crude oil and natural gas. The Union should endeavour to adopt an external energy policy. I am also member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. A number of years ago, we adopted a solid report with a view to adopting a European external policy in the area of energy. Well, just look at the present situation, reinforcing, as it does, this appeal from the European Parliament to the Commission and Council. Surely Brussels should not leave its own Member States out in the cold, literally or otherwise.
I should like to finish off by saying that, as an ex-journalist, I have travelled to the Balkans many times. As a result, I feel much empathy and involvement with that region. In connection with writing my report, I used my travel budget for study trips; together with the Committee on International Trade, and its staff member Roberto Bendini, in particular, together with my own member of staff Dick Jan Diepenbroek, I have undertaken valuable trips to Serbia and Kosovo, and next week, I am hoping to travel to Albania. In short, I may be concluding this report this evening, but the work is not done by a long shot, not for me and not for the European institutions. If we really want to bring that region closer to Brussels and actually demonstrate this by our level of dedication and active support, we have every right to demand that the reform process, the accession, be met with commitment, and this should also be evident. It was a real joy for me to work on this report, and I hope that it will be followed up in separate reports for the individual western Balkan countries.
The Western Balkans, as a region, is a key and valuable partner for the EU. The last Commission communication on the Western Balkans in March 2008 reiterates the EU's strong commitment to the European perspective of the region and confirms, among other things, the importance of the Central European Free Trade Agreement for the economic development of the region. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that the perspective of EU membership can act as a catalyst for sustainable economic development and for securing peace and stability within the region. The Commission also agrees that the individual fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria is of the utmost importance when judging the readiness of countries in the region to join the EU. The EU is the Western Balkans' main trading partner. Deeper economic ties between the EU and the region are therefore vital for boosting the region's economic growth.
Secondly, at the regional level, the European Commission acted as a facilitator in the negotiations on the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and decided to provide financial support and technical assistance to the CEFTA Secretariat and to the parties to help implement the agreement. At the same time, the European Commission values highly the regional ownership of the agreement and acknowledges that CEFTA is fundamental for deeper regional economic integration and for preparing the ground for the eventual full participation of the Western Balkans in the EU single market. Moreover, CEFTA created all the necessary structures to discuss trade-related issues at the regional and bilateral level. This is essential for facilitating and deepening regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations. The European Commission will continue to monitor implementation of the CEFTA and will continue to report on this in its yearly report on the accession and pre-accession process.
Thirdly, at the multilateral level the Commission has supported the accession of the countries in the region to the World Trade Organisation as this is an absolutely fundamental step for effective participation in the globalised economy. The EU has mobilised all available policy instruments to support the countries of the Western Balkans in their endeavours for reforms and regional cooperation. The instrument for pre-accession assistance is important for addressing the region's long term development needs. The total funding for the current financial framework for 2007-2013 is EUR 11.5 billion. Last but not least, the European Commission has started dialogues with all the countries concerned in the region to establish roadmaps for lifting the visa regime.
3. At the same time, we need to give strong backing to compliance with European standards concerning the rights of persons belonging to national minorities in the Western Balkan states, including the rights of the Romanian-speaking communities in Valea Timocului, Vojvodina, Istria and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. These rights must be respected, excluding any trends towards territorial autonomy on ethnic grounds and aspirations to collective ethnic rights, which have already demonstrated their potential for conflict and for triggering bloody wars.
rapporteur. - Mr President, when I initiated this report the issue of global food security was very high on the political agenda and, to some extent, it has slipped from the highlights. But it is certainly an issue that is of concern because there are still upwards of one billion people globally who suffer hunger or malnutrition. Thirty thousand children die of hunger and poverty-related illnesses a day. These are horrific statistics and it makes the issue of how we produce sufficient food and give people access to that food a key issue.
In four minutes it is impossible to do justice to what is in the report, but let me just highlight some of the issues which I believe are of importance. Firstly, the fact that I have put the common agricultural policy and global food security in the one heading suggests that the old practice of bashing the common agricultural policy and blaming it for all the ills of the developing world has moved on, and that we are now aware that the common agricultural policy has provided food security for European citizens, and that as a model it can provide lessons for what we need to do in the developing world in terms of food production.
The Commission shares the broad analysis on the causes of the food crisis which hit many developing countries in the first part of 2008. The Commission will continue to analyse the link between food prices and energy prices. The causality issue is a highly complex one as it involves the interplay of a number of demand and supply factors. Energy prices constitute only one of these factors but one which has both a direct and indirect impact. The topic of biofuels was discussed in detail during the various EP sessions. There is a clear difference between EU and US policy on the extent to which cereal production is being diverted to biofuels. EU biofuels policy does not reduce the availability of food, as the quantities of feedstocks used are very small on a global scale.
I believe that the CAP, with its excesses and imperfections ironed out, could become an example of effective, fair and responsible policy, rising to the food challenge and uniting at the same time the economy, society and the environment. It should also help developing countries by sharing European techniques, knowledge and experience. However, Europe should first and foremost work on reforming international trade rules so that they do not oppose the right of countries to support their agriculture in order to guarantee their food security.
in writing. - (FR) This report on the CAP and global food security provided us with a fantastic opportunity to reflect on how we can ensure that European agriculture plays a full part in achieving the planet's food balance. Indeed, although food needs to continue to increase in the world, the proportion of development aid devoted to agriculture has, for its part, been on a constant decline since the 1980s. That is why I tabled a number of amendments within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that are aimed at making this report more ambitious and, in particular, at proposing that the European Commission adopt a comprehensive strategy on food security issues, thus making the Union's Community policies as a whole more consistent.
While I am delighted that this text emphasises the CAP's crucial role in achieving the objective of food security, I regret that the rapporteur is in favour of aligning agricultural policy more with the market and that she accuses environmental protection initiatives of being responsible for a reduction in agricultural production within Europe. This statement is in my view completely misguided, and, on the contrary, I feel it is necessary to take hold of the climate-change problem in order to develop new models that are designed to produce more and better.
The global food crisis, caused by the constant rise in the price of maize, wheat and energy, the growth in the world's population and climate change have sparked a series of riots and unrest which, if they are not resolved in the near future, could destabilise countries and regions around the globe. What is alarming is the gap between the rate of population growth, which could reach more than nine billion inhabitants by 2050, and the reduction in global food stocks. This kind of situation will most probably lead to conflicts over oil being superseded by conflicts over drinking water and food or by a fight for survival. At the present moment, the European Union is the main donor of humanitarian aid, but the food stocks are starting to become depleted and developing countries, especially in Africa, need more support to help them fight poverty and chronic hunger. Reducing agriculture's dependency on fossil energy sources, using organic products, maintaining fertile soils and adapting the common agricultural policy to the food crisis situation are some of the key elements which need to be taken into consideration in order to break this deadlock.
in writing. - (HU) The most important question facing the European agricultural sector in 2009 is how the global economic crisis will affect the conditions for the production and consumption of agricultural products. The question will be a central topic of the Second Hungarian Agrarian Academy which I am organising jointly with State Secretary Zoltán Gőgös of the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on 17 April 2009 in the town of Pápa. Since 2006, the price of corn has risen threefold, and the price of wheat by 180% on the international market, while overall food prices have increased by 83%. By 2050 the population of the world will have grown to 9 billion, and in order to provide for their needs we will need to double the level of agricultural production; the days of cheap food have thus come to an end. Therefore it is extremely important to preserve, and where possible increase the agricultural capacity of the European Union. It is unacceptable that as a result of the sectoral reforms of the CAP, agricultural production should have decreased in the European Union. Good examples of this are the sugar reform, which has led to the disappearance of the Hungarian sugar industry, and the subsidies given for the grubbing up of grape vines in the context of the wine reform policy. The separation of direct agricultural funding from production is likewise heading in this direction.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, exactly one year ago we took the decision to combine the reports on public finances for 2007 and 2008. There were at least two reasons for this: to try to speed up the process and to take account of the signs of change taking place. We did not know the full extent of the changes at the time, but it was already obvious that by analysing two years together we would gain a more comprehensive and accurate assessment. And we were right! The report we will be voting on tomorrow has been constantly updated.
The report involves at least two levels: that which is general, stable and valid in all situations, and that which is an emergency response to the current crisis. The principle remains intact, even strengthened, that high-quality, sustainable public finances are indispensable not only for individual countries but also for the solidity of the economy and the European social model. As regards revenue, steps must be taken to broaden the tax base, without however weakening the principle of progressive taxation, and to reduce the tax pressure on work, above all for mid to low-level salaries and pensions. As for expenditure, action must involve an assessment of the context, requirements, the composition of the population, with due consideration for gender policies and demographic change. Rather than introducing indiscriminate reductions, the aim should be to reorganise expenditure, partly by reallocating budget items and modernising public administrations.
When we talk about European coordination, we should be thinking of having our own counter-cyclical governance, moving together and in the same direction, stepping up the fight against evasion and tax havens and linking national plans together. When we intervene to support businesses, we must assess the impact on competition, the level playing field and the functioning of the internal market, guaranteeing supervision, accountability, restrictions and consequent behaviour. The review of the Stability and Growth Pact permits controlled flexibility, to be used with care and long-term perspective.
A new report on the long-term stability of public finances in the European Union will be issued by the Commission in autumn 2009. The Commission also takes the European Parliament's view that public expenditure has to be reoriented in order to improve the quality of public spending in line with the Lisbon Strategy. Such a policy orientation is indeed part of the integrated policy guidelines adopted by the European Council. Work is ongoing at the Commission for a more systematic assessment of quality of public finance developments including aspects of performance-based budgeting.
In the spring of 2006 twelve Member States were going through an excessive deficit procedure. As a result of implementing the recommendations and decisions issued by the Council in the case of countries with excessive deficit, two and a half years down the line the number of Member States going through an excessive deficit procedure is approaching zero. This achievement has been possible thanks to the presence of favourable economic conditions in 2006 and 2007. During the 2008-2009 period we are facing an economic crisis which has already sparked in many Member States economic recession, a rise in unemployment and large numbers of company bankruptcies, especially among SMEs. The European economic recovery plan provides for major public investments for modernising transport and energy infrastructures. Member States are developing programmes aimed at supporting SMEs to allow them to stay in business. In these conditions, Member States in the euro zone, as well as all Member States, will find it difficult to meet the convergence criteria. I believe that measures need to be adopted at European level to enable Member States to face up to the current challenges such as an ageing population, migration, climate change etc. Agriculture, education, health and transport, which are key areas for the EU's economic development and European citizens' quality of life, must benefit from specific public policies.
We have made many new joint discoveries during the debate in committee. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has consciously put the debate on implementation relatively early on the agenda because the deadline for implementation by Member States was the middle to the end of 2007, which to date is not much time for a directive involving an enormous and significant element of harmonisation. Nevertheless, some Member States have not undertaken transposal. Certainly, this has to do with the complicated procedure, but it is interesting that three Member States who have not managed it are some of the founding Member States. Therefore, we cannot assume that they are lacking in knowledge of European law. Three Member States have not yet transposed the directive, four have done so deficiently and inadequately and three Member States have received communications from the Commission that could potentially lead to proceedings at the European Court of Justice. There are a large number of cases of deficient transposal. We established during our hearing that two countries have transposed the directive with a great deal of commitment and creativity, namely the United Kingdom and Austria. It is possible, then.
A very important point for us, as parliamentarians, was the protection of citizens and consumers from fraudulent practices. This applies not only to consumers but also to small enterprises and tradespeople. Our aim, Commissioner, should perhaps be to put these two directives together in the medium term because very many small businesses are confronted by the same irritations in the internal market as consumers. We know of many examples, such as annoying advertising and misleading and aggressive business practices. We all know the address book fraud that is a widespread problem throughout Europe. We know about cheating on the lottery and much more besides.
By implementing this Directive, the Member States not only commit themselves to establishing equality bodies that promote, assess, implement and support equal treatment, but also undertake to instigate social dialogue, with the aim of promoting equal treatment in the workplace through collective agreements, in a planned manner. They also commit to strengthening the role of NGOs in promoting equality, to establishing effective measures to penalise those who do not abide by the provisions of the directive, and to implementing protective measures for those who provide support to victims.
After this experience, I would like to stress that collaboration between the national parliaments and the European Parliament was fundamental in enabling us to do our job properly. Without the information provided by the parliaments and equality bodies, we would not have been able to write this report, at least not as thoroughly as we have done; nor would it have been possible without the mutual collaboration that we have been able to establish with the Commission, or without the invaluable help provided by the services of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, my office and the services of my parliamentary group. I would like to extend my thanks to all of these women. I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contributions and their willingness.
in writing. - In light of the persisting gap between men and women in terms of employment rates, wages and access to management positions, I call on Member States to speed up the implementation of Directive 2002/73/EC, while ensuring that its provisions are fully and effectively transposed in the national legislation. With a financial crisis unfolding, I am concerned that a slow or low quality implementation of this directive is likely to exacerbate the gender inequalities, endanger the fulfilment of the Lisbon strategy goals and prevent the EU from developing the full potential of its economic capacity.
I was pleased to read on the European Parliament's website that the topic of equal treatment for women and men is in a distinguished third place among the most read news items in 2008. The huge interest in this topic shows us however that there is still a great deal to do, especially in the area of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion. In this respect, Teresa Riera Madurell's report is a success thanks to clarifying the role of employers and civil society in promoting gender equality.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in July 2008 the European Commission presented its proposal for a revision of the existing Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), thus providing the basis for what we are debating today. We needed to stick to an extremely ambitious timetable if we wanted to ensure that we could actually succeed in revising the UCITS Directive, which has been in place since 1985 in its initial form, by the end of this parliamentary term.
The clear aim of these reforms was to improve the competitiveness of the European fund industry, to enable it to reduce its costs, to develop and make use of economies of scale, to ensure that all fund providers do indeed have access to all markets in the European Union, and to achieve all of this without reducing protection for investors: on the contrary, we wanted to improve protection for investors. In other words, we had a very ambitious programme, and I have to say that I really do appreciate the fact that, in cooperation with all the institutions involved, we have managed to conclude this project within such a short period.
Investment funds provide small investors with the option of investing small sums of capital in a diversified, professionally managed portfolio. In the past, European UCITS have already proven to be a great success story. Collective investments in transferable securities are not only sold in Europe, but are also, to a not inconsiderable extent, exported to regions outside the European Union - particularly to South America and Asia - where they are very highly regarded. That is why it was so important, when revising this directive, to ensure that we did not damage the status of these UCITS.
These include, firstly, introducing a management company passport; secondly, facilitating cross-border mergers of funds, in order to reduce the number of funds provided in the European Union and thus resolve the imbalance that can currently be seen between Europe and, in particular, the United States; thirdly, providing the possibility of master-feeder structures, in other words the option of investing one fund in another master fund and having that master fund manage the investments; fourthly, developing a short - only two pages long - information document, known as the key investor information, containing the most important information for small investors; fifthly, simplifying the notification procedure in order to ensure that, when a fund requests authorisation in a country where it is not yet authorised, this does not de facto result in a new re-authorisation; and, finally, strengthening supervisory cooperation.
I would just like to conclude with two final comments. The first is that the Commission has established a group, chaired by Jacques de Larosière, to examine the issue of supervision in Europe. I hope that the conclusions drawn by this group and the proposals it develops will ultimately be taken on board by the Commission and will find favour here. Secondly, particularly in the case of cross-border mergers of funds, we are still seeing differences in the tax treatment of cross-border mergers and national mergers. Here, too, we call on the Commission to make sure that we have the same conditions for both, not different treatment.
The proposal adopted by the Commission last July is the outcome of a thorough process of consultation. It started before the financial crisis. It sets some clear objectives for improving the functioning of the UCITS Directive. Bearing this in mind, the Commission wanted to simplify and stimulate cross-border sales of UCITS, provide fund managers with effective tools for increasing the size of their funds and benefit from economies of scale. However, it is not only about being competitive. The Commission also wanted to put in place effective rules on investor disclosure ensuring that anybody wishing to invest its savings into a UCITS should receive essential, clear and understandable information before taking his or her decision.
On the issue of supervision, I have been vocal about the need to strengthen supervisory cooperation. In Solvency II and in the amendments to the capital requirements directive, the Commission has, on my recommendation, put forward proposals to strengthen supervisory cooperation. I therefore have no difficulty in agreeing on the need to push forward in this crucial domain. Therefore, in order to ensure consistency and coherence in all relevant financial sector regulation, the Commission agrees, on the basis of the conclusions of the de Larosière report, to examine the need to strengthen the provisions of this directive related to supervisory cooperation arrangements.
The Committee on Legal Affairs, when asked for its opinion, made known its views and these were taken into account. The original UCITS Directive was the key to development for European investment funds. In June 2007, the assets managed in UCITS represented EUR 6 000 billion and UCITS accounted for around 75% of the investment fund market in the European Union. The internal guarantees provided by UCITS explain why they are recognised by investors well beyond Europe's borders. However, the regulations must change to promote the development of these funds.
Mr President, Commissioner, more than ever, I have very mixed feelings about the proposal for a directive on which Parliament is preparing to vote. It is true that the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, has been working for many years on this and has negotiated with talent, especially during the trialogue. It is also true that the directive will make some significant advances in the operation of the internal market and in the collective management of financial assets, and these have been welcomed by Europe's investment fund industry. It is still the case that the debates and discussions in the Council and Parliament have never been totally free, as the result was known in advance: for some players it was essential, at any cost, to introduce the European passport for management companies.
On the principle, there is no more to say; the passport is its own defence. However, it is necessary to ensure that the introduction of the passport for management companies is accompanied by the necessary guarantees, especially as regards the supervision of funds, as it leads to dissociation of functions beyond borders. I note with regret that the system as implemented is not only complicated but also subject to different interpretations. There is a risk that it will soon run into practical difficulties that will damage the European export fund industry, especially for export to third countries.
I have indeed noted that my position is in the minority, although I do not feel ill at ease. In normal times, I would have been tempted to say that only in practice will it be possible for definitive conclusions to be drawn on the issue and therefore to decide who is right. Is it those who trust in the abilities of market operators to adapt or those who insist on a more prudent approach? I do not exclude the possibility of success, but it is not guaranteed either. Given the latest news, especially the Madoff scandal and its implications for the collective financial assets management industry, we are unlikely to be reassured.
I am saying what I think: this directive is also from another era, from before the crisis. It is marked by a certain nonchalance. The financial system, in fact, is experiencing a lasting and fundamental crisis of confidence, and entire chunks of its architecture must be reconsidered. Let us not forget that the first duty of money market funds is to protect the investor by diversifying the risks and by establishing strict rules. By voting for this text as it stands, without really knowing where we are heading, we make it look as if nothing has happened. This withdrawal from reality will lead to no good, so I will abstain, even though I have signed the compromise amendments negotiated with the Council. Given the circumstances, the improvements made seem to me to be of little import compared with the questions of principle that I have just raised.
The work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs went ahead in a spirit of excellent cooperation due to the positive attitude of the rapporteur, whom I cannot thank enough, and the Council, perhaps because we realised that we were touching on an area that is closely connected to the financial crisis and that we urgently needed to come up with some timely and appropriate answers. I think it is important at this stage to sum up a few points on which we reached a good understanding and, I hope, good results. This is the case with management companies, particularly as regards identifying the applicable law - the law of the Member State where the fund is or where the management company was set up - in order to take us toward a clearer, safer and more efficient supervision system. It is also the case with the agreement on the Level 2 measures that the Commission has been asked to adopt by July 2010 without fail.
It also applies to the understanding that makes the management company responsible for procedures, mechanisms and contact names to enable consumers and investors to obtain specific information, not least if they have complaints to make, if the management company is not based in their Member State. We should view in a positive light the possibility of further strengthening cooperation in terms of supervision, with bilateral and multilateral agreements between the competent authorities of Member States on UCITS and management companies, and also the agreement on merger and master-feeder-structures that make it possible to operate throughout the full extent of the internal market. We still have some differences of opinion, however, on the timing of the notification procedure, because we would have liked and would still like this to be longer and more appropriate, as laid down by the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking my colleague from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Klinz, for his excellent work. In such a turbulent time as this autumn has been, the rapporteur has succeeded in finding a reasonable compromise, as we have already heard. Even without the financial crisis, these issues are difficult to deal with. I know this only too well, as I was responsible for steering through UCITS in 2001.
The aim of UCITS funds is to create not only a better and larger funds market, but also an open and consumer-friendly market. This has largely happened. Many obstacles were removed in 2001. I would like to remind everyone that it was not particularly easy then, either. It was also prior to the Lamfalussy process. A few obstacles remain, however, and it is these obstacles that are being dealt with now. There will be an improvement in marketing. There will be greater protection for investors. The merger of funds and master-feeder-structures will be possible, and cooperation between supervisory authorities will be strengthened, something that was also mentioned by the Commissioner.
Let me just say that today is a great occasion: we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the euro currency, which itself serves as an illustration of the importance of economic cooperation. It is fortunate that my own country, Ireland, is a member of the euro zone as the current currency has been a source of stability for Ireland and other countries at a time of unprecedented turbulence and during the current global recession. If Ireland were not in the euro zone, we would probably be in the unfortunate position of Iceland - but that is not the case.
UCITS are a vital part of the European - and, yes, of the Scottish - investment management industry. They are a vitally important savings vehicle for savers and investors, not just in Europe, but all over the world. Imitation is surely a sufficient compliment and, even in the US, the UCITS is the model to be aspired to. Mr Klinz has incorporated much of what I consider to be vitally important, such as diversification into new investment products and techniques with reasonable security at a common-sense level. Most importantly, we have to achieve greater economies of scale in Europe. Many of our UCITS are too small and there are too many of them, so we must facilitate mergers. Personally, I would have liked to have seen that go even further to allow UCITS with different investment objectives to be able to merge more easily, provided that the investor was adequately protected and informed of such changes.
One of the aims in revising this directive is to organise, in these conditions, an internal market in UCITS which really works. Now, there are four questions at this stage: the first, which has already been raised in this debate, is evidently that of the management passport and I heard the Commissioner tell us about his fear of seeing this passport badly prepared. However, Mr McCreevy, there needs to be a will to prepare it: I have sometimes had the impression that it was not something the Commissioner was set on achieving. I am therefore pleased about the negotiations that have begun on the initiative of the European Parliament and the Council to ensure that, when the UCITS Directive is revised, we will adopt a real management passport which will allow the European Union's internal market to function in normal conditions.
My third observation relates to the issue of supervision. I do not think anyone here will doubt our determination to seek improved supervision conditions. We are all awaiting, on the initiative of President Barroso, the results of the working group led by Jacques de Larosière. I believe that the stakes are such that we cannot wait much longer for the results of this working group to be implemented. That will have an impact on the conditions for organising supervision between the stakeholders, in other words the producers and the consumers of UCITS. We thus need the supervision issues in this area to be defined.
Mr President, first of all, I agree with the Commissioner that this is indeed not the end of the story. We now need to get started on implementation, and one reason why we have set relatively tight deadlines for Parliament and for the Council is that we want to ensure that we do not have to wait too long for implementation. We need to keep up the pace, because we can see that the markets are changing at a tremendous pace, and if we are constantly lagging behind we will not be able to achieve our targets fully, or perhaps not at all.
Mrs Berès is absolutely right: what this is really about is finally creating a real internal market in the investment funds sector. This sector is an example of the fact that, though we talk about the internal market, in many cases we do not yet have one. That is crucial. No one disputes that it will lead to a completely new and very ambitious level of cooperation, including between the supervisory bodies, but we need to achieve that in any case. In other fields, too, the supervisory bodies need to work more closely and more constructively together, and trust each other more, than they have in the past. If the UCITS directive can give a gentle nudge to encourage that, then in my opinion that is all to the good.
That, however, is not the end of things: the industry itself also needs to do its own homework. The Commission, and we here in Parliament too, have deliberately chosen not to raise the issue of fund processing at all, because we are working on the assumption that the industry will keep its promise to deal with this matter on its own, without legislative pressure. It has been working on this for quite some time now, and we still have nothing concrete to show for it. I hope that it will soon be able to put something on the table, otherwise we will have no choice but to take further action in the foreseeable future.
The first of January 2009 was the 10th birthday of our currency, the euro. Here in the European Parliament today, we are celebrating one of the most important and historic decisions that the European Union has taken so far. In a European Union that was growing ever closer economically, the creation of the euro was a logical development in strengthening the common market and simplifying trade within the internal market; even so, when the currencies of 11 sovereign states were replaced by a single currency 10 years ago, there was a great deal of scepticism as to whether the planned single currency would be a success. Its introduction required courage and decisiveness.
I agree with Helmut Kohl, who, along with François Mitterrand and Jacques Delors and others - we just saw Jacques Santer in the film - contributed to the ultimate introduction of the euro, when he said in 1998 that '... a currency is of course a means of payment. But a currency is also far more than a means of payment. It has something to do with cultural identity and it is a measure of political stability ... Imagine what a marvellous achievement it is that in the European Union ..., with all our intelligence, creativity and colourful variety, and in spite of all the difficulties ..., millions of our people should have a single currency.'
The European Parliament and its committee responsible for such matters, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, chaired at the time by Karl von Wogau and then by Christa Randzio-Plath, have also had a part to play as a driving force in this historic project over the years leading from the currency snake to the creation of the single currency. The same applies to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in its current incarnation, chaired by Pervenche Berès, to whom we are grateful for the idea of this celebration.
(DE) The last few months have demonstrated another advantage of the euro. The financial crisis has shown that, in times of turbulence, it is better to be in a large, safe ship than in a small boat. Would we in Europe have been able to act as quickly, as decisively and as consistently without the single currency to bind us together? Would we have been in a position to protect our individual national currencies from the impact of the financial crisis? We can be proud of how Europe's parliaments, governments and central banks have responded. Together, we have shown that, even in very difficult circumstances, Europe can make decisions.
The European Parliament played a crucial role at the pioneering stage. Parliament was the first institution in Europe to make proposals for a single currency, back in 1962. In the past 10 years, since the establishment of the ECB, our institutions have maintained a very close and fruitful dialogue. This dialogue has involved over 50 hearings of the members of the Executive Board of the ECB before this Parliament and the committees mentioned by the President. The dialogue between Parliament and the ECB is very important in terms of accountability, allowing the ECB to explain its decisions and actions to the general public through their elected representatives.
During its first years of existence, the euro had to face three major trials: the establishment of a sound and credible central bank, the creation of a stable new currency and inspiring confidence. These challenges were successfully overcome and the euro is firmly established today. This is a time for celebration and, as I said, I am very moved. But this is no time for complacency. Current challenges are pressing and new challenges will arise. The continued success of EMU depends on how these challenges are addressed.
The path which led to the creation of the Economic and Monetary Union and the introduction of our single currency was a long one, and the genesis of the Economic and Monetary Union after the initial impulse of the Werner report in 1970 demonstrates this. It was a long genesis which went via the monetary snake, the European Monetary System, the creation of the ecu in 1979, the 1989 Delors plan, the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, and also the Danish 'no' and the French 'yes', which at the time was said to be small, without forgetting the 1993 crisis in the European Monetary System. The journey has not been without its difficulties and shocks.
It is important for me to take advantage of the 10th anniversary of this key event in European integration to pay homage, in my turn, to those men who created the euro, such as Pierre Werner, Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand, Jacques Delors, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and others. I would like, once again, to applaud their vision, their determination and their unfailing commitment to Europe. Those I have mentioned, and many others who accompanied them, could not have imagined the rapid success of their political project. Since 1 January of this year, 16 Member States have been participating in the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro is the currency of almost 330 million European citizens. The euro, then, has become the most tangible sign of European integration. As a tangible sign recognised around the world, the euro is a measure of stability. It is protecting its citizens from the most serious consequences of the economic crisis. After 10 years, it has to be recognised that the euro is an unquestionable success. Now, anniversaries only have value if they are bridges to the future, as we have to recognise that, despite our collective indulgence as we congratulate ourselves, the true tests for the cohesiveness and coherence of the euro area await us. This year, 2009, will be an extremely difficult year for the euro area economies and for European citizens and there will be many challenges facing us, both internally and externally.
Internally, euro area governments will have to act together to contain the effects of the economic crisis and invest in the structural bases of the economy to build a bridge to the post-crisis world. Exceptional situations demand exceptional measures. We must not lose sight of the fact that the euro, this protective screen we have built around our economies, did not just fall into our laps. The euro area economies are better protected against negative economic developments because being part of the euro area is a mark of quality certifying that its members have a real capacity for implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and policies based on sustained growth and prosperity for its citizens. The protection afforded by the euro is therefore directly linked to our credibility, which rests on the ability to implement such policies. This credibility is the foundation of the benefits of Economic and Monetary Union and we must maintain it to continue fully to profit from the benefits of the single currency.
Externally, we have to learn the political lessons from the international financial and economic crisis. There is a direct causal link between the current crisis, with its origins in the United States, and the persistence of major world imbalances. The lack of sufficient transparency, responsibility and integrity in the financial sector therefore acted as a catalyst for the crisis. The re-establishment of stability in the financial and the real economy on a world scale implies a profound reform of the financial system and the elimination of the major imbalances in the mix of global consumption and global saving. This balancing demands the active cooperation of the major economies in America, Asia and Europe. Despite noticeable progress, the euro's international image remains, too often, overly fragmented and national interests too often win out over the common interest, preventing the euro area from fully assuming the political responsibility that corresponds to its economic importance and from achieving all of the economic benefits deriving from Economic and Monetary Union. Economic and Monetary Union is, of course, an economic project, but it is, first of all, a political project. As a result, we must take advantage of the euro's second decade to perfect the Economic and Monetary Union by strengthening its political bodies, both internally and externally.
I would like to pay tribute to all those who mapped out this course and those who have followed it. We can find its distant origins in the report from the Luxembourg prime minister, Pierre Werner, your predecessor, in 1970. It was, however, the monetary crisis in the years that followed and the currency flotation which triggered action in this area. As long as the currency exchange rates were fixed, the monetary system did not upset our attempt to create a common market. However, as soon as they were floating, this problem raised its head.
Let us salute the pioneers who have been involved in this along the way, as you yourself have recently, Mr President, as well as my friend, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and his Secretary of State, Manfred Lahnstein; Bernard Clappier, the governor of the Banque de France at the time and co-author of Robert Schuman's Declaration in 1950; Alexandre Lamfalussy, who provided us with his great, almost unique expertise during the work of the committee on European monetary union which we set up with Helmut Schmidt to relaunch the project; Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, who took over; and, last but not least, the negotiators and signatories of the Maastricht Treaty who drafted an excellent text, which has not actually been touched since then, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President François Mitterrand, whose determination must be mentioned in particular, along with their other colleagues. Today we must say a big 'thank you' to all of them.
On this occasion of the 10th anniversary, being celebrated at a time of crisis, what can we say in support of the euro? What fine words can we use in our anniversary toasts? First of all, the euro's success has exceeded expectations, not only of all its opponents, of course, but even of all its supporters. I will not go into detail as you have only given me five minutes. During the conversations which I had with the most eminent monetary experts between 1995 and 2000, they were all sceptical about the possibility of introducing the euro and making it a success.
We are expecting the monetary policy to try to contain, within the limits of the currency's power, the depressing impact of the crisis and to pave the way for the return to non-inflationary growth, which we are not tackling yet, by which time the sizeable public deficits and level of debt triggered by the crisis ought to have been cleared. In this respect, we are putting our trust in the managers and staff at the European Central Bank, who have demonstrated their considerable expertise since the start of the crisis. We also respect their determination and independence.
Finally, I do not think that the general public will need to wait too long for banking regulation to be restored in the euro area. It seems to me that we could call on the European Central Bank to carry out this process of restoring order and supervise its implementation, according to Article 106(5) of the Maastricht Treaty. Indeed, we need a strong impetus, expertise and a decision timetable which the European Central Bank could draw up and which the Council of Ministers for the euro area, presided by your good self, Mr Juncker, could then adopt and implement.
I also want, of course, on this occasion to salute and thank on our behalf, on our children's behalf and on everyone else's behalf, the founding fathers and the architects of this success: Pierre Werner, who is with us, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, President Giscard d'Estaing, the President of the European Commission Jacques Delors, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President François Mitterrand, Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Philippe Maystadt and everyone else whom I have not mentioned. I would also, however, like to pay tribute to the actions of your predecessors, Mr President, the actions of my predecessors, Karl von Wogau, who is still with us, and of Christa Randzio-Plath, who is also with us today. The actions of this Parliament played a crucial role in that, at the time of the transition to the euro, we were not only concerned about the transfer of accounts in the banks but also about our citizens, so that they could adapt to, get used to and adopt this new currency which was going to be theirs. I also believe that this action by our institution must be recalled and given credit.
Of course, we are not all using the euro. There were 11 of us to start with, and now there are 16. We are expecting others to join us. However, I do get the feeling that this crisis is tempting some countries to reconsider whether they should belong to the euro area or not. I think that this is the best proof of our success. Europe makes progress, as is so often the case, by demonstrating its efficiency and on this occasion to mark its 10th anniversary, we can clearly see that the assessment of the euro is largely a positive one. Some countries which were hesitant could now knock on the door of the euro area. We can only encourage them to do this under the terms of the Treaty, which have never been revised and which are useful terms allowing Europe to progress in economic and monetary matters on the basis of the two pillars of consolidation and enlargement.
On the subject of economic cooperation, Jean-Claude Juncker described the crisis that we are going through. It is not a normal situation. In this current crisis we all know that, if we had made progress in the Economic Union as quickly as we have in the Monetary Union, we would be even better off today. Let us learn then the lessons from this. It is not normal for us to focus on the budget deficit balances and not on the quality of public spending. Governments must learn to talk together about their economic policies. It is not normal for Member States to borrow at such different rates of interest when they have the same currency and the same rate of interest set by the European Central Bank.
The same applies when it comes to supervising the financial markets. President Giscard d'Estaing mentioned Article 105(6), which is our common platform, allowing us to make progress. I think that one of the lessons from this crisis is that it actually shows that the European Central Bank will need to have a supervisory role. We do not want to disconnect the supervision of the financial markets from macroprudential supervision. However, to achieve this, we will also need, as political leaders, to think about achieving a balance. If the European Central Bank sees its responsibilities strengthened, it will have to be indicated how the institutional balance on the whole needs to be established in the future.
Mr President, 10 years of the euro is indeed a reason to celebrate. Anyone who had said 10 years ago that the euro would have developed as splendidly as it has done would have been laughed at. Many people have contributed to this success, and I remember many sceptical voices - it was referred to as a premature baby and an unviable project - and today we know that it was a vision to which many people contributed. The previous speaker reminded us of all those who contributed to this, of the milestones, of the European monetary system, which was an agreement with the European Central Bank to create central rates, of the Delors report, which provided for the introduction of the monetary union in three stages, of the Treaty of Maastricht - only two years after the fall of the Wall - and of the transitional periods. Many people have helped to make the euro the successful project it is today.
As the committee chairman, Mrs Berès, has already said, during this period, in particular from 1994 when the implementation of the Treaty of Maastricht began, and up to 2002, Parliament actively cooperated in the introduction of the notes and coins, and in many reports, discussions, opinions and also proposals, and I would like specifically to thank the two committee chairmen from that time, Mr von Wogau and Mrs Randzio-Plath, who also represented Parliament to the outside world and who gave this project, although originally created by the governments, the parliamentary support it needed. We are working today, too, under the chairmanship of Mrs Berès, for the same representation.
The euro has been a great success, and it is a unique project: a central monetary policy under the management of the European Central Bank and local budgetary and finance policies. It is important that, in future, the connection between these two levels of responsibility in the Stability and Growth Pact are retained also during times of crisis. Without this Stability and Growth Pact, without stronger coordination of the budgetary and finance policy, the euro would also in future face risks that are avoidable. In this regard, I appeal in particular to the Member States of the euro area, but also to the whole of the European Union, to take this discipline, this coordinated cooperation, more seriously than has been the case in the past in connection with certain issues.
The euro has pushed down inflation considerably and so created confidence and stability, and it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency in a space of time that no one thought it capable of. The euro has increased the pressure for structural reform in the Member States and therefore, even in the age of globalisation, has become a 'fitness programme' for undertakings and for nations. The institutions of the euro area - several were mentioned by the previous speaker - the Ecofin Council, the Euro Group and many other institutions have created the necessary conditions together with the Commission and the European Central Bank, because they were already operating, because they were in place, because they worked independently in order to react quickly, reliably and correctly in the economic crisis.
It must be said, however, that among our fellow citizens and until recently there were mixed perceptions of the euro. For those who travel, the advantage of a single currency was obvious. For those who do not, the euro was associated with price rises. Studies have, in fact, shown that in most countries inflation was felt even though the official figures showed that, due especially to the action of the European Central Bank, monetary stability had been ensured. The reality is that some definitely took advantage of the euro to round up some prices and perhaps consumers were not vigilant enough.
The welcome results of the euro must encourage us to continue and to broaden the coordination of economic policies and to respect the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is true, at present, that exceptions may and perhaps should be accepted, but they can only be temporary and the objective of balanced public finances must be retained. High-quality public finances and economic policies are, in fact, in the long run, more than ever necessary. They are the guarantee of effectiveness, competiveness and growth. They are the condition for the solidity of our currency, the euro.
Mr President, during these times of uncertainty, it is important to be able to count on something with a reliable value: the euro. As I was able to play a bit-part as a member of the Ecofin Council during the period of preparation for the future single currency, I could see the doubts on both sides of the argument and the pussyfooting of the Member States, which ultimately made the Eurogroup into a stronger forum for cooperation ahead of its time. Furthermore, two of Europe's finest achievements came about through the determination of a few states to forge ahead in making integration something real for all our fellow citizens. I am referring to the Schengen Agreement entailing the free movement of Europeans, which was implemented on the initiative of five states: France, with President Mitterrand, Germany, with Chancellor Kohl, along with the Benelux countries. Switzerland has now become part of the Schengen area, but the British and Irish are still shying away from this people's Europe.
President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl were also the political architects of the euro, even though there were many who supported this monetary success, starting with Jacques Delors. The first lesson I would like to draw from this is that anyone who wants a better Europe must not be afraid of intergovernmental action, especially if there is a coalition of states which really want to move Europe forward. The Prüm Treaty, which is intended to combat serious crime, is an example of this positive enhanced cooperation for Europe. At a time when the Constitutional Treaty is dead and buried, following the 'no' vote from a strange coalition of political forces not only in France but in the Netherlands too, and when the indigestible piece of legislation known as the 'mini' Treaty of Lisbon is being blocked in Ireland and possibly in the Czech Republic as well, we should prove that Europe is still functioning by relying on the huge area of enhanced cooperation.
In any case, the attraction of the euro remains intact. Following Slovenia, Slovakia has just joined us. Others are fretting about not being able to benefit more from the protective shield provided by the euro. Even in the UK voices are being raised, questioning the country's splendid isolation in the face of the pound's collapse, which has seen its status fall from that of the world's reserve currency to a run-of-the-mill currency in less than a century. Thanks to the consistent actions of Wim Duisenberg, Jean-Claude Trichet and the likes, the euro has become the world's second reserve currency in 10 years. Of course, the dollar remains king for global transactions, still providing a safe investment, but the colossal debts accumulated by the United States in getting the rest of the world to finance their lifestyle will increasingly sow the seeds of doubt as to the ability of the number one economic power to honour its commitments. In fact, the financial world is tending towards a euro/dollar duopoly. Any monetary duopoly regularly goes through parity adjustments which often occur suddenly. In these times of widespread recession, the world needs stability and new certainties. The euro will have a key role to play in this new stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) has done what it needed to do in the face of a global financial crisis 'made in the USA'.
As Jacques Delors said, the euro is the shield to protect the whole of Europe, but the euro has not stimulated the European economy enough so far. The ECB is only in charge of monetary policy. At the end of the day, the Commission is only a first-class consultant making suggestions which are generally useful, but the real economic players remain the states themselves which, unfortunately, are operating in a disorganised manner. Although the effective harmonisation of the cumulative economic power of 27 states could work miracles, the Eurogroup, in spite of the commendable efforts of Jean-Claude Juncker, still only remains an informal discussion group. In the spring of 1999, I was able to witness the attempt made within the Eurogroup by a few finance ministers, including Oskar Lafontaine, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Carlo Ciampi and a few others, to establish economic and monetary cooperation between the European Union and the European Central Bank. Wim Duisenberg made the cutting retort: 'there never will be any ex-ante coordination with the European Central Bank as you are always going to have to react ex-post to our decisions.' The reason for this is obvious: the ECB is and will remain independent in conducting its monetary policy, but independence does not mean a ban on constructive dialogue between institutions tasked with defending the interests and common destiny of 500 million Europeans. There is nothing to prevent states from organising themselves better with regard to achieving proper coordination of their economic policies, whether it is inside the EU or especially when representing Europe externally, as Jean-Claude Juncker so sensibly concluded just now.
Mr President, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I find it very regrettable that relatively few Members are here today for this formal sitting, because it really is a historic event. We have already heard from the various previous speakers how much scepticism there was when the euro was first introduced. It was felt that the logistical challenges involved in introducing billions of banknotes and coins alone would be unmanageable, and the idea that we could combine a common monetary policy with separate fiscal policies in the Member States was seen not just as a major challenge but as simply impossible.
It could, I think, be said that, in the European Central Bank's first few years, Europe and the European economy were sailing in relatively calm waters, so that the bank found it pretty easy to pursue a policy of stability. Even so, it is worth pointing out that the mean inflation rate over the first 10 years of the euro has been approximately 2%, in other words more or less on the target that the European Central Bank set itself. The German mark, on the other hand, which was always held up as a poster child for stability, had a mean inflation rate of 3% over its 50 years of existence. It can therefore be said that the European Central Bank has performed very well.
However, it is now, in this time of crisis, that the European Central Bank is showing its true strength, its true quality. It has a hugely important role to play here. It has proven itself to be independent, efficient and self-confident, and it acts decisively and quickly. It has become an example for some central banks, both in those European countries that are not yet part of the euro area and outside Europe. It has made it quite clear to the Federal Reserve in the United States that it can pursue a successful policy, not despite its independence but precisely because it is politically independent and not subject to instructions from various governments.
We now know that at the moment, after the banking sectors in the individual Member States have been brought under a protective umbrella, the Member States are in the process of developing various economic stimulus plans to absorb the negative impact of the financial crisis on the real economy. This will present the European Central Bank with further challenges, because there is a risk that the differences in approach will result in distortions of competition, and that the convergence we have, in part, now achieved between the members of the euro area will be lost and we will see increasingly divergent developments. This needs to be counteracted, which is why it is so crucial and so important that the Stability and Growth Pact must not be undermined or discarded. Quite the reverse: we must ensure that it remains valid. That is why it is also so important for the necessary structural reforms, which the Commission and the European Central Bank have repeatedly called for in the past, actually to be pursued in the individual Member States.
The European Central Bank will gain a new task in the coming years. The crisis has taught us that we need some kind of European supervision of the financial market, and this is an area where the European Central Bank can play a major role. It has signalled that it is, in principle, willing to introduce some kind of central European supervisory system analogous to the European System of Central Banks. The euro's international role needs to be further strengthened. The euro area needs to speak with one voice, and also be represented as a unit in international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).
It is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is, and will continue to be, a risky undertaking. This is no mere bagatelle. The EU is still facing some major challenges: we are facing high, and unfortunately rising, levels of unemployment, demographic changes, migratory pressures, increasing poverty in some sectors of society, and stiffer competition in the context of globalisation. The euro area will only be able to meet these challenges if the economic policies of the Member States can be more closely interlinked. The appointment of a president of the euro area was the first step in this direction, but it is only the first step: more is now needed.
Some problems that have occurred are due to inefficiencies in a system that was unprepared for the task of guiding the other great associated phenomenon; I am talking about the increasing pace of internationalisation and the great changes in the way trade is conducted at international level. The euro has made it possible to face up to a series of difficulties, the most severe of which is the current financial crisis, and it has protected us against the great stresses that have ravaged the markets. Were it not for the euro, we would have repeated the experience of 1992, only worse.
We mark this 10th anniversary by warmly welcoming the entrance of Slovakia, the 16th country to join the euro area. The measures introduced by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Commission to combat the current crisis have acted as a buffer and a form of containment but we still maintain, as we have often done in this Chamber, that we find it inconceivable to have a monetary policy disconnected from economic policy. Admittedly, the actual situation is somewhat anomalous: 16 Member States with the single currency, 27 national economic policies coordinated by the Commission as well as it can, and 11 Member States with national currencies.
We hope that recent experiences convince people of the need to face up to change in Europe, restoring the real economy to the centre and ensuring better cohesion and connection between the ECB and the European institutions responsible for laying down political and planning strategy. The very recent energy crisis has also shown us that a common economic policy on the main strategic topics is of vital interest to the public and cannot be delayed. If the political will is present, the introduction of such a policy will be facilitated by the growing power of the euro.
Why were we against the euro at that time? There were basically two reasons for it. Firstly, it seemed to us that the Maastricht criteria were going to drag Europe into at least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and, secondly, the way in which the monetary policy was incorporated into the general economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty was not satisfactory. For the sake of the European Central Bank's independence, we would separate monetary policy from the rest of the policies.
Three major changes have taken place. Firstly, price stability has been established at a level of slightly less than, but close to, 2%. This target may seem a bit absurd. At the moment, when the world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily cut their VAT rate as part of a Keynesian policy, it is obvious that setting this target of 2% is no longer just for show. If we fail to keep to this 2% target we run the risk of having very high real interest rates being forced on us.
The third major transformation is the change to how things work in practice. This permanent dialogue, as highlighted once again in this Chamber, between Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso, is, strictly speaking, contrary to the Maastricht Treaty itself. I regard this form of cooperation between Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia, for example, to be the equivalent of that between Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson, which is a positive and desirable development. What remains to be done then? All I would say is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of the Maastricht Treaty.
It is unacceptable that we are holding onto ideological dogmas, such as price stability and the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, which are being used as a pretext in order to pursue privatisation and remove responsibility for social functions from the state. This approach also involves the idea of the minimal state and the greater efficiency of the private sector, with the aim of imposing acceptance of so-called wage restraint, which actually results in low, nominal wage rises and even a reduction in real wages, as the Portuguese case regrettably clearly demonstrates.
This European Central Bank policy has resulted in the contraction of the European economy, clearly demonstrating the need for further reductions in the reference interest rates. As the purchasing power of workers, the retired and pensioners has fallen over the last 10 years, the profits of economic and financial groups have reached their highest level in 30 years, resulting in the joy and satisfaction that we have heard in this Chamber. Even now, in the crisis situation that they have caused, what they are doing is nationalising the damage in order to then privatise the profits, whilst workers, micro- and small entrepreneurs, the retired and the unemployed suffer the consequences of the crisis, with the right, in the best-case scenario, only to a few scraps. Look at what is happening in the financial sector, where certain banks have already increased their spreads more than once since the start of the financial crisis and where the margin charged has doubled in the space of a year, thereby penalising new credit even more.
We therefore insist on the urgent need for a proper break with these neoliberal and monetarist policies, putting an end to the Stability Pact, tax havens and the false independence of the European Central Bank. We therefore insist on the need to significantly increase the EU budget based on a fair distribution of income and wealth, so that there is a real policy of economic and social cohesion and so that we reject measures that are just more of the same, in other words 'save yourself if you can' measures, allowing the richest to become ever richer and the poor to become ever poorer, as clearly demonstrated by the increasing inequalities and disparities among the euro area economies.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, do enjoy the 10th birthday of the euro because I very much doubt you will be celebrating the 20th. What we have seen this morning has been reminiscent of the old Soviet times. Do you remember when the five-year plans were announced to be successes often before they were even launched, with much talk of record harvests and wonderful production figures for tractors? Much like those days, we have been treated this morning to a succession of unelected, ageing bureaucrats telling us what a great success the whole thing has been. It is all delusional stuff.
The idea that the ECB has done a good job is extraordinary. It was last July when the European Central Bank put interest rates up, just at the very moment that the markets were going into meltdown and rates were being slashed across the rest of the world. Of course none of this surprises me because what this euro is all about is a political class imposing its will upon the peoples of Europe. Remember that only two countries - Denmark and Sweden - had a referendum on the euro and both of them said 'no', that little word that you try and avoid if you possibly can.
The euro zone has never been tested but it is about to be. Spain is in economic trouble. Italy, as German economists at the time said, should never have joined the euro, but the situation in Greece is, I think, where we should focus our attention. Thousands of young people out on the streets demonstrating, demanding their government does something, demanding that their government cuts rates, demanding that their government devalues. But the Greek Government is stuck inside the euro straitjacket. There is nothing it can do. There is nothing that a future general election can do in Greece to change anything. When people have taken away from them the ability to determine their own futures through the ballot box, then I am afraid that violence becomes the only logical alternative.
What you have done with this euro is you have trapped people in an economic prison. You have trapped people in a Völkerkerker from which it will take great courage to get out. It will take leadership, or possibly the inevitable economic meltdown. You can boo, you can jeer, but remember this: Britain outside of the euro has been able to devalue, has been able to slash interest rates. We have been able to do the things that we need to do. Jeer on if you like, but have you noticed that on the bond markets this morning Greek bonds are trading 233 basis points higher than German bonds? Now I know that most of you in this room will not even know what that means and those that do will do their best to ignore it. You can go on burying your heads in the sand if you want. You can ignore the markets if you want to, but in time the markets will not ignore you.
Mr President, in the last 200 years there have been at least half a dozen attempts to create single currencies or fixed exchange rate mechanisms. All have failed, all have damaged the participants, and so it is with the euro. The imbalances long predicted by sceptics are starting to bite. Italy's competitiveness is shot to pieces. Spain's experience is like the bull in the corrida: proud and strong to start with, but bleeding to death in the sand by the end. Greece's recent unrest is clearly linked to unemployment, resulting from an overvalued euro. Bond spreads between Greece and Germany have reached unprecedented levels - over 200 basis points.
Thirdly, new Member States which are preparing to enter the euro area have to comply with many monetary and fiscal criteria two years before entry. Some of these criteria are mutually contradictory, such as the need to be present in the ERM II system - and therefore the need to maintain the national currency's exchange rate against the euro within a fluctuation band of ±15% - and at the same time to maintain a low level of inflation. Counteracting devaluation pressure on the national currency means the need for intervention by central banks, which means putting greater amounts of the national currency into circulation, which obviously increases inflationary pressure. As the Commission wants to encourage new Member States, it should consider eliminating this obvious inconsistency.
Although the 10th anniversary of the euro is overshadowed by worries of a possible deepening of the recession, I trust in the euro area's ability to emerge from the crisis. This will nevertheless require considerable effort on the part of the Union. According to the latest estimates, the effect of the agreed stimulus package will be considerably less than the 1.5% of gross domestic product planned for the area. According to current estimates, it will be around 0.6%. An additional stimulus is needed.
The introduction of the European single currency and the creation of EMU were joint decisions made through harmonisation and solidarity based on European values. This is the kind of attitude which we also need this year in order to devise and successfully implement measures to combat the financial crisis. Europe's competitiveness has to be maintained within the euro area and must be boosted in Member States which are preparing to join the euro area. Furthermore, EMU members' diverse interests must take secondary priority to the EU's common economic interests.
It falls to me on this occasion to explain my vote in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade and economic relations with Western Balkans. I am absolutely in favour of the European Union making it as easy as possible for these Balkan states to join the European Union. I believe that it is important for economic aid to be higher than that allocated to date, and that we should make it possible to increase links between the Balkan states and Europe, develop tourism and allow all Balkan citizens, young and old, to live a better life than they have until now.
Madam President, I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to explain why I abstained on the McGuinness report. It focuses on a very important aspect of the European Union and that is the absolute essentiality of ensuring food supplies to those who are starving or those who do not have a proper food supply. Nobody could be against that, and I am certainly not against that. But the problem with the report, in my view, is that it looks and refers to the common agricultural policy and does not address the fact that there is an urgent need for the reform, and further reform, of that policy.
Price rises are felt most by low-income families, who spend a significant proportion of their budget on food. It is just such people who deserve help: the most needy people, both in developing countries and in the European Union. I agree that the common agricultural policy should be adapted to the new conditions in order to better address the problems of food security, and this is why the removal of instruments which manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU expenditure on agriculture in the future financial perspective should be opposed.
I think most people in this Chamber, from whatever part of the political spectrum they come from, would agree that food security is very important. The problem is that we do not agree on what food security is. To many of us, food security is making sure that there is enough food for the people of the world - wherever they come from. For others, it is an excuse for protectionism. Food security to them means only food produced in the EU for Europeans. 'Local production' is a phrase that I often hear used. I hear people using the excuse of food security to keep out imports from the rest of the world, thereby condemning the high-quality exports that we see from many of the poorer countries of the world and condemning many more farmers in poorer countries to poverty.
The first issues involves the reduction in producer costs, which will lead to greater global competitiveness. The second issue is the reduction in the volatility of food markets, especially by increasing stocks. The third issue concerns halting the decline in the social importance of agriculture by increasing public awareness of its unique and irreplaceable role. The fourth issue concerns ending the random operation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) by implementing a systemic organisation of the policy with a focus on long-term objectives. The fifth and final issue involves putting a stop to the agricultural decline in the new Member States caused by the CAP's discriminatory principles, while significantly boosting utilisation of wasted agricultural potential in these countries, the new Member States.
Madam President, this goes to the core of this whole European Union. Here we are approving more money to try and persuade the public to vote for the wretched Lisbon Treaty. The public, on being given a chance in the Republic of Ireland, made it absolutely clear that they do not want it and if the people of Britain were to be given a chance - and they should have been because they were promised it in the last general election by the Labour Government - they would also vote overwhelmingly to reject this Treaty.
When I read the title of the report, 'Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon', it reminded me of a phrase by Mahatma Gandhi. When he was asked about Western civilisation, he said, that 'that would be a good idea'. Therefore, when I read this title, 'Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon', I thought, 'that would be a good idea, would it not?' If only we had civil dialogue. If only we had two-way dialogue. One of the previous speakers said that dialogue is very much a two-way process, but if we look at some of the civil society organisations being funded in order to promote the Treaty of Lisbon, we only see organisations that are fully signed up to promoting this fundamentally undemocratic Treaty. How many organisations that are against the Treaty will be funded or will be allowed to be promoted? There is no two-way dialogue, and that is why the citizens of the EU, when they are given the chance and asked about the Treaty of Lisbon, will choose to reject it.
Madam President, thank you all for your patience in the Chamber. I wanted to speak on this but I have just got too much to say today, I am so excited by all the votes that have been going through the Chamber today. Yes, the common fisheries policy; yes, let us talk about sustainable development - but the two are inherently contradictory. If you want to look at a sustainable fisheries policy, you have to look at property rights and market-based solutions. Look at those countries where fishermen are given rights that are tradable and passed on from generation to generation. That is the best way to make sure that we have sustainable fish stocks, not some artificial communistic method where you have central planning in fishing. That is why we are seeing great depletion of fish stocks, and we will all suffer in the end.
Mr President of the Republic of Latvia, the right honourable Valdis Zatlers, it is a very great pleasure for us all to be able to welcome you today on your first visit to the European Parliament. I should like to start by thanking you, as the President of a country which is still a relatively new Member State of the European Union, for accepting the European Parliament's invitation to address us today, the day on which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of our common currency, the euro. Today is a premiere in every sense of the word, as this was the first time that the European hymn has been played to welcome a guest to plenary here in the European Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the President for his kind words of introduction and his invitation to address the elected representatives of the nations of Europe. I am honoured to have this opportunity. I take great pleasure in addressing the European Parliament in my mother tongue, especially because for five years now, Latvian has been one of the official languages of the European Union. I am speaking to you today at a time when the term of office of the first Members of the European Parliament to be elected from Latvia is drawing to a close. I thank you for having carried out your duties with distinction.
Dear friends, this year, 2009, is a very significant year for Latvia. It is five years since Latvia acceded to the European Union and to NATO. Membership of these international organisations became a strategic aim for Latvia following the restoration of independence in 1991. Latvia clearly expressed its wish to participate in European and transatlantic economic and security structures. The enlargement of the family of European democratic nations in the first decade of the 21st century represented the most dynamic changes in Europe since the foundation of the European Union. These were significant changes. European structures were joined by nations that had long been isolated by force from them, even though the values that lie at the heart of the European Union had historically been rooted in these nations.
On 18 November last year, Latvia celebrated the 90th anniversary of its proclamation. That anniversary was highly significant for our people. It once again affirmed our steadfast will to live in an independent, free and democratic nation. In the act declaring the Republic of Latvia in 1918 it is written that: 'All citizens regardless of their ethnic origin are called on to give their assistance, for all human rights shall be guaranteed in Latvia. It shall be a democratic and just nation, where there shall be no room for oppression and injustice ...'. I am very proud of these words. Thirty years before the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Republic of Latvia declared its loyalty to its fundamental values and principles.
Latvia has always felt itself to belong to Europe and its values, even when Latvia and other Central and Eastern European nations were long bound to a state where many values were looked at through a special ideological prism. Peace reigned among the nations of the Eastern bloc, but it was the peace of the prison courtyard. It was brought about by the presence of tanks, repression and threats. Last year, ladies and gentlemen, both you and the whole of Europe were reminded of the inhumanity of totalitarian ideology by Edvīns Šnore's film 'A Soviet Story'. We have a common history, but our fates have been diverse. You have to look back into the past in order to understand one another and look to the future together. That is why I should like to thank the European Parliament for the declaration adopted on 22 September last year to proclaim 23 August as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism. This declaration reminds the people of Europe of these tragic events in the history of Latvia and the whole of Europe.
Today, I should like to look at much more recent history. This year marks five years since Latvia became a member of the European Union and of NATO. What sort of time has this been for Latvia? What has our nation gained? What have our nation's achievements been and what are the challenges still ahead of us? Firstly, the aspiration to become part of Europe encouraged the consolidation of democracy in our society and contributed to the development of democratic institutions. With our accession to the European Union, Latvia signalled its determination for its own future, its determination to found its future on a European identity and on our common values: freedom and democracy, accountability, the rule of law and human rights, equality, tolerance and prosperity. Secondly, membership of the European Union has improved the investment climate in Latvia. 'European money', as we commonly call European Union structural funds, has contributed significantly to the development of Latvia's economy. Thirdly, we can enjoy the privileges afforded by the free movement of persons. Free travel in the Schengen area has become so customary and self-evident; it has become so natural to learn, work and gain experience in other European Union Member States. Fourthly, the free movement of goods and services has opened up new opportunities for business. Every entrepreneur and consumer can operate in a free environment without borders and without customs duties. For us in a country with a small internal market, this is particularly important. Fifthly, and most important of all, Latvian voices are heard in Europe and European voices are heard in the world. We can be proud that we have at our disposal such a unique mechanism of collaboration. It allows all of us to search together for active solutions to global challenges, climate and demographic change, the reinforcement of energy security, the problems of migration, and in the case of financial crisis, on a worldwide scale. Latvia now has at its disposal new political and economic instruments, but it must be noted that our nation's responsibility for the common future of Europe, a responsibility before all the people of Europe, has also significantly increased.
Looking back at our achievements, we must also be critical and own up to mistakes that have been committed. After accession to the European Union, the Latvian government lapsed into a sense of a 'job well done'; it had achieved its goal. We did not recognise that we were only at the beginning and not at the end of the process. The European Union offers great opportunities, but each nation and each society must grasp them by itself. We in Latvia have not grasped all the opportunities; we have not always wisely implemented cohesion policy or made use of the financial opportunities we have been offered. Our state institutions had to learn how to live in the European Union. We have not been sufficiently determined to adopt the euro; that is one of the greatest mistakes we have made in the euro integration process, something that is acutely evident today in the circumstances of the financial crisis.
Yet even the most hardened Eurosceptic must admit that Latvia's membership of the European Union has on the whole been positive. Is there anyone in Latvia who wants to return to a Europe where there are customs barriers between nations? No! Is there anyone who wants to wait in a queue at the border in order to enter a neighbouring country? No! Is there anyone who wants to return to a world where there are restrictions on the free movement of workers, on their education and on their gaining experience? Of course not! Even Eurosceptics soon get used to good things, and become simply sceptics.
Ladies and gentlemen, the deterioration of the situation within the financial system and economy in recent months has irreversibly changed the role and significance of national governments within economic processes. Until now, the financial markets were able to develop very freely. We were persuaded that the laws of the market would by themselves be sufficiently efficient in promoting economic development. We believed that the market alone would put everything in its place. That is indeed what happens. The market regulates itself. What we can see from this global crisis, however, is that our financial systems and our economies are suffering from that market, and most important of all, real people are suffering from the crisis. The course of events at the end of last year has shown us that it is essential for national governments to play a more active part in the economic process. The previous approach, of nodding off at the wheel of economic management, was irresponsible. Unfortunately, we have awoken too late. Late enough to still espy the obstacle - the financial morass - on the road ahead of us, but no longer able to avoid it.
In this situation, a complex approach at national, European and global level is what is needed. At the global level, coordinated action to restart economic growth is essential. That will only be possible by designing a new architecture and mechanisms for the financial system. It will be vital to supervise the system strictly, without simultaneously limiting initiative or market processes. The most difficult challenge will be to strike precisely this balance. At the European level, we have a significant advantage, for we can implement coordinated measures, take united action and achieve a sustainable solution. We welcome the Commission's European Economic Recovery Plan. It is an important step out of the morass in which we find ourselves at this time.
I shall spend a little more time on national-level solutions. The global financial crisis has also hit Latvia. There is a school of thought which suggests that Latvia is currently undergoing one of the most dramatic rescue operations of any financial system in modern European history. Currently, Latvia is working on measures to stimulate the economy in order to stabilise the financial and economic situation swiftly and effectively. It is a difficult task, but we shall succeed in overcoming the crisis only by seeing a clear way out of it, and not by mistaking short-term solutions for a long-term vision of economic development.
At the end of last year, six political parties represented in the Latvian parliament, from both government and opposition, agreed on a common stance of support for the economic stabilisation plan drawn up by the Latvian government. This agreement provides for special attention to be paid to monitoring how the loan granted to Latvia is utilised. The plan defines the medium-term priorities for Latvia's economy: support for exports, the promotion of free and fair competition, a significant reduction in the current-account deficit in the balance of payments, and the introduction of the euro in 2012. Accession to the euro area has become one of our nation's most important strategic goals. It is important for Latvia not to be left alone in this situation. We are being helped to overcome this difficult time not only by international financial organisations but also by the institutions of the European Union and by the nations of Europe. Latvia is grateful for this expression of solidarity.
Ladies and gentlemen, each enlargement has not only brought the European Union new Member States, but it has also introduced new accents into its agenda, including its foreign policy. Latvia's accession to the European Union took place at a time when Europe's Neighbourhood Policy, its goals, principles and implementation mechanisms, were being drawn up. Since that time, there has been a particular increase in the European Union's foreign policy activity towards its eastern neighbours. This has happened thanks to the engagement and experience of the new Member States. Latvia has always seen neighbourhood relations in a wider dimension. Latvia will continue to play an active part in the determination and implementation of this policy in the future.
This policy is not just a matter of the European Union's relations with particular states, that is, with those states with which it shares a land or maritime border. In the context of this policy, we must address the European Union's place and role in the world. Together with other like-minded nations, Latvia has actively encouraged a closer involvement by the European Union in its eastern neighbourhood region. A new political initiative, the 'Eastern Partnership' has come about, whose mission is to reshape Europe's common neighbourhood policy and adapt it to the specific characteristics of this region, thereby making this process more active, more courageous and more ambitious. Latvia notes with pleasure the European Commission's proposals in this regard. In its practical work, the Eastern Partnership must strengthen the political and economic relations between the European Union and the states in this region, and also strengthen the mutual cooperation between those states. In developing the Eastern Partnership, attention must be paid to the differentiation principle, individual assessment and the attitude towards each of the partners. Each of these states is following its own path of development. There are those states who wish to see themselves in the European Union, and there are those states that have chosen other goals for themselves. Our policy will succeed only if we are able to work together with all the states of this region, helping with understanding where necessary. I also received positive signals for extending and deepening cooperation on my visit to the Central Asian nations last October, when I visited Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Latvia will continue to be an active supporter of Europe's Neighbourhood Policy and play an active part in implementing it. Every European nation has its own experience of history and its own opportunities to work on our common project for the benefit of the European Union. Latvia's particular contribution to the eastern dimension is the mutual trust demonstrated by our bilateral relations, which are rooted in a shared period in history, and the expertise born out of that trust. Latvia's duty is to make use of this special circumstance which could be lost within the next 10 years. After several decades, to eastern eyes, Latvia will be only one of the Member States of the European Union, not the gateway to Europe. Making use of these advantages, Latvia will maintain an active political dialogue in order to encourage a better understanding of the European Union and its values in the neighbouring states and so clarify the goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. That is of mutual benefit, and we have an opportunity to hear how neighbouring states perceive their future relations with the European Union. I am convinced that Europe's interests would be best served by an early inauguration of the Eastern Partnership during the Czech Republic's Presidency.
Ladies and gentlemen, the question of energy security has very recently become topical during the first days of the Czech Presidency. The financial and economic crisis is cyclical in its own way. Questions associated with energy security and sustainable energy sources are, however, always on Europe's political agenda and that of the world. They are becoming more and more urgent. Energy security has a pronounced external dimension. This means that this question cannot be viewed divorced from the world situation. The recent events in Ukraine and the conflict in Georgia are proof of this. Even quite recently, European Union Member States regarded energy as an issue to be resolved at the national and not at the European Union level. The events of the last year in the energy sector, the interruptions to energy supply, the shrinking of energy resources and price volatility have helped to create a common understanding in European Union Member States of the need for a common energy policy. At the intersection of energy and politics, our main task is to secure a regular, sufficient, economic, sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply.
You have to admit that the European Union has had only mixed success in this sphere. On some issues, of which the development of an environmentally friendly energy economy is an example, we have adopted ambitious goals at the European level, which we must now begin to achieve. On other issues - diversification of energy sources at European level and creation of a single energy market - we are right at the beginning of our journey. The events of the last few days, involving a cut-off of gas supplies from Russia, has opened eyes to the need to find the quickest possible solution at pan-European level. All of us have the responsibility of applying this common understanding to create a truly integrated and diversified European energy market. We must not allow our resolve to vanish along with this spring's snow. The energy security question can only be successfully resolved by an active dialogue with the transit and supplier countries for energy resources. The European Union has the foreign policy instruments to resolve this issue. Our responsibility is to make use of them.
A further direction where we must make serious efforts is the integration of the Baltic energy market with the Scandinavian and Central European energy markets. Integration in the Baltic region is patchy. Trade and transport in the region are developing apace. The energy market, however, is stagnating. Here, the European Commission has done noteworthy work. Its initiative to improve energy security and solidarity also includes the development of the interconnection plan for the Baltic energy market. This will allow for a progressive integration of the Baltic States into the single European energy market. I hold Sweden's involvement in the strategic discussions on the Baltic Sea region in high regard. Sweden will shortly have the opportunity to put it into practice during its presidency in the second half of this year. I am convinced that strong regions from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea make for a strong European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, the initial aim of the European Union - the security and wellbeing of the people of Europe - has not altered. What has altered is the environment in which we must achieve this aim. The global economy is much more closely linked than it was half a century ago. At the same time, powerful new economic players have appeared on the world scene. It is only with coherent, far-sighted and, most important of all, common action by the European Union that we can hope not to be the losers in this global competitive struggle. Only together can we fulfil the promises of security and wellbeing for our citizens. Only thus can we attain the goal for which the people of our nations have cast their votes, in support of our participation in the European Union.
The European Parliament has already shown that it has a broad vision of the future of the European Union. This is especially true of its uniform and balanced approach to the Union's enlargement policy. Europe's dynamic growth has given Europe the opportunity to compete globally. This growth is Europe's potential, which it must exploit, so that the Union can, even several decades from now, be an equal economic partner for the rapidly growing Asian and Latin American economies. It is you yourselves in particular, as the democratically elected representatives of Europe's nations, who feel the responsibility for this process most acutely. It is also impossible to overestimate the significance of the European Parliament in bringing the European project nearer to our people and extending its democratic legitimacy. In the future, the role of the European Parliament will become even more important.
It is important to unite in our multiformity and diversity. It is important to continue working on improving the European Union. That is a task that all Europeans must take on together. That is our common responsibility towards Europe. It is essential to prevent fragmentation of the European Union. Member States must seek solutions and avoid the development of a multi-speed approach to the European project. The agreement reached in the Council last month for the furtherance of the Lisbon Treaty is welcome. The Lisbon Treaty is the legal precondition for the future fully effective functioning of the European Union. Only by putting the principles of the Lisbon Treaty into practice shall we be able fully to realise the positive potential that the new, united Europe offers. How effectively the Lisbon Treaty will work in practice depends on the political will of the Member States and institutions and their ability to unite in achieving Europe's goals.
Ladies and gentlemen, until 2004, Latvia's goal was membership of the European Union. Since that time, we have shaped Latvia's goals in the context of Europe's goals. We can no longer consider and perceive ourselves separately from Europe. We can define and achieve Latvia's goals only if they match Europe's common vision of the future. For their part, Europe's goals are attainable if they correspond to the vision of every Member State. The European Union was built and must be strengthened on a base of common values. Only public discussion can tease out those values that are common to all of us. Only in unison can we agree on those values that we are going to place alongside those on which the European Union was founded. It is the task of all politicians, but especially of Europe's leaders, to define European values and initiate discussion on them.
Let us look into the future. How do I see the European Union and Latvia in the longer term? In 2015, say? The post-crisis economic world will have coalesced into several economic power centres. One of them will be the European Union. Europe will have the will and the ability to be united, for only union will afford us the chance to fulfil our tasks. Moreover, the European Union will still be open to all those Europeans who accept its values. This unity in diversity will be the key to the growing importance of Europe's role in the world. The European Union will have expanded, but it will not lose the capability of effective action. The European Union will be able to look after its own security and provide for stability in its neighbours. Education and culture will be the bridge joining the different experiences of the European Union's Member States and that will help to regain Europe's leading role in the world in the realms of science and culture. There will no longer be old and new, small and large European nations. In Europe, nations will be judged according to their achievements, not by geographical and geopolitical criteria. Europe will be united, and this unity will be secured by powerful regions, which while defending their own interests will work closely together with others, thereby creating a network of wellbeing and development throughout Europe. Every nation will contribute to this development according to its own abilities and particular knowledge.
What will be Latvia's role in the European Union of 2015? That will be a time when Latvia will have emerged from the crisis. Latvia's capital city, Riga, will be one of the flourishing centres of the Baltic economic region. Latvia's economy will be more balanced, more competitive and structurally transformed. In 2015, for the first time in the history of the independent state, Latvia will be entrusted with solving questions on the European and global scale as the presiding Member State of the European Union. Our contribution to Europe will be our special relationships with the Eastern Partnership nations. Latvia and our region will be the bridge to the East, just as the Mediterranean states will join both shores of that sea. Our vision of an open Europe and our experience of integration will be the spur to Europe's openness.
Ladies and gentlemen, 2015 is not far away; only six years stand between us. A century ago, the Latvian poet Rainis wrote: 'What changes, endures'. Those are still wise words today. I am convinced that Europe will change materially. It will grow more powerful in its economy, welfare and mutual cooperation. It will consolidate its value system. Europeans will be proud that they live in Europe and yet belong to their own nation. Unity in diversity, development, preservation of values and every citizen's responsibility towards his or her nation and for the European family as a whole, that is Europe's future.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe's development and prosperity is the yardstick of our success. It is how our work will be judged. It is our responsibility. I call on you, as Members of the European Parliament, to encourage Europeans' understanding of our common goals and of how they will affect the life of every European in his or her own home. The support of European citizens for the idea of Europe is the strongest guarantee of Europe's future. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your work in this session. I wish you success in your further work and in the next European Parliament elections.
Mr President, my closing remark is this: you spoke about how you are learning and Latvia is learning. That is certainly true. Yet even those who belonged to the European Community, to the European Union, from the beginning are learning from you and your historical experiences. If we are prepared to listen to each other and to learn from each other, then we shall all be the better for it. On the basis of our common values, we are strong, democratic and free. Thank you, President Zatlers, it was a joy to welcome you here today. Thank you.
Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are discussing today is aimed at changing the regulations approved in 2004, which improved and harmonised the security regulations relating to the protection of EU citizens' passports and travel documents against fraudulent use, at the same time as it introduced elements of biometric identification. Contrary to the procedure in 2004, we are now in codecision. I want to thank the French Presidency and Commissioner Barrot for the enormous commitment they have made in this case with a view to reaching agreement at first reading. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their work and their cooperation, which have been indispensable in obtaining this result.
This solution was necessary, if we bear in mind that this regulation came into force in 2004, and as from June this year at the latest, all the Member States would have to collect the fingerprints of children from birth. However, according to the existing studies resulting from pilot projects conducted in several Member States, it is very difficult to take or even rely on fingerprints of children under six years of age. It is true that the national legislature could create derogations from this obligation. However, that would mean that up to the age limit for which that exemption was granted only temporary passports could be issued. It would be an excessive burden for parents to have to obtain a passport for each of their children whenever they wanted to travel outside the Schengen area.
We therefore succeeded in reaching an agreement stipulating a period of four years during which the age limit will be set at 12 years, with an escape clause which should allow those States which have already adopted legislation enshrining a lower limit to apply this, provided that limit is not lower than six years. A revision clause was also expected, taking into account the results of the study which we requested the Commission to carry out concerning the credibility of children's fingerprints, stipulating that the age limit will be definitively set and harmonised for all the Member States in four years' time.
We also reached agreement on two studies: one on the so-called 'breeder documents', to guarantee that the documents which enable passports to be issued deserve the same trust as the passport we want to safeguard, and another on data matching in border controls, in order to be able to study the false rejection rates. As a result of these studies, and bearing in mind the four-year revision clause, at some point the necessary changes should be introduced through a codecision procedure, without forgetting that it is important to consult the European Data Protection Supervisor, a rule which was unfortunately not taken into account when drafting this proposal.
I welcome the European Parliament's efforts to achieve an agreement on this proposal at first reading on the inclusion of fingerprints in passports issued by Member States by 28 June 2009 at the latest. Had an agreement not been found, everyone would have been obliged to provide fingerprints, including the new-born, whenever they travelled abroad with a passport. I, therefore, truly wish to express the Commission's satisfaction with the negotiated compromise proposal. Now the Commission will set about the task of the report requested and required by the European Parliament as efficiently as possible. I do not think I need to go on further. I will now listen with interest to the contributions from the Members and I again thank your rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, who has done an excellent job.
I believe there is an urgent need to create a common set of standards for the verification of biometric data. Colleagues may not be aware that at present there are wide discrepancies between countries as to how rigorously, for example, they verify passport photographs. Many countries require that the citizen applying for a passport actually present him or herself in person, together with their documents and photographs, and in these cases the officials at the passport-issuing office can see if that person bears a resemblance to the photo presented.
However, in some countries - maybe most notably in the United Kingdom - applications by post are the norm, and the authenticity of the photo is only confirmed by a so-called 'professional person' who has known the applicant for at least two years. The list of persons eligible to do this in the United Kingdom makes for fairly interesting reading. This verification can be made by your optician or your dentist, but also by a professional photographer or a fire service official - no disrespect to members of these professions.
Mr President, when the regulation on security features and the inclusion of biometric details in European passports was adopted in 2004, the Member States did not envisage any derogation from the obligation to provide fingerprints. Current experience shows that the existing technology still does not ensure that the fingerprints of children under the age of 12 are reliable enough to allow them to be used as a security feature in passports. I therefore welcome the compromise found with the Member States to set 12 as the age limit for the collection of biometric data, and which includes a clause for revision in three years. On our side, we have accepted this derogation for those Member States that have already adopted legislation for children over the age of six.
The use of this type of data would only be acceptable if it truly offered protection to our children. That is not yet the case. We remain, however, open to any positive changes in the technology in this field. Our priority is to ensure the safety of children travelling alone to avoid kidnapping and trafficking of children. The inclusion of this data in passports gives a false sense of security as it does not prevent a child from crossing a border without parental consent. The compromise found with the Member States will allow the Commission to present a report on the requirements for minors travelling alone across external borders. This report will thus allow initiatives to be proposed that will guarantee a European approach to the rules protecting minors when they cross external borders of the Member States.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, and the former French Presidency which, as expected, is not with us, for bringing about an agreement at first reading. It required the will to do it plus the ability to accept the compromise required. I have a special word of congratulation for Mr Coelho, our rapporteur, because his explanatory statement, which I invite my colleagues to read, is a little gem of intelligence and political skill.
Proper analysis of the text before us will reveal a major principle, which is also this report's revolutionary principle. This revolutionary principle has nothing to do with biometric data. That was decided in 2004. The principle is that of 'one person-one passport'. This raises the issue of children, and the age at which children's fingerprints can be taken. Let us not hide the fact that the compromise was extremely difficult. Some, like Mr Coelho at the outset, wanted this to be at the earliest possible age, to give children the earliest possible protection. Yet this would require reliable biometric data, which at the moment cannot be guaranteed. Finally, the following compromise has been achieved: children's fingerprints are obligatory from the age of 12. Those States that collect them earlier may continue to do so for four years, but in no case will the age limit be less than six and the Commission will, in coming years, report on an assessment of the system as it is operating and, if need be, and this is included in the text, any modifications. We must therefore hope for major progress in the technology, because the ideal for child protection would be to have reliable, comparable biometric data as soon as possible. With this in mind, we can register our agreement with this text, which I again welcome, and I congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission for its initial proposal and the Council for its sense of compromise.
The Verts/ALE Group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics until its necessity is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We believe that it has crucial implications for personal data safety and for fundamental rights. We voted against biometrics in visas. We are also against biometrics in European passports. We see the current proposal as a possible way of establishing limits for fingerprinting people for a travel document. Therefore, we are satisfied that the compromise with the Commission and the Council is achieved, the age limit of 12 years is established for those Member States where fingerprinting of children does not take place and the age limit of six years is established for other Member States.
I would like to stress once again that our support for age limits does not mean that we support fingerprinting as such. We strongly believe that biometrics in passports can be used only for verifying the authenticity of the document or the identity of the holder. Use of such data for other purposes, such as law enforcement, is neither legitimate nor proportional. We cannot agree that everyone holding the European passport is a usual suspect whose fingerprints are to be stored. That is our position, but I would like to stress once more than we congratulate Mr Coelho and the Commission and Council on this compromise.
Mr President, I am not in favour of taking fingerprints from small children or even tiny babies. Children must be exempted from the requirements to provide biometric fingerprints for passports. It is therefore right to create an exemption here for children. There is still no secure knowledge about the use of biometric fingerprints from children under the age of 12. The main ambiguity is how long fingerprints from growing children are in fact reliable. If we were simply to use these data, we might achieve the opposite of what we are trying to do, namely less instead of more security. It is therefore disproportionate to collect and use data whose reliability cannot be guaranteed beyond all doubt.
The compromise which has now been found with the Council reflects these concerns and, thanks to Parliament's insistence and thanks to the excellent work by the rapporteur, it is based on an age limit of 12 for a transitional period of four years, during which time a broad study will be carried out in order to investigate the reliability of children's biometric data. Unfortunately, the compromise also provides for exemptions for those Member States which already have laws allowing fingerprints to be taken from children under the age of 12. It is therefore even more important that we expressly establish during the course of the compromise reached that the European legal act on security features and biometric data in passports and travel documents cannot under any circumstances be used as grounds for appeal in order to set up databases containing these data at national level.
It is also of the utmost importance that we introduce a degree of harmonisation as regards the handling of biometric data, because a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. In theory, the abolition of internal borders in the European Union should have resulted in improved supervision of external borders, but in reality it is apparent that the system continues to exhibit quite glaring vulnerable spots. International criminal networks, drug and human traffickers and illegal immigrants have all benefited from such vulnerable spots. If we want a more efficient border supervision system, it is, in any case, high time that biometric data constituted an effective part of that system.
This principle should make it possible to offer greater protection against crimes such as child trafficking and child abduction, because every child should receive his or her own passport with a chip containing his or her biometric data. Of course, this will carry a price tag. This will certainly be the case in Member States which have until now allowed children to be included on their parents' passports. In the Netherlands, the maximum cost of a passport is upwards of EUR 48 and the cost of including a child on his or her parent's passport is EUR 8.50. For a family with three children this will, therefore, result in a doubling of the cost of obtaining passports, from EUR 120 at present to more than EUR 240. Of course, every parent would happily hand over that amount if it contributed to their child's safety. Yet is it not true that, if it is possible to abduct a child, it is also possible to get hold of his or her passport? Once the amended regulation is in place, it will no longer be possible to include children on their parents' passports. However, is it not the case that including a child on his or her parent's passport in some cases actually serves the very interest of the child's safety, as it indicates which parent has custody of the child? How will it then be possible to carry out effective checks of parental authority?
Within the next three years the European Commission will have to review the need for an additional regulation, for example Community rules concerning the crossing of borders by children. At present, Member States are still fairly divided on this issue. I call on the Commission to use the review to examine whether or not and how the introduction of a single passport per person has contributed to a decrease in the number of child abductions. Has the current compromise produced the desired effect or has it merely led to side effects which require resolution?
In view of the lack of appropriate tests connected with the use of new technologies, Member States should introduce their own requirements in the area of protection of citizens' rights. An age limit above which children have to be passport holders needs to be established, and also cases in which a single passport is issued to a holder and his or her children without biometric data should be eliminated. Situations of this kind may favour child trafficking, because checking the identity of the child is made difficult. In order to preclude this type of procedure, each person should hold his or her own passport.
However, all the Member States must understand in this respect that Frontex now needs to be upgraded in terms of funding and staffing so that it can actually perform its task really effectively. If there are no internal borders, the external borders must be protected accordingly. When hackers boast on the Internet about how easy it is to forge fingerprints on German registration records and point out that, if identity cards are reduced to credit card size, the photos are digitally cut to size, making biometric recognition more difficult, it is easy to start doubting this technology.
The use of passports by children according to the principle of 'one person-one passport' may be a fundamental means of winning this difficult and important battle. In my country, Portugal, collecting the fingerprints of children aged six years and upwards is already a long-standing practice, which is perhaps why I have no objection to it. As an upholder of the European cause, I believe that it is important to have harmonisation in this matter. It reassures me to know that the Member States which, like Portugal, long ago set six years as the minimum age for taking fingerprints will not have to change their national legislation.
However, I would like to hear what the Commission, in particular, or perhaps even my colleague Mr Coelho has to say about the question of what we should do when children travel alone, unaccompanied by their parents, as there is no uniform policy as regards which documentation they have to carry with them. The rapporteur's proposal is that the names of those with parental responsibility should be printed in the child's passport. However, sometimes, children travel accompanied by other family members and may, in fact, even live with them and so on. In short, we should be reasonably flexible in this regard.
On the other hand, I am concerned that no one has challenged the practicability of six-year-old children travelling unaccompanied. It might be possible by plane (let us not, at this juncture, discuss the possible traumas that the child - a six-year-old boy or girl - might experience on a plane), as the child could be accompanied onto the plane, met at the other end and chaperoned to one of his or her parents, for example, or to someone else. However, what arrangements would pertain when children travel by train, coach or other means of public transport? How would that be monitored? If there are parents who are irresponsible enough to send their children on such journeys, I think that we should take a more positive stance on this and say that children are not permitted to travel on their own at such a young age. That may, perhaps, sound somewhat harsh, but as much has already been said here on how precious children are and on the topic of kidnapping and so on, we should also make a bolder statement on this issue.
I would also like to ask the Commission how things stand with the joint statement of the Council and the European Parliament concerning the security of the original documents needed in order for a visa to be issued. This is because I am somewhat concerned that, if it is true, the system in a particular Member State might be allowing abuse to take place at the point of issue. I would put one final question to the Commission, or perhaps to Mr Coelho: what should we do when people arrive at a border, but the data in their passports does not correspond with that held in official databases? I think that we ought to include an instruction that benefits the child, or rather, the passenger.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of children a year fall victim to child traffickers and even more are abducted. A current study shows that it is unaccompanied minors who are the victims of such crimes. That is why we welcome the fact that the European Commission, in its amendments to the old regulation, now takes due account of children. When we demand that children too should have their biometric data in passports from a certain age, it is not due to mass hysteria, which I really do not share, but because we want to afford our children better protection. However, such protection can only be afforded if every child has its own passport with its biometric data and the names of its guardians.
As with all data collection, it is especially important to my group that the highest possible security is guaranteed when collecting, storing and processing the biometric data of all citizens and we must always be able to track who can access what data. The Council's regulations and decisions which affect this point make provision for very high protective mechanisms and control bodies to prevent data abuse. I have to say that I have fundamental confidence in my national authorities, unlike many private companies, some of which are able to pass unprotected data to third parties through scandalous security loopholes and receive due payment for doing so. That is precisely why it is so important for national authorities to capitalise on their established credibility and work closely with the data protection authorities. Contrary to what has happened here, this includes the European Commission honouring its legal obligations to consult European data protection officers.
(BG) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for the balance he has achieved in this report between ensuring a higher level of security for international travel documents and protecting the personal data and human integrity of the European Union's citizens. The suggestions made to improve a number of technical requirements will support the battle against cross-border crime, illegal immigration and human trafficking. For border countries like Bulgaria, which are exposed to intense pressure from migratory flows and the activities of international organised crime, the rapid and successful introduction of the new standards will be vitally important in terms of protecting the EU's external borders.
Unfortunately, in my country we have a few serious cases involving children who have disappeared, about whom there is still no information even now. This is why I feel that this report provides sound guidelines for the future development of standards for security features and biometrics in passports for Europe's youngest citizens. The introduction of the principle of 'one person-one passport' will provide them with an even higher level of security when travelling outside the territory of the European Union. The proposal to introduce additional information in the passports of children up to the age of 18 years will limit opportunities for the illegal activity of child trafficking. When it comes to applying the regulation within their national legislations, Member States obviously need to consider the possible financial repercussions for large families. This was also mentioned by some of our fellow Members who spoke previously. Freedom of movement must not be restricted for these families due to them having to pay a large amount of money for passports for their children.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and by saying that I endorse this report. I think the report is not only important, but also good. I will perhaps begin with the statement which has been made here that a passport is a document issued by Member States in accordance with national regulations. It is true that we have different passports, besides the covers, but it is important to find a balance between the security measures of these passports, so that they identify a citizen of the European Union or another person entering the territory of the European Union, and at the same time resist crime, much of which involves passports, such as illegal immigration, terrorism, child trafficking or forgery of documents. That balance has, I think, been found in this report. There are no indications that the restrictions which we are including in the report will in any way influence or restrict Member States in the issue of passports.
I want to draw attention to one principle which I fully endorse: the principle of 'one person-one passport'. In relation to children it is a good principle, but I would not like it to be a financial barrier to parents who want their children to have a passport, but whose financial means may be limited. I also want to draw attention to one weaker moment in the report, although the rapporteur has drawn attention to it, namely to the fact that modern, untried technologies need to be reassessed, and it is good that in three years' time we will be able to do this. I also call for the role of the European Data Protection Supervisor to nevertheless be taken into account. That EU institution must be more heavily involved in the whole procedure and it is for this which I call.
However, the crucial point is really in the new Article 3, which states that the purpose of biometric data is to verify not only the authenticity of the document but also the identity of the holder by means of directly available comparable features. At the moment, most countries rely almost exclusively on photographs and very few people, I would suggest - perhaps not even you, Mr President, nor even Mr Barroso - look like their passport photos - nor, indeed, would many of us want to! So I think that if there are new identity procedures and methods available, we should be prepared to use them.
As for Ms Gacek and Mr Batten and their anti-British, 'hit-and-run' contributions - because they are not here now to hear any response - I would suggest that the UK system is probably no better or no worse than many others in the European Union. We have checks and balances, but we can do better. If new 21st-century technology is available, then we should be prepared to make use of it and, as Ms Grabowska said a few moments ago, we should be prepared to amend it constantly to make the best possible use of what facilities are around the European Union.
I just wanted to raise a point for future reference. It is a fact that no biometric characteristic stays the same from childhood to adulthood except one: DNA finger-printing. This stays the same from conception to death and even beyond. It is possible today to identify someone even many years after his death by just obtaining some small specimen from the bone remains. DNA finger-printing technology today is quick, it is cheap and it can be carried out on just a few cells which can be obtained either from a quick mouth mucosal swab or from a drop of blood taken from, for example, the umbilical cord.
(DE) Mr President, my thanks go to Carlos Coelho, together with my congratulations on his report. We would have all been disappointed if his report had been below par, because we are already used to this standard of report from him. I particularly liked the fact that Carlos Coelho clearly pointed out from the beginning that his report was about the security of children. We can achieve this by issuing secure passports and by taking fingerprints to ensure that it is possible to check if the person crossing the border is actually the person shown in the passport.
This is therefore an objective which can be used to achieve security for children. That we are now discussing whether fingerprints should be taken at six years old or at twelve years old is a technical question, not a question of perspective. I would have no problem with taking fingerprints from the age of six, because this is all about children and their security. For me it goes without saying that data protection laws must be respected. We should not even be discussing that. It is the duty of a constitutional state to control that. If we achieve a situation in which we have secure passports and data protection laws are respected, then the European Union will have made a decisive step forwards in the interests of children and against child trafficking and child smuggling.
I would like to once again thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their collaboration, and that is not idle praise. It is fair to say that my colleague Mrs Roure played a crucial role in securing the agreement, to which Commissioner Barrot and the French Presidency also contributed a lot. I particularly wish to thank Commissioner Barrot for the Commission's readiness to give institutional backing to invigorating the fight against trafficking in children, as well as its readiness to collaborate in the three studies which we requested: on the reliability of children's fingerprints, on breeder documents and on false rejection rates, which are some of the concerns that we have in relation to the implementation of these rules.
Finally, Mr President, Mr Brejc raised an issue: he asked if we are able to say that the issuing of passports is secure. To be completely honest, I have to say that this varies from country to country. Some countries have more rigorous systems than others, and that is another reason why the study on breeder documents is very important. I know that Europe has no jurisdiction over this area - the issuing of passports is a national prerogative - and that is why I was very happy when Commissioner Barrot agreed to having the European Commission collaborate in this study on breeder documents. It makes no sense for us to have passports that are very secure if this security might be sabotaged during the issuing process. It is a case not of imposing measures on Member States, but of sharing best practices so that we can guarantee that the European passport is a secure reality on our external borders. Thank you very much to all of you for your collaboration.
Terrorist threats have made it necessary to introduce some additional security and biometric elements to increase the protection of passengers travelling within the European Union. The most important features in the proposal for a regulation are the fight against child trafficking by introducing the 'one person-one passport' principle and the introduction of derogations with regard to taking fingerprints from children under the age of 12. However, the legislation in some Member States allows for fingerprints to be provided by children under the age of 12, but this will only be possible for a transitional period of four years. There will, however, be an absolute age limit of six years. Some pilot studies carried out by Member States have highlighted that fingerprints provided by children under the age of six are not of good quality and can also change while they are growing. Setting an age limit reduces the risk of an error being made when identifying people by taking their fingerprints. It also makes the opportunity for child trafficking more difficult. The need to protect travellers has become even more evident in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001. However, an increase in the level of protection and security needs to be accompanied by a guarantee of passengers' rights and dignity, as stipulated by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The first is about the Council. European Union governments meet in the Council with law-making powers and, like any law-making assembly, they should be bound to make their work and their decisions public. I wish to emphasise this particularly because amendments have been tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for a split vote on certain paragraphs. I hope the split votes are not taken to delete significant portions of the report. For example, paragraph 3 of the report asks for action to be taken following the judgment in the case brought by Maurizio Turco, a former Radical Party MEP, who won a case in the Court of Justice over the publicising of legal decisions taken by the legal services of European institutions and also over the obligation to disclose the identity of Member State delegations to the Council. We are entitled to know who is voting in the Council and how. I therefore hope that no one will vote against this paragraph 3, or paragraph 9, which asks for information about what is happening within Coreper, the Committee of Permanent Representatives, and asks that they should disclose the meeting documents and not secrete all the international policy papers away as diplomatic documents. This is a very important point!
The other point we raise concerns Parliament, our Parliament, because we must be the first to publicise what we are doing. We Italian Radicals call it the 'public register of elected representatives', in other words a register where we can find out everything about the activities of MEPs, who is present, who is absent, how they vote and, of course, the money they are paid. Beware though, and I say this because an application has also been filed for a split vote on paragraph 5, it would be a mistake to think that if we keep some of this information confidential - I am addressing Mrs Cederschiöld, who I know is sensitive on this issue - we will really just succeed in leaving ourselves more exposed to aggressive, demagogic attacks on MEPs. We know that some fellow Members have filmed other MEPs, they have turned themselves into spies on other MEPs. The way to get around this is not merely to prevent it, but to publicise our work in full, foiling the people who want to peer through keyholes and opening our doors by broadcasting parliamentary committee work, meetings and all the proceedings of this Parliament over the Internet.
The third point I want to raise concerns document formats, because the PPE-DE Group has also requested a split vote on paragraph 7, concerning this point. In this paragraph we ask for documents to be created using open-source word processors, technologically speaking, as well as effective multilingualism and technologies that allow persons with disabilities to gain access to information and documents. I hope that no one in this Parliament is against open-source multilingual access using technologies that facilitate access by people with disabilities, because this is an essential aspect for a portion of European Union citizens.
The recommendation to merge Regulation 1049/2001 and Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 354/83 on the opening of the historical archives is quite complex for a particular reason, because Article 255 of the EC Treaty and Regulation 1049/2001 do not apply to all institutions and bodies. This might also change if and when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, because it will then extend the right of access to documents to all institutions and bodies. This is why it is not so easy to simply merge the two, because the coverage is different.
In the resolution you target the questions of document management and a common portal and the Trans-Jai project. The Commission supports the idea of setting up a common portal in order to facilitate access for citizens to legislative documents. I think this would entail a common methodology, and we have to look at all the practical consequences of that on document identification and references. We would like to see a portal that could entail the full availability of public documents for each institution, so we are willing to work together with you on that.
Let me also comment on the issue of exchange of information between the institutions. I understand what is meant there and what you are after, but I wish to remind you that between our institutions we already have an established working method with the exchange of confidential information held by the Commission and this is regulated in an annex to the framework agreement. We should also keep in mind that the question of sharing information between institutions is not related to public access and we think that this should be handled separately, as it is currently.
This report and the debate is also a valuable and appreciated input for another time when we can discuss it on a broader scale. I am grateful for Parliament's efforts to keep the issue of transparency and openness high on the EU agenda. We will come back to many of these questions in the very near future, for instance during the joint meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs with the Czech Parliament next week which I shall have the pleasure to attend, and then in just a couple of weeks we will be dealing with the important issue of revising Regulation 1049/2001.
I think the discussions should not end there. We need to be open about transparency and think also what we can do proactively outside the formal legislation, such as on improved registers, on greater user-friendliness and accessibility, active dissemination and quicker publication of documents. Something that I myself did last year was to make the register of my own correspondence directly accessible on the web. I am sure that you all have similar ideas and examples of what can be done if we just put our minds to it. So let us do that.
I would divide into four distinct groups the amendments that you have proposed - amendments that you have proposed to yourself, I would stress - in a report that received the support of all groups initially. Firstly, some are impossible; you make some suggestions that are impossible. For example, Mr Cappato, some of your suggestions have no legal basis as yet: until the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, it will be impossible to harmonise the rules of the different institutions. Commissioner Wallström has just said something similar. You also call for 2009 to be declared European Year of Transparency, but we are too late, there is no time. Some of your suggestions are therefore impossible.
Secondly, some of your suggestions are inadvisable. For example, you call for transparency in the meetings of the political groups. This would not do. There is a need for privacy, since privacy is a political asset. If I want to disagree with my party and to maintain my opposition, I want to do so in private: that is not a lack of transparency. There must be transparency within public bodies, but not within the parties, the privacy of whose debates must be guaranteed. I cannot, therefore, agree with you on this point.
Lastly - before the President signals to me, because I am already nearing the end of my time - some of your suggestions are unnecessary. For example, I understand that it is really wonderful and attractive to public opinion to speak of transparency in Members' activities, so that it can be seen whether they attend plenary sittings. It can already be seen, Mr Cappato. It can also be seen whether they attend the committees too; there are minutes for each of them, to which all citizens have access. The allowances that MEPs claim are also public. In other words, it is perfectly possible for citizens to gain access to this information.
The Regulation is about access to all of the documents held, received or produced by the three institutions when acting in its legislative capacity. That is what we need to get back to. We need to define what the 'legislative capacity' is. We need to look at how the Regulation has worked up until now and we have to improve it. That is what I want to do in conjunction with all the players, and I am pleased to welcome here the Swedish Minister, Cecilia Malmström, who worked originally on this. We all want to take the whole issue of access forward.
So, Marco, you have sadly gone wider than the remit, especially with this dream that you have. If you had not declared that you were an Italian radical I would never have known it from this report, but the fact that you expect political parties to broadcast their internal debates - it is not going to happen and indeed, as the previous speaker said, all you do is expose division rather than reinforce the fact that we are here because we believe in a Europe that is accountable to its citizens. That is why drawing up the voting list will be difficult. My heart is with you, but I have to follow my head.
One might accuse Mr Cappato, as Mr Herrero-Tejedor and Mr Cashman have done, of going beyond the remit. That is surely a matter of interpretation and in this case also not entirely justified. The discussion as to whether or not, in principle, the group meetings should be broadcast is surely something we can talk about. The question is, then, whether we would have the right, for example, to hold such a meeting in private at the request of the majority of the group members, as there are certainly sensitive issues - as we all know from our own meetings - that need to be clarified between ourselves before we can go public with them. In my opinion, it is normal to wash your dirty laundry at home and not out in the street.
Compared to either of the other institutions, Parliament can still be considered to lead the way when it comes to transparency and so I would not make it my top priority, since with regard to both the accessibility of documents and to the transparency of its sittings and the activities of the Members of the European Parliament, we are more open than any national parliament. That does not mean that there is no need for improvement, including in other institutions, particularly the Council, which, regrettably, is not here now. Mr Cashman has just said that we need to know who has made what decision and how in order to be able to establish accountability for political actions.
It is even more important, however, to provide access to documents produced within the framework of the comitology procedure, for example. A specific example is the Regulation on liquids in hand luggage, the annex to which was not accessible to citizens, and neither was it accessible to parliamentarians. The requirement for transparency has not been introduced in most Member States of the European Union without good reason, and that is to give the people the opportunity to understand the political activities, to be able to establish accountability and then perhaps also to enable different decisions to be made in elections.
Mr President, if the European Union is to be for the citizens, rather than for the Eurocrats, then it obviously must be more transparent, as must the activities of the European Union's bodies. Only then may the Union regain the credibility it has carelessly tossed aside. For example, its credibility has been damaged by attempts to push the Constitutional Treaty through and the failure to hold national referenda. That is why it is right to demand that all Council debates, as they decide the fate of Europe, should be accessible to the citizens of the Member States of the European Union. However, these debates do not include political group debates.
It is also important for Parliament, the Council and the European Commission to adopt the same principles for providing access to documents, so that they do not remain lone stars in the information and IT firmament. I think that this report is a significant step towards transparency. However, I firmly believe that, with regard to certain issues, it may be taking things a step too far. Even Comrade Lenin once said that we sometimes need to take two steps forward, in order to take that one step back. The rapporteur might want to bear this in mind.
Mr President, in a democracy, transparency is a concept of honour. In democratic countries, the citizens elect the governing authorities. These authorities appoint officials to implement democratic decisions. It would therefore be absurd for these elected representatives and appointed officials to be entitled to withhold information from their electorate. The fact that this happens nevertheless has two explanations. The first is a legacy from a pre-democratic society where the people were seen as subjects under non-elected rulers. The subjects were not permitted to interfere in the ruler's affairs. The second is that the nation's security, consideration of citizens' integrity, business secrets, market influence and similar considerations may require exceptions to transparency.
It is with a certain amount of pride that I note that my own country, Sweden, has the longest historical tradition of statutory transparency. That was why the Swedish state became involved in the Turco case and got the European Court of Justice to override the Council and the Court of First Instance last summer. This was yet another step away from the mandarin empire, but the road to establishing democratic transparency in the EU is a long one. There is a lot of internal resistance to quash. Mr Cappato's report should therefore receive the full support of this House, which would be yet another step forward along that long road.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am just going to speak for a few seconds to say that I agree with a good part of Mr Cappato's report. It would be surprising if I felt otherwise, because I believe I am the only Italian MEP who has tried to make public a list of attendances and the number of questions raised here in our Parliament by the Italian delegation. I have done this, year by year, in the small book in which I report on my parliamentary activities.
I would be happier if, for example, the Italian press, which all too often points its finger at us, would publish information that may not be earth-shattering in itself but would nevertheless serve to illustrate the type of activities that an Italian MEP carries out in this place. It would be all the better if it could serve to highlight how our actions, if properly performed, are independent of the political affiliations for which we have been elected, in the sense that we seek to be of service to the entire system.
When we speak of accountability and transparency, we must start with ourselves and that means all of the EU institutions. I agree with much of the report. I have one or two caveats. For example, we must ensure that, if we provide information on Members' activities, say, that such information is comprehensive. Otherwise we will end up knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing. By this I mean that our workload is really quite broad. It is not just attendance at committees or plenary. Any such information on Members' activities would need to include all the activities. Otherwise some very valuable work that is not concentrated in Parliament could be lost because it would be invisible.
(DE) Mr President, my experience is presumably very similar to that of millions of Europeans. Commissioner, I entered this Parliament in 1999 with a great deal of enthusiasm that was not inferior to the enthusiasm that you continue to display. Then I did what so many citizens do. I wanted to know something, and that was: how are decisions made? Where does the money go? Who receives it? More and more voters have come to me and said: we do not know where we are with this EU. This was also my experience. Unfortunately, one then realises that behind many measures there is a deliberate intention to conceal the irresponsibility that we still have in our institutions, including unclearly assigned legislature. I can only encourage you to keep to your convictions to go further than the Cappato report currently does and make this basic information available. That would be an achievement, and I say this after 10 years.
(PT) Mr President, Mrs Wallström, ladies and gentlemen, the transparency principle is a basic principle of the European Union. It reinforces the democratic nature of our institutions and facilitates the participation of the citizens in the decision-making process, so ensuring greater legitimacy for public authorities by making them more effective and answerable to the people. I support the principle that all democratic institutions have a duty to ensure that their activities, documents and decisions are made public. Access to documents is a fundamental element in the loyal cooperation that is necessary between the European institutions.
During the investigation into the activities of the CIA in Europe, I criticised the Council forcefully for violating this loyal cooperation by imposing restrictions - full and partial - on access to essential documents. That is why I also applauded the decision of the Court of Justice in relation to the Turco case, in which it concluded that there exists, in principle, an obligation to disclose the opinions of the Council's Legal Service relating to a legislative process; those opinions could be crucial to understanding the direction that the decision-making process took.
(PL) Mr President, civil rights include the right to information concerning the activities of representatives, elected by society, who fulfil important public functions. This is particularly true in the case of the European Union institutions, including the Council, whose documents are more difficult to access. Information programmes available on the Internet should be user-friendly and easily guide the interested person to the document for which they are searching. However, although many people have Internet access these days, not everyone does. We need publications that can be accessed in libraries and summaries that are more accessible to people who are not as comfortable reading texts. However, we need to consider whether the full transcripts of political group discussions should be published.
(PL) Mr President, assuming that democratic systems, based on the rule of law, should be bound to publish provisions which are binding for their citizens, we should ensure that the activities of the institutions are transparent and open. In practice, the meetings and debates of democratic legislative bodies, as well as their votes, should, where possible, be transparent and draft legislation should be accessible to the public. Unfortunately, the Council often operates in a way which makes it difficult to relate a document to a procedure, which then makes it impossible for citizens to access these documents.
Mr President, I noted carefully what the rapporteur said. There are two categories involved here: access to information on EU legislative work, and access to documents in the non-legislative field. In relation to the former, I support what is being called active transparency to the point of freedom of information as the norm and, indeed, very reduced use of secret meetings and room documents at Council level. I think we should know how our Ministers vote so that they can be held to account to stop this 'blame Brussels' culture that goes on in national parliaments at home. I should also like easy access to MEPs' records of attendance and voting during parliamentary work at all levels.
Let us take a look at what happens when the tables are turned and the public administrator wants to find out what we citizens are doing. We cannot have any secrets: in some of our Member States, private telephone calls are even intercepted between husband and wife, between parents and children and so on. We must absolutely not fear citizens knowing exactly how laws are made and decisions are arrived at in the Commission or in the Council, and that also applies to the legislative decisions made by our Parliament. I welcome this initiative.
(PL) Clarity and transparency should form the basis of the activities of the European Union's institutions. Only if we achieve a suitable level of transparency will our activities become more comprehensible to the citizens, and therefore closer to them. The institutional crisis facing the Union demonstrates to us all the consequences of adopting the wrong approach to this issue. In my opinion, it was precisely this dismissive attitude towards the citizens of the European Union which resulted in the institutional reforms turning into a fiasco and the failure to ratify the Lisbon Treaty in France, the Netherlands and Ireland.
We should, therefore, draw the correct conclusions and be aware that social acceptance of the European Union's activities should be our basic priority. In order to achieve this acceptance, the citizens should be aware of what we do, how we operate and, ultimately, what decisions we take. We need a clear, cohesive and legible source of information on the activities of all the European Union institutions. The European Parliament's place is certainly at the forefront of this change, as it is the institution that is closest to the citizens of the European Union. We should remember that the Union was created for these very citizens.
We are still carrying a burden of historical differences in culture and views on what should be made public or not. I think we are still struggling with that in some cases. I come from a country where we have a very long tradition of the principle of openness and access to documents, while in other Member States it has been the opposite: It is first secret and only the things you decide should not be secret should be made public. I think this is still something that we have to try to tackle and deal with. I think that the report has also shown all the linkages and the interlinkages between all these issues and we have to look at it from a political point of view.
I hope you know that you can count on me to continue, on a daily basis, to strive to make sure that the Commission improves its access to documents. We can look at what we do in the committees; we can improve what we do on registers and on a number of points that Mr Cappato has raised and that are helpful to us. I think you should keep up the pressure on the Commission, but you have also shown that it concerns Parliament as well. You can also improve and add to openness and transparency. This is certainly a part of strengthening democracy in Europe. We will have the chance to do some work on this during preparations for the EP elections. That would be one of the ultimate tests for all of us.
I am talking here about greater and easier availability of information; of course, this does not mean that groups would no longer be able to hold meetings behind closed doors. I am not talking about an absolute and ideological obligation applying to any meeting, but about ensuring that the infrastructure is in place if we want it. I do not believe it to be true, as Mr Herrero said, that information on attendances, votes and so on is fully kept and fully available. That is not true. Minutes are available for individual committees and the information can only be put together by conducting a meeting-by-meeting investigation.
I am well aware that the worth of an MEP's work does not lie solely in attendances and absences, but I cannot understand the reason why we ourselves should half conceal this information, opening the door to the worst and most demagogic kinds of manipulation. I therefore hope that on these aspects and on the aspect of access to data by disabled people - I cannot imagine why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has asked for a separate vote on this - I really hope that we do not have any last-minute surprises because I think this is a matter of fundamental importance for everyone. Mr President, thank you for your understanding.
What we are discussing is dichloromethane (DCM), a paint stripper. It is also an industrial chemical that is actually used a lot in the pharmaceutical industry. In its industrial application, however, it is entirely possible to protect workers and the environment when using this chemical. It is predominantly when it is sold to consumers that there are problems. DCM is a noxious chemical in that it is carcinogenic, has a narcotic effect and has harmful effects on health. It is easy to be affected by it. By the time you smell DCM, you have already exceeded the safety limit by a factor of three, which makes it extremely difficult to protect yourself against. A proper protective set-up consists of very high-spec gloves that have to be changed every three hours. You have to have equipment that usually costs around EUR 2 700 with an independent ventilation system.
The fact that this chemical is used today is very much dependent on the fact that it is used illegally. This meant that it was also important to restrict and prohibit use by professional users. It is often the self-employed and companies consisting of just a few staff who are out there cleaning up graffiti or stripping paint. The protective equipment is very often left at home or just not available at all. Banning this chemical is therefore, to a very large extent, a worker-protection issue. We know that, in those countries where it is used - which means 24 of the 27 Member States at present - DCM is hardly ever used properly in accordance with national and European legislation. I think it will suffice to quote the German Chemical Industry Association's own text, which states that even if there is good ventilation, paints are stripped in restricted areas, the paint residues removed are collected and the DCM pots closed immediately, the exposure limit is still exceeded on a regular basis. That is why self-contained breathing equipment is needed.
I think that it is very positive that the Commission put forward a proposal and that we have now reached a compromise that will, in practice, also prohibit professional use, with countries having the ability to obtain national derogations. However, those who obtain such derogations must guarantee that those who work with this chemical have suitable protective equipment, adequate training and awareness of the alternatives and they must be able to justify why they are unable to make use of these alternatives. It is, in fact, the case that there are functional alternatives available in all the areas in which dichloromethane is currently used. We are talking about the 5% that is used in the dangerous way, which is to say for paint stripping. The other 95% of the volume of DCM used is used within industry. It is a good thing that we are tightening up the protection of workers and the environment there, too.
All in all, I am, in fact, very satisfied with the agreement. It will improve people's ability to strip paint safely without being exposed to dangerous, carcinogenic chemicals. My fellow Members of this House have helped to make it possible to achieve this agreement so quickly, and I thank you all for that and for all the shadow rapporteurs and myself being able to reach agreement with the Council. This bodes well. This was, in fact, the last chance before REACH to ban chemicals in the old-fashioned way. It was therefore a type of grand finale for the old style of chemicals policy and it was certainly a good finale for us to reach agreement so efficiently.
In respect of DCM, there are those who argue that the alternatives may possibly be at least as dangerous, if not more so, but the assessments by the Commission and others have clearly shown that the alternatives are significantly less dangerous. We are now creating a market for the alternatives. The reality is that those companies that are currently grumbling will, in many cases, also manufacture the alternatives, while there are also smaller companies that manufacture alternatives. It is a good thing that they will now get the chance to exploit their competitive advantage of greater environmental protection in the internal market. We are heading for a safer future, and I thank everyone who has been involved in the process.
The marketing and use of dichloromethane by professionals will be subject to a general ban. However, as some Member States believe that it is essential for professionals to continue using this substance in future, these Member States will be given the option of permitting its use under specific strict conditions. These Member States must impose specific rules and regulations for authorising professionals which fit into their existing national systems. Professional users will only be granted authorisation after they have completed a training course. The training course must, among other things, provide information about the risks of dichloromethane and the availability of alternative substances. Employers and self-employed people should preferably replace dichloromethane with other substances or procedures, taking into account the relevant workplace safety legislation.
The use of paint strippers containing dichloromethane will continue to be permitted on commercial premises, provided that all the necessary measures have been taken to keep the exposure of the people working there to a minimum. For example, it is essential to ensure that there is adequate ventilation in order to remain as far as possible within workplace limits. Measures to minimise evaporation from containers of paint stripper must also be put in place. In addition, protective respiratory equipment must be worn when the workplace limits are exceeded.
Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and reiterate that we have worked very well together to reach this compromise, which has the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Attention must be drawn to the fact that this is a highly toxic product and that viable and safe alternative solutions do exist. Indeed, we cannot deny the hazards - as you mentioned, Mr Verheugen - associated with the use of dichloromethane, particularly if the conditions do not guarantee user safety. Often dichloromethane is used by individuals carrying out restoration work in their own homes. They find it to be an excellent and effective product, but do not realise that by using it in an enclosed space they risk losing consciousness very quickly, and that there is even a risk of death if due care is not taken.
Contrary to the extreme position of a total ban, as first proposed by the rapporteur, the compromise we have reached now leaves Member States the option of providing an exception for professional and industrial use, but under clearly defined conditions. This is a valid compromise and it is important to recognise that dichloromethane is responsible for many accidents. I regret, moreover, that we have very little information on the accidents at work that have happened. I would also point out that an impact assessment was performed before the Commission's work began and that its findings shaped the text. We must nonetheless ensure that very specific information is available to those individuals who may still be tempted to use this product, even though it is the Member States that are now responsible for drawing up clear rules and enforcing the general marketing ban on this product that is hazardous to health.
Dichloromethanes, as we have heard, are substances with a uniquely hazardous profile. They are so volatile that inhalation, even just the casual smell of them, is above all recognised health limits. They are carcinogenic and they cause neurotic effects with nerve damage. Under normal temperatures their use causes them to evaporate to dangerous levels. To work safely with dichloromethanes one needs an air-proof suit at a cost of about EUR 2 000, and to protect one's skin, gloves at a cost of EUR 25 or EUR 30, which need to be replaced every two or three hours.
Of course nobody does this, even if they know of the harmful nature of the substance. There is no effective way to ensure the safe use of dichloromethanes for the public. And, because they are so toxic, the rapporteur and the committee wanted to ban them, even for professional use, in order to prevent fatalities. Over the last eight years the Commission has on record some 18 fatalities from the use of these products and some 56 non-fatal injuries. I am sure that in reality there have been more. But there has been an industrial lobby which has created a blocking minority in Council, and for that reason the rapporteur and the committee reluctantly agreed to allow the Member States a derogation for professional use.
I mentioned that I have a constituency interest in this. I have been in correspondence with Commissioner Verheugen for seven years now on this issue. Why? Because I have in my constituency a company called Eco Solutions, which has developed a perfectly safe alternative to dichloromethanes. It is a water-based alternative. It has the same effect even if the process takes a little longer. I am sorry to say that the only Member State lobbying hard for the retention of dichloromethane use was the United Kingdom, which also produces in industrial quantities many such substances.
It took me four years' work with Commissioner Verheugen to get the Commission's expert committee even to look at the existence of this safer water-based alternative, and it has taken three years to get that water-based alternative recognised as an effective and useable technology. But I am pleased to say that, as with all the best stories, this one has a happy ending. Dichloromethanes will come off the market for non-industrial use. My constituents will become richer with their new technology, and everybody will live happily ever after thanks to the excellent work of Carl Schlyter and his colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Unfortunately, workers in the pharmaceutical industry and those working on cleaning up walls and façades will continue to run the risk of suffering the effects of dichloromethane. This agreement will not, I am sad to say, mean a total ban on the professional use of DCM. This is a serious failing, and one that I hold the Commission entirely responsible for. This derogation, however, has been framed in such a way that what I hope is the small number of Member States that want to use DCM must guarantee that their workers do not suffer as a result. The burden of proof is thus on those countries that want to engage in the limited use of DCM, which must prove that the substance will be used in the safest possible manner and guarantee the protection of workers. In the end, this is quite acceptable.
By and large, this is a good agreement. I would like to urge the Commission to draw inspiration from this decision. Yes, we can! Let us now go further. I urge the Commission, please, is it not possible for you to give us an indication that, in the future, there will be more bans on hazardous substances such as carcinogenic azo dyes, bisphenol A and the flame retardant deca-BDE? If the EU cannot do this, why can you not permit individual Member States to go further and introduce their own bans? You, in the Commission, even go so far as to force the Member States to lift restrictions that they sometimes already have. My own country, Sweden, for example, was forced to allow azo dyes after joining the EU in 1995. Following threats from the Commission about legal action in the European Court of Justice, Sweden has now begun to permit deca-BDE. That is unacceptable and, more than anything, it is not environmentally friendly. That is not the way to conduct a progressive programme of environmental legislation. Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, please do convince me otherwise! Prove that environmental considerations take priority over the demands of the market in more cases than this single example.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, dichloromethane, which is available on the market and is authorised for common use in the shape of various commercial products, is also widely used in the chemical industry, as well as the textile and pharmaceutical industries. Dichloromethane is easily absorbed by the human body, it is highly toxic and carcinogenic, and is responsible for many cases of poisoning, including fatal accidents. In Poland alone, the number of people exposed to this chemical agent in the workplace is estimated to stand at several thousand. While industrial use of the chemical can be effectively controlled, the use of dichloromethane by individual consumers, or even by professional companies, is inevitably associated with a risk to human health and life, not only due to the fact that there is no way of implementing proper controls, but also due to the high cost of implementing protective measures.
All warnings and measures to regulate the use of dichloromethane have proved to be ineffective, in view of the high toxicity and the volatility of this chemical compound, which is why it is necessary to completely withdraw dichloromethane from widespread consumer use. Economic factors should not be used as a reason for maintaining this poison in common use. We must also avoid using the interests of industries which manufacture products containing DCM as an argument to support restricted consumer use of dichloromethane. As far as the common usage of this compound is concerned, the cost to society far outweighs any material benefits.
It has been a hard road to get to this. Originally the Commission came forward with a proposal to ban this substance for individual use - not for professional use - and the rapporteur brought forward these proposals to extend this to professional use. And so we listened to the evidence of our constituents, as Graham Watson has done. He has talked about industrial lobbies. He has also referred to an industrial lobby in his constituency, which successfully persuaded him of the alternative. We know that 90% of paint strippers use DCM, so we had to look at the balance of this.
I think that this, among many other substances, poses a high risk. It is potentially hazardous. There is evidence that there have been accidents and people have been hurt. It is probably right that we take stronger action than has been taken in the past. That is why I accept and genuinely welcome the compromise that is being sought. It leaves the door open to Member States that wish to, and believe it is right to, continue under the tight rules that have been laid down to allow professionals - and only professionals - to use this in addition to industrial use.
But, Commissioner, you now have a responsibility to go back and do the research on the alternatives. Look at the alternatives that are available: NMP has been available for 11 years, but only now is found to be reprotoxic; there are flammable solvents that can cause glue-sniffing problems; there are date-rape drug substances that are seen as safe alternatives; there is DBE, about which not much is known; and there are the more basic blowlamps and sanding methods that can be used, although dust and other problems arise there. So let us now go back and thoroughly investigate the alternatives so that we really can be sure that we are providing a safer alternative for our constituents. If we find that some of the alternatives are no less dangerous, then I am sure the Commissioner or his successors will be back to tell us so and to bring forward a proposal - and if they do not I am sure Carl Schlyter will.
(CS) Madam President, dichloromethane has narcotic effects causing damage to the central nervous system and loss of consciousness, as well as cardiotoxic effects. If it is misused there is a direct risk of death and this factor has implications for terrorism. I therefore support a ban on its use by ordinary consumers and strict restrictions on professional use. As alternative and possibly less toxic bleaching substances exist, then in my opinion it is unnecessary to permit exceptions. However, the proposal we will vote on tomorrow will allow Member States to apply to the Commission for exceptions in justifiable cases, although under very strict conditions. I would like to know how the Commission or anyone else will assess the validity of applications for exceptions and how they will monitor compliance with the restrictions.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying a few words to Mr Watson. You have played an important role in bringing about this proposal. At the time when you told me in person about the problem which you had had for several years with the Commission, I realised that there were alternatives to this substance and I am sure you will agree that from then on things moved very quickly. I personally instructed my Directorate-General to present the proposal because it was clear to me as a result of my dealings with you that there were alternatives. I have stated on another occasion in this Parliament, and I would ask Mr Holm in particular to listen to this, that although I am the Commissioner with responsibility for enterprise and industry, I do not believe that an industrial product which is hazardous should remain on the market simply so that it can be used to earn money. I am of the opinion that, when there is an alternative which can replace a hazardous industrial product, it should be replaced. This is the principle which I have adhered to when we discussed and adopted REACH in this Parliament. All the substances which you referred to, Mr Holm, are now governed by REACH.
I would also like to make it clear, Mr Holm, that I would also have voted in favour of a more far-reaching compromise. If Parliament had been able to agree with the Council on banning the commercial use of dichloromethane, I would have voted in favour this evening. Please do not hold the Commission responsible for the fact that there are several Member States who did not want to take this further for reasons which I am not familiar with. This is the reason why the Commission presented its proposal in the way that it did, because we wanted to produce a proposal which had a chance of being accepted and this is now what has happened.
As I am responsible for monitoring the notification of these differing regulations, I can tell you that the Commission acts on the basis of a clear and unambiguous principle in this case. We take the healthcare-related and environmental arguments of the Member States seriously. If they enact different regulations for these reasons, we do not force them to revoke their environmental and health regulations. If you have any information from recent years to back up your accusation, I would like to find out more specific details, so that I can refute your claim. The case that you mentioned dates back to 1995, which means that I had nothing to do with it.
I can only conclude this debate by appealing to the Commission to ensure, now, that those Member States which apply for a derogation for professional use have that derogation revoked if these new, stricter rules are regularly broken. We know, everybody knows, and all the studies show that, if dichloromethane is used correctly in such a way that the health of the workers involved is protected, this substance is both uneconomical and unecological. If DCM is allowed to behave according to proper market conditions, which is to say if the legislation is complied with, its own uncompetitiveness will very quickly mean that DCM will be completely abandoned to be replaced by the alternatives. I will take this opportunity to appeal to the Commission to ensure that the regulations are complied with. If this is done, DCM will phase itself out sufficiently quickly.
With today's decision, the European Parliament is significantly restricting the use of the paint stripper known as dichloromethane. As the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I welcome the decision, into which we have put a lot of work. In recent years there have been many fatalities as a consequence of dichloromethane use. This extremely volatile substance is damaging to the nervous system, and for the same reason is also carcinogenic. The victims were primarily individual users, those decorating their own homes and house decorators, since in industrial use certain safety regulations are observed. The concentrations measured in certain European industrial plants were so high that - in case of prolonged exposure - they would cause cancer in 10% of the workers.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, fishing is by nature the most globalised of professions and one that confronts globalisation in all its might. An estimated 30 million people work in this field and these people are exposed to significant hardships and dangers quite apart from the effects of globalisation. According to statistics from the International Labour Organization, a comparison of the number of fatal accidents in the fishing industry with the number of fatal accidents at work generally shows that fishing is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.
All European institutions support the generally recognised Programme for Decent Work. The Commission recently reinforced its commitment through the renewed social agenda and a report linked to the Communication on decent work of 2006. An important part of the Commission's approach is its support for international work standards. A general improvement in safety conditions, medical care and legal protection in the area of fishing together with levels of social protection closer to those enjoyed by other workers can be achieved only if efforts are made to establish minimum standards on a global level. As members of the International Labour Organization and with the support of the Commission, the EU Member States have contributed as much as possible to creating an updated and purposeful Convention through which these international minimum standards will be established. These can be supplemented with mechanisms for ensuring harmony and mechanisms for enforcement such as inspections in foreign ports subject to certain conditions. In June 2007 the Convention and the non-legally binding recommendation were adopted by the governing body of the International Labour Organization.
Convention 188 revises several older standards of the International Labour Organization relating to fishermen and, when it comes into force, it can create equal and improved conditions for all. The Convention regulates matters such as minimum age, medical examinations, the location of the crew, rest periods, employment contracts, repatriation, the recruitment and location of workers, pay, food and accommodation, medical care and social security. Some parts of the new Convention relate to coordinating social security and this is an area exclusively under the Community's competence. The Council must therefore permit the Member States to ratify these parts of the Convention. The areas of shared competence also cover several other themes. As the new standards of the International Labour Organization must take effect as soon as possible, the Commission is proposing that the Convention include a challenge to Member States to try and speed up submission of their ratification documents and to submit them if possible no later than 21 December 2012. This challenge will be supported by a review of the ratification situation performed by the Council before January 2012.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we know and as someone has said this evening, the International Labour Organization considers the fisheries sector to be one of the most dangerous working environments. The number of fatalities each year amounts to approximately 24 000, and this gives an idea of the size of the problem. This sector therefore requires wide-ranging regulations and far-reaching international laws, able to ensure the appropriate safeguarding of the living and working conditions of fishermen throughout the world, who are often exposed to situations of harsh exploitation.
As a former Minister for Social Welfare in Ireland it was my task to try and find a way in which the rights of people working on fishing boats could be respected. It is an extremely complex area, where the issue is whether one is working under a 'contract of work' or a 'contract for work' - the difference being between those who are working as a normal employee for tax purposes and thus pay their social contributions to the skipper who is an employer, and those who share the proceeds of the catch, who are not treated as normal employees. The difficulties in reconciling those positions are extremely complex. As a Minister I managed to find a piece of European legislation which resolved the problem for a short period, but unfortunately it was subsequently challenged and found not to apply precisely to the issues at stake.
Fishermen out of work in Ireland are denied social welfare payments and this creates great hardship. Therefore, if ratification will achieve a significant decrease in fishing fatalities, ensure social security benefits for fishermen and social benefits, like medical care and the dole, then I welcome it and encourage its ratification. If it further promotes fishing as a viable industry for the small and medium operator, especially family-owned fishing boats, then I certainly can support it, because, as it is, fishing is dangerous and in many parts of the world exploitive - not just of fish, but also of people. Can it, and will it? I hope so.
(FR) Madam President, the sustainable management of fishing means regulating fishing efforts, of course, but it should also take account of fishermen's efforts. Fishing, as everyone agrees, and above all offshore fishing and deep-sea fishing, is the hardest job in the world, even if we are no longer in the era of the fishing conditions of the Basques and Icelanders of the 19th century, who embarked on long campaigns. It remains a very tough profession and worthy of respect, with 24 000 deaths every year.
Fishing is the perfect example of global activity due to the globalisation of the resource, namely the fish, which have no regard for national borders; therefore international laws are the only appropriate response. Since fishermen's work must be regulated internationally, the legislator is, of course, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and we are currently celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first ILO fishing conventions, on the minimum age, employment controls, medical examinations and accommodation. Today's convention, Convention 188, will thus amend, supplement and revise the previous conventions. This must all be ratified as soon as possible, before 2012. It is a fine example of joint management of jointly owned global resources by joint parties, and it is urgent, since the sea professions - dockers, fishermen, sailors - in today's globalised economic competition, are exposed to all manner of abuse, exploitation and trafficking, even cases of slavery, in the name of cutting costs, obviously.
(EL) Madam President, I think that this evening's debate is very important because, with the consent of the European Parliament, with the resolution that I imagine we are going to unanimously support tomorrow, we shall again give momentum to the implementation of the decent work agenda which we all supported last year. Convention 188 is nothing more than a part of the application of this agenda to the fisheries sector, which was not covered by the standard contract on seafaring work and, as previous speakers said, it is very important that we also have a minimum coverage at global level in this sector too.
(CS) Commissioner, like my fellow MEPs I consider it necessary to adopt standards that will ensure decent working conditions for employees in the fishing industry. It is not possible for the European Union in the 21st century to allow conditions similar to slave labour in any branch of work. I appreciate the fact that the proposed amendments were adopted in a tripartite format where governments, employers and employees drew up a comprehensive international work standard which takes account of the specific nature of this industry. It is on the plus side that the new arrangement determines a minimum age, medical examinations, rest periods and social security and that it is also concerned with living quarters, food, safety and health protection at work. All of these elements will undoubtedly lead to decent working conditions for fishermen while reducing injuries and deaths. Even though I represent a country that has no sea I welcome this standard, I support the fishermen and I wish them the quickest possible ratification of this Convention and not just because I enjoy fish.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me the pleasure of noting down the arguments expressed in the debate as they emphasised, from a very wide range of viewpoints, the importance of the debated Convention. They also emphasise, from a similarly wide range of viewpoints and through profound arguments, its importance to the everyday lives of fishermen, who number almost 30 million, as I mentioned in my introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion the formal process for this proposal is clear. Our subsequent political efforts must be directed towards achieving ratification as quickly as possible because the deadline set out in the Commission's proposal is the latest possible deadline and any reduction in the time taken would, in my view, be a good thing. I would like once again to thank the rapporteur Ilda Figueiredo for the work she has done and to thank all MEPs for the support they have shown for this proposal.
- (CS) I consider it necessary to add biometrics to the security features of travel documents. However, in addition to improving the security of European citizens, which is our primary objective, we must also consider the reverse side of the coin, which is protecting the privacy of our citizens. I will strive to ensure that the implementation of this legislation and application at a national level does not lead to bureaucratic difficulties, or even the misuse of data, and that includes misuse by third countries outside the EU. I would like to point out the need to promote greater involvement from Europol and Frontex in this matter; only a high degree of cooperation between the law enforcement authorities of the Member States will produce the desired effect of making Europe a safe home for us all. I am glad that children from the age of 12 years will have their own passport. This measure will reduce child abuse by organised criminals across borders, which is another reason why I support this apparently controversial topic.
But what concerns me even more is that in my country it will be the second time during the last ten years that new personal identity documents have been introduced. On a personal note, it will actually be the third time in ten years that I have had personal identity documents issued. You might find this amusing, but in Bulgaria people are on such low incomes that the additional burden on their resources which they have to spend on buying new personal identity documents is simply unethical and immoral for these people. When we are talking about pensioners who receive BGN 100, which is equivalent to a pension of EUR 50, it is not right to charge them EUR 20 to have new personal identity documents issued to them. This is why I voted against the Coelho report, because I feel that it is highly inappropriate for my country.
There are people who do not participate in this Parliament, in its committees or in its plenary. Some of them are members of small groups. They come in here and get speaking time before they rush off to the airport and spend their time in our national Member States, instead of being out here, telling people how awful democracy is in the European Union. Well, democracy is awful in the European Union if Members of this Parliament who do not turn up here can be paid a salary to continue with this sort of flagrant abuse of democracy. I want to put that on the record, Mr President.
- (CS) The European arms market operates inefficiently because it is fragmented. Today we have created a space for public procurement in this sector while respecting the exemptions for strategic reasons under Article 273 of the Treaty of Establishment. On the Committee, I have worked to end the waste of public funds brought about by opaque military contracts. In the past, the national interest clause was also abused in the case of public contracts for the army which clearly had nothing to do with the quality of security provided. I could name, off the top of my head, works contracts, catering and transport services. This proposal will save money that can subsequently be invested in research and technology to protect us more effectively against present and future threats.
The European Union is now facing very serious problems, such as the financial crisis and the energy crisis caused by the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. This is a period when we should act together and avoid any moves that might undermine our unity. The consequences of the crises will undoubtedly affect every citizen of the European Union, whether Slovak, Pole, Hungarian or German. I consider the attempts to provoke quarrels between Member States, which periodically crop up in our sessions, to be a sign of ignorance of the current serious situation where EU unity is under threat. We should concentrate more on finding solutions and on ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon in order to boost the competitiveness of the European Union.
- (CS) Mr President, I also voted against the adoption of this report from a Communist MEP on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union. Nevertheless, I appreciate the fact that rapporteurs from other factions have managed to edit the text a little and that it contains some good paragraphs on the situation of minorities. Some passages, however, are not objective. In addition, the extent to which the report oversteps the bounds for a document mapping a past period is unprecedented. The report assumes an overly one-sided political view of human rights in the Union. The report tramples on subsidiarity by dictating rules on family policy and other ethical issues, which is contrary to the founding treaties.
(MT) I also voted against Catania's report, because it contains at least three references to abortion as a human right. This is something that I do not agree with and find unacceptable. It is a pity that an important report such as this one that covers such a vast range of subjects had to incorporate elements within it that are doubtlessly beyond the competence of the European Union, and that the European Union cannot and should not try to interfere with; namely due to the subsidiarity principle. This is why I voted against Catania's report.
(NL) Mr President, in my career in this Parliament, I have rarely seen such a catalogue of politically correct nonsense and so-called progressive platitudes as in the Catania report. What takes the biscuit, though, is the fact that a report on so-called fundamental rights is de facto based on the Treaty of Lisbon, a treaty that was rejected in referendums, no less, and has currently no legal basis whatsoever. What arrogance! I wonder if fundamental rights might perhaps not apply to the European citizens, but only apply to the eurocracy.
(NL) Mr President, the right to the free expression of opinion and the way in which this right can be exercised is without a doubt a key indicator for assessing our fundamental rights situation. The report is quite right to warn against the non-official censorship and self-censorship that come about when certain topics are excluded from the public debate. Just as justified is the section in the report that warns against individuals and groups who want to silence others by claiming that they are being permanently attacked, undeservedly so.
What is totally mystifying, though, is the call to 'resolutely prosecute any hate speech in racist media programmes and articles spreading intolerant views'. This is exactly the kind of thing that leads to the censorship and self-censorship that are lamented elsewhere in the report. It is the kind of legislation that got the largest Flemish party condemned in Belgium, because this party had criticised adopted immigration policy. People should therefore know what they want. It is impossible to be a little in favour of the free expression of opinion. Either one is in favour of the free expression of opinion, and accepts all the consequences that this entails, or one is not.
Giusto Catania - who lives up to his name in being 100% just - must have thought, even if he did not state it in writing, that access should be improved not only to work, but also to benefits, since the elderly are mentioned. Therefore benefits for young people, the disabled and the elderly are relevant. I am sure - I see that he agrees - that young people also receive benefits as young people and then work when they are old. I see that he is applauding. I think that you too are in agreement, but since my observations go on the Internet I would like to make it clear that I have said this to gently point out that the elderly too have a right to benefits.
I suggest that this report could have done more for areas of disability that need more work. On that note, however, I am happy that Parliament chose to support my Amendment 42 which urges the Commission to make sure that money goes only to Member States who meet the criteria of the UN Convention when it comes to deinstitutionalisation. This is a key issue for me and for many people in this House. There are many issues in this report - as others have said - that are for subsidiarity, and not for the European Union, which does not legislate on abortion and should not and will not be legislating on abortion. So I could not support the overall report. Instead, I abstained because I believe the disability amendment is important for those of us who care for those who do not speak, have no voice and are not listened to.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what Mr Pirker said, and therefore I do not need to spend any more time on that. I believe that Mr Catania has written about the wrong subject; this report should not even have reached the Chamber, because the official services ought to check whether a report addresses the subject and title assigned, or whether it is something else entirely. This report is something else entirely, and does not, in fact, refer to the title and mandate given to it.
(NL) Mr President, rarely have I voted against a report with so much conviction as today. If we were to follow the recommendations set out in this report, we would create a dictatorship of political correctness in the European Union tomorrow, whereby, under the guise of so-called anti-racism in pompous declarations of principle, the free expression of opinion involving topics such as asylum and immigration would be curbed even further. This report sets out to open even wider the floodgates to legal and illegal immigration into the European Union, and fails to place the citizen's right to safety at the heart of its policy, but considers instead that it is the rights of criminals that should be recognised as so-called fundamental rights.
Children have the right to speak with their parents in their mother tongue. If the parents are of different nationalities, they should have the right to speak in both of them. However, the Jugendamt is acting against the interests of children from mixed marriages by promptly restricting access to the non-German parent. The Committee on Petitions has recorded over 200 complaints in this matter. That is why I supported Amendment 24. Its rejection has led to my final vote against a report that negates the right to life through pro-abortion legislation and breaks the principle of subsidiarity.
(HU) Mr President, the report we have just adopted, entitled 'On the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union', is comprehensive and represents a breakthrough in several aspects. Its presentation of children's rights and basic social rights merits special attention. I deem it exceptionally good that at long last it takes a correct approach to the problems and rights of traditional national minorities, laying down the principles of self-governance and language use, areas in which the Union has been quite late in creating norms.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President. In the final vote, I voted against this report, which was worthy of support in many ways. I voted against, because the report confuses traditional minorities and their rights with the economic migrants and forcibly relocated migrants who flooded into my country, as a result of the occupation of Latvia after the Second World War. During the course of 50 years of occupation, the indigenous nation was watered down to 50% and even to minority status in Latvia's 13 largest towns and cities, including the capital city, Riga. Thank you.
- (CS) Mr President, I did not support this populist text which, in the original version, contained a number of useful provisions on greater transparency in respect of political activities within the European Union. Unfortunately, it was amended. I have no intention of promoting nonsense such as the disclosure of the professional and personal documents which fellow Members exchange among themselves or which they receive from nongovernmental organisations and lobby organisations. While I do not consider such documents to be confidential, no national parliament in a civilised democracy imposes the duty to disclose professional - let alone all - correspondence.
in writing. - (NL) Common sense has prevailed in the Coelho report, and this is why I have emphatically voted in favour of it. It is to be welcomed that the use of biometric data in passports and travel documents will become subject to stricter rules and harmonisation, especially since the abolition of Europe's internal borders has demonstrated the need for reinforced safety controls at the external borders. A uniform and harmonised system of biometric data, amongst other things, will enable us to fight crime more effectively. This report makes a hesitant step in that direction.
in writing. - (EL) Even children must be put on file because they are considered potentially dangerous to the EU. This is the proposal by the European Commission, the EU Council and the European Parliament. The only difference between the proposal for a directive and the European Parliament is the age at which a child is considered dangerous. The Commission considers that children become dangerous at six years old and must therefore give fingerprints which are incorporated in personal passports from that age, while the European Parliament, demonstrating its 'democratic sensibilities', considers that children must be put on file when they are slightly older, namely at 12 years of age.
This unacceptable directive, which has been approved by the supporters in the European Parliament of the one-way street in Europe, is the inevitable result of the EU's frantic 'anti-terrorism' policy which, in order essentially to safeguard the sovereignty of capital over the labour and grassroots movement, has dangerously christened even children as dangerous. It would appear that the EU is making appropriate use of the experience of the Israeli army, which over-defends the 'security' of the Israel state from Palestinian 'terrorists' by slaughtering countless children in Gaza as we speak. How old are the murdered Palestinian children? Are they six or twelve years old?
It is clear in the report that the Member States have sole authority for defence and national security, which we feel it is important to emphasise. We believe that equipment, civil works and services should normally be procured in this field, too. However, we believe that it is a natural consequence of the nature of this market that procurement cannot be carried out entirely in accordance with the rules of the directive. These exceptions, however, should only apply when they can be justified on account of their significance in relation to security policy. We believe that in this way we can cope with the habitual use of exemptions for protectionist reasons, which is particularly damaging to Swedish industry.
in writing. - Alexander Graf Lambsdorff has presented a proposal concerning the Commission's 'Defence Package', covering procurement for both military and non-military security purposes as well as covering public contracts concluded between EU operators. This proposal improves upon the 2004 Directive (2004/18/EC) currently in force by increasing flexibility, transparency and, vitally, fair competition. The defence procurement market is a very specific one, and Mr Lambsdorff has provided a means of addressing its complex nature.
However, it is in keeping with the logic of Brussels, whereby no sector, not even strategic or vital ones, can be exempt from its supervision, from liberalisation or from privatisation. It does not guarantee respect for Member States' sovereignty, even though they alone are legally responsible for their national security. It does not encourage the existence of far-reaching markets in Europe, where the States' defence budgets are drastically reduced. It does not introduce any system of Community preference, which alone would enable a true European market to emerge naturally. It strengthens the civilian/military dichotomy, which is so specific to Europe and which has already cost us so dearly. Above all, it puts economic and market considerations above everything else. These serious flaws on key points are the reason for our opposition.
We have particular concerns about the negative consequences of insisting that, in spite of investment by national governments and firms in defence R&D, there should then be open competition for subsequent production contracts. This will remove the ability to recoup R&D investment and offer no means of protecting intellectual property, jobs or export opportunities. We are also concerned that an inward-looking European approach will be detrimental to our very necessary and fruitful defence industrial relationships with other countries - especially the US, but also Japan, Israel and other countries.
Dichloromethane, in fact, has many adverse effects on human health: it has a narcotic and depressive effect on the central nervous system, as well as causing cardio-toxicological effects at high exposures. It is therefore necessary for the current legislation on the health and safety of workers to be enforced, since, the enforcement procedures in this field are inadequate, mainly because of the large number, small size and mobile nature of the enterprises supplied. Finally, I agree with Mr Schlyter's statement that we need to take special account of the health of children, who are more susceptible to health risks because of the significant potential for a high level of exposure.
The vote that took place today on this report, which I presented on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007, is an important contribution to creating minimum international standards at global level that guarantee better working conditions, more safety and fewer fatal accidents, in a sector that is very dangerous but also strategic. It puts defence of the dignity and the hard working life of fishermen at the centre of our concerns, given that it is the area with the highest percentage of fatal accidents. It should be noted that the report had 671 votes in favour and only 16 against.
in writing. - (SV) The European Parliament is calling on Member States to ratify the ILO Work in Fishing Convention (Convention 188). This convention dates from 2007 and deals with important issues such as the fishermen's working environment, hours of rest and social security. It should be up to the Member States to decide, in a democratic process, whether or not they wish to ratify the present ILO Convention. I have therefore voted against the present report, as this is not a matter that the European Parliament should involve itself in.
ILO Convention 188, adopted in June 2007, is a document that seeks to allow fair competition between the owners of fishing boats and to confer dignified working conditions for professionals in the sector. The convention pursues these objectives by establishing a set of international minimum standards for the fishing sector that, in certain areas, are within the exclusive competence of the Community. It therefore seems necessary to propose to the Member States that they should ratify this convention, in the interests of the Community and the consistency of the common fisheries policy.
One of the objectives of the 2007 document is to achieve and maintain a level playing field in the fishing sector by promoting decent living and working conditions for fishers and fairer conditions of competition in the world, seeking to remedy the low rate of ratification of many conventions in the field of maritime labour. To that end, the adoption of the Convention represents a step forward in establishing dignified working conditions for professionals in this important strategic sector, in that it covers a variety of aspects of professional activity, namely improved installations and safety conditions at work, pay, medical care at sea and on land, rest periods, work contracts and social security.
I voted in favour of the report. In tackling the issue of fundamental rights in the EU today we must not, however, omit to refer to the terrible events in Gaza. What is happening in the Middle East requires the EU to pay constant attention to the issue of respect for fundamental human rights, which are unfortunately in jeopardy at these times. In fact, I would argue that, in the difficult negotiations which I hope can make progress, the authority and firmness of the Community institutions partly depend on the quality of democracy that we are able to achieve within the EU.
There is, unfortunately, a real danger that even in Europe the fight against terrorism may result in failure to respect fundamental rights and freedoms. I am hopeful about the statements by the US President-Elect, Barack Obama, regarding the commencement of cooperation on this issue between Europe and the United States. Thinking about all the aspects that make up the framework of the inviolable rights of man, I consider, finally, that special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable individuals, namely children, the elderly, migrants, and young people looking for work.
in writing. - Conservatives recall their long-held view that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not be justiciable. In this context we believe that many of the issues dealt with by this report are properly in the purview of Member States and not matters on which the EU should try to impose a policy. The report also contains a number of issues which are matters of individual conscience, for example, the implicit recommendation on euthanasia and the decriminalisation of hard drugs. For these reasons, we are unable to vote in favour of this report.
It is not possible to discuss human rights without speaking of the first and most fundamental one: the right to life. Every year in the 27 Member States approximately 1 200 000 human beings are destroyed in deliberate abortions. This is a tragic figure, and in addition to this number there are the illegal abortions and the incalculable number of human embryos destroyed through the use of the in vitro fertilisation technique. We have a duty to note the diversity of opinions on this issue, but it is certain that this is an attack on the very basis of the culture of human rights. The resolution, however, not only ignores the problem, but seeks to ensure it is forgotten, focusing its attention only on the 'reproductive and sexual health' of women.
I support the rights of persons belonging to minorities, but I categorically reject the idea of territorial autonomy based on ethnic criteria and of minorities' collective rights, an idea which has sparked in practice ethnic separatism and interethnic conflicts. In addition, vague, controversial concepts like 'self-governance' and 'cultural autonomy' also have the potential to cause conflict. These concepts extend beyond current European standards of international law with regard to the rights of persons belonging to national minorities and lead us into an area of controversy.
in writing. - (PL) Although the desire to respect human rights is one of the mainstays of all states and organisations at international level, this report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union 2004-2007 is a scandalous breach of those same rights in Europe. For this reason I could not support it in today's vote. Yet again, we have an attempt to impose a particular view of the world, expressed by the author of the report, on the Member States. That is something I cannot agree to.
in writing. - UKIP is opposed to female genital mutilation, homophobia, racism and xenophobia. However we are also against EU control of fundamental rights. The UK already has perfectly good laws and safeguards on fundamental rights. The EU is not democratic and is therefore not a suitable guardian of people's rights. Moreover, family law is a Member State competence and not an area of EU jurisdiction. The issue of whether drug abusers should face criminal charges is a matter for Member State law and the EU should not be seeking to pervert the course of justice.
It notes that the recommendations of this Parliament in its report on CIA Rendition activities in the EU (Feb 2007) have not yet been implemented by Member States and EU institutions. The fight against terrorism can never be used to diminish the level of protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Indeed, to defend human rights is precisely to fight against terrorism in both its causes and effects. In that respect, I welcome the statement by US President-Elect Barack Obama on closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and to never again practice Rendition.
The European Commission should therefore concentrate on encouraging Member States to cooperate more closely with it by inviting them to include in future reports on human rights not just analyses of the situation in the world at large, but in individual Member States. Also deserving attention are a series of proposals aimed at effectively combating discriminatory policies in the EU, underlining that equal opportunities are a fundamental right of every citizen, and not a privilege. It is very disturbing that around 20% of children in the European Union live below the poverty threshold, and many of them come from single-parent families or families whose parents come from outside the EU. In this regard it is necessary to adopt appropriate means of accessing rights, concentrating particularly on the needs of children, and for Member States to take effective measures to tackle poverty.
in writing. - (FR) Mr Catania's report is nothing short of alarming. It is a catalogue of all the rights, privileges and exorbitant rights of ordinary law which, according to him, should necessarily be granted to minorities, especially if they are non-European. It is a set of instructions with which to destroy national and regional identities, to destroy the values, traditions and cultures of our countries, and to discriminate systematically and institutionally against Europeans in their own countries. It is an attack on our inalienable right to self-determination - which is granted to all nations except our own.
in writing. - (PL) I voted against the report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union 2004-2008 authored by the Italian MEP Giusto Catania, as the author has not so much presented a description of the situation over the past four years as expressed his own opinions, suggesting and even attempting to impose upon Member States legislation that is exclusively within their competence. I do not believe that the countries of the European Union can be forced to issue legislation that their public finds unacceptable.
The very definition of 'marriage' should be reserved for unions between women and men. Mr Catania's proposal will not so much lead to tolerance of homosexual behaviour (which I support), but to discrimination against fundamental biological, that is, heterosexual, relations. Essentially, we need to ask whether the aim is actually to restrict the rights of the family in its traditional meaning, that is, mother, father and children. This makes the highly personal issues relating to a person's sex life into politicised acts, even if it is through public demonstration of one's homosexuality, for example through so-called 'love parades'.
in writing. - (HU) I consider my fellow Member's report of special significance, since human rights constitute one of the pillars of the values set out in the Treaties of the European Union. In addition to democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights is what we require of candidate countries, and we also emphasise the affirmation of universal, inalienable rights in our international relations. However, the European Union will only be a credible global defender of human rights if in its own territory it uses unfailingly every instrument available to defend the values expressed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
in writing. - (LT) One of the fundamental freedoms of citizens in the Community is freedom of movement. I believe that all EU citizens have the same right to participate in the political life of the European Union (EU), to freely express their political opinions and attitudes. These freedoms became even more important after EU expansion to the countries of Eastern Europe, as once the Eastern European countries had joined the EU, economic migration from the new Member States to Western Europe intensified greatly. Lithuania for its part leads in terms of the number of people who have emigrated since entry to the Community. When I met Lithuanian emigrants in London I learnt that many of these people plan to remain in the United Kingdom long-term, especially those who have started families there and are enrolling their children in schools. To my knowledge, such a tendency is also reflected in statistics. The situation is also similar in the other EU countries Lithuanians have emigrated to. I believe that it is particularly important to guarantee the right of these citizens to participate in European Parliament elections in the country where they are currently resident.
in writing. - (PL) I voted against Giusto Catania's report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2004-2008). I voted against the report not because I am against fundamental rights. On the contrary, I believe they are of exceptional importance to the European Union and the whole world. The problem is that Mr Catania's report is harmful to the implementation of fundamental rights. Why is this? It is because the demand for European legislation to fight homophobia or recognise same-sex partnerships are not fundamental rights. If they are to be legislated on, they should be part of a completely separate report. The European Parliament cannot effectively extend the definition of fundamental rights because it does not have the authority to establish international law. In addition, some Member States disagree with such an extended interpretation. It is therefore nothing more than a political gesture and wishful thinking.
The danger is that this is an area in which the Member States do and should take their own decisions. Imposing such views is a slap in the face for cohesion in the European Union. I do not like homophobia, but legislating against it in community law is absurd. If the EU is to tackle homophobia, one could just as easily say that it should tackle anti-Polonism, Russophobia, Germanophobia, Francophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Papism, anti-clericalism, anti-Catholicism and a variety of other attitudes and modes of behaviour. And forcing Member States to accept the legality of same-sex marriages could be even more dangerous.
With reference to point 61, however, I would like to say this. I would find it problematic if someone were simultaneously opposed to awareness of the right to reproductive and sexual health (which, generally speaking, is a euphemism for the right to an abortion) and the mention of facilitating access to contraception in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Opposing both at the same time I would see as a reality gap that could only result in undesirable consequences. This I say with all due respect, and I want to thank all parties once again for this rewarding exchange of views.
in writing. - (SV) The June List believes that protection of the fundamental freedoms and rights is of utmost importance, both within and outside the EU. It is extremely important that the Member States of the EU observe the fundamental freedoms and rights, and it is clear that we cannot leave it to the Member States to monitor themselves. However, the June List is critical of the establishment of a new European agency in this area and of the desire to conduct an 'external policy'. We believe that the UN - not the EU - with its global scope, extensive experience and competence, is best placed to monitor and implement the measures that are necessary.
in writing. - (DE) If the population of individual EU Member States decides to allow homosexual couples to marry, to enter into a civil partnership or to adopt children, other Member States should not be forced to follow suit. If the convictions of religious leaders or politicians mean that they are not exactly ecstatic about homosexuality - as the politically correct mainstream dictates - they should not be condemned or persecuted for these convictions. The same goes for the racism cudgel that is readily swung at anyone drawing attention to aberrations connected with asylum and foreign nationals.
Instead, it is being attempted undemocratically, through the back door, to force homosexual partnerships on Member States - which is probably a foretaste of what awaits us if we implement the Treaty of Lisbon. Anyone daring to criticise homosexuality or point out goings-on in connection with asylum and coexistence with foreign nationals is to be stigmatised as a criminal - in violation of the human right to free expression. Therefore, the Catania report is to be rejected in the strongest terms.
One of the issues dealt with in the report is the free movement of labour which, unfortunately, not all European citizens can enjoy at the moment on an equal basis. Although the two-year period of labour market restrictions imposed on the new Member States expired at the end of 2008, six of the Member States have extended the restrictions for Romania and Bulgaria for another three years, justifying the decision to extend the restriction period on grounds of the current financial crisis. The report does not explicitly discuss this problem, even though it involves differentiated treatment among EU citizens, which is not justified on this occasion.
I voted against this report which contains, apart from at least ten points worthy of criticism (which is a kind way for us to describe them), an unacceptable reference to Council of Europe Recommendation 1201. This recommendation should not be invoked without explaining very precisely the interpretation which is being given to it as it could be interpreted as granting collective rights to minorities or territorial autonomy based on ethnic criteria. I welcome the approval of Amendment 35, which is very reasonable, but in my view, a number of aspects of the report cannot be accepted.
in writing. - (EL) The report endeavours to help conceal the so-called 'democratic and social deficit' of the - by its very nature - deeply reactionary EU, so as to make it more attractive and blunt the dissatisfaction caused by its anti-grassroots policy. It accepts and welcomes all the reactionary principles and institutions which have been adopted by the EU, such as the four freedoms in the Maastricht Treaty, by trying to ascribe an effective dimension to their application.
It is based mainly on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights accompanying the anti-grassroots Treaty of Lisbon, which is below the level of rights safeguarded in many Member States. It largely constitutes a report of ideas and a vague wish list, it addresses fundamental rights, such as labour, education and health rights, simply as 'opportunities' which need to be give 'equally' to everyone, something which is physically impossible in practice and, wherever it is more specific, it proposes addressing only certain extreme cases of poverty, discrimination and so forth with measures such as the adoption of a minimum wage and so on. Finally, the lack of any reference to anti-democratic decisions and the prosecution of citizens, such as the ban on communist parties and other organisations and the imprisonment of communists and other fighters in Member States of the EU in central Europe and the Baltic, is revealing of the nature of the report.
in writing. - (EL) I voted for the report on the situation of fundamental rights in Europe, because I believe that it touches on one of the most basic problems of our unifying structure by engaging in constructive criticism. Discrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental rights derives mainly from the sex, age, origin or sexual orientation of those discriminated against, as the report accurately points out. The problem is exacerbated when the victims of such violations cannot react, mainly because they are locked up in mental asylums, care homes and so on. Europe cannot remain indifferent in the face of this situation, especially where tightening human rights will help to consolidate the European area of freedom and security. Consequently, and given the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is not binding and the very limited facility for private individuals to take recourse to the Community courts, I cannot but welcome the proposals made by Mr Catania on the establishment of a general obligation on the part of the Community institutions to take account of human rights in the performance of their duties and the setting up of a specialist agency for the purpose.
The proposed amendments and supplements relating to reproductive health which the EP has voted for deny the right to life and violate the principle of subsidiarity. Respect for every unborn child and the need to protect human life from conception onward are matters of principle for me. I do not agree that we should adopt decisions at a European level on issues where Member States have differing attitudes stemming from their Christian traditions. I do not agree that the EU should force Slovakia, Poland, Ireland and other Member States to agree to abortions or euthanasia, which are not allowed under their national legislations. At a European level, it is always the case that we talk only about the mother's right to decide on the life or death of her child, and we forget about the unborn child's right to life.
I voted against the Catania report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union 2004-2008 because the report has gone beyond its mandate, making recommendations and comments which go beyond the 2004-2008 period, which it had to report on. Instead of dealing with specific cases of human rights violations, the Catania report makes comments and recommends Member States to apply regulations which contradict national regulations. For example, in Articles 38 and 76 the notion of same-sex marriage is used, something which violates not only our religious views, but also our legal and rational views.
If I had been in favour of the 'no' campaign in the Irish referendum, I would have enthusiastically applauded the Catania report and its supporters. It represents such a gross disrespect for the principle of subsidiarity and tramples underfoot the institutional rules of the European Union and the powers of the Member States to such an extent that it gives credence to all those who feed distrust of the political voracity of Brussels. To attack the safeguard clauses, which are a direct expression of the Treaties and a fundamental guarantee of the democracy of the Member States, as serving 'to codify ... discriminatory practices' is pathetic and grossly undermines the fundamental rights of citizenship.
To assert that the signature of international conventions by a majority of Member States places an obligation on the whole EU to abide by them is a complete legal absurdity, a plunge into darkness that goes beyond the most extreme federalism. I also reject the absolutely perverse assertion of the 'lack of credibility' of Europe, which is bound to lead to our 'tactical inferiority': whatever specific problems it might have, Europe is not Sudan, nor the People's Republic of China, nor Cuba, Somalia or North Korea. In short, the report strays into areas of political struggle that have nothing to do with fundamental rights, thereby stripping it of credibility, consistency and effectiveness. I voted against it.
in writing. - (DE) I voted against the Catania report. I am astounded that the House's services even declared this report admissible in its present form. It persistently infringes the principle of subsidiarity. In terms of its content, virtually everything is worthy of criticism. The nation-states must not let themselves be incapacitated or disempowered when it comes to fundamental rights. This represents an attempt to push through, to the detriment of the majority, minority rights that cannot be implemented at national level. A positive attitude to abortion is inconceivable to me. The actual subject, human rights and their implementation over the last four years, is not mentioned.
Admittedly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was the result of a consensus reached after more than a year of negotiations between various pressure groups and lobbies, representatives of civil society and national governments, and so on. This exercise to which we, as representatives of the countries of the East, were not invited to take part in, is interesting in more ways than one. The Charter, as the Catania report emphasises, will be a non-legally binding text until the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified by all the Member States.
However, the Agency for Fundamental Rights, set up in Vienna, Austria, is based entirely on this political text, which it uses to justify the positions it adopts. It is therefore interesting to get a glimpse of how fundamental rights under the Charter are considered, by analysing the subjects dealt with by the Agency for Fundamental Rights. This exercise is all the more interesting when applied to the network of FRALEX experts recruited in summer 2008 and mainly belonging to the Dutch network 'Human European Consultancy'.
I fully support the agreement concluded by employers and employees on certain aspects of the working conditions of workers in the maritime shipping sector, as it strikes a fair balance between the need to improve working conditions and to protect the health and safety of seafarers. Furthermore, I am convinced that it is essential to define and enforce global minimum standards of employment and health and safety conditions for seafarers working at sea or on board seagoing ships. Finally, I am happy with the role played by employers and employees in improving health and safety conditions for workers.
I voted in favour of the report. Now, more than ever, we are realising the importance of the role that can be played by a body such as the Human Rights Council (HRC). The action taken to date should be supported, and we should also appreciate the active role played by the EU within the HRC, despite the undeniable restrictions represented by the absence of the United States; in fact, this absence often places the EU in an isolated position. That, however, should not be an excuse for the EU, which ought to be able to make a political effort to build a united, cohesive leadership, overcoming the opposing geographical blocs that are often to be seen within it.
I voted in favour of this motion for a European Parliament resolution because the respect, promotion and guarantee of the universality of human rights are an integral part of the European Union's legal acquis and it is one of the EU's fundamental principles. I also voted for it because the United Nations Organisation and its UNHRC are one of the most suitable organisations for tackling comprehensively issues linked to human rights and the challenges in the humanitarian sector. I believe that human rights and democracy are key elements in the EU's external relations and external policy.
Unfortunately, the positive elements are too few and far between. One of the most objectionable wordings is found in recital H, where it complains about 'a persistent desire on the part of Member States to act independently at the UN'. 'One state, one vote' is, after all, one of the foundation stones of the United Nations. The Committee on Foreign Affairs also regrets the growing division of the UNHRC into regional blocs. Paradoxically enough, certain regional blocs - the EU, for example - seem to be desirable.
How can a community purporting to set so much store by democracy deny referendum results, repeat votes until they produce the desired result and punish Member States for election results? If the EU was really so concerned about respect for its oft-cited community of values, it would have had to break off accession negotiations with Turkey long ago, but at the very latest since its display of warmongering. Instead of really working to promote human and people's rights and common values, the EU is at present apparently throwing away approximately EUR 15 million each year on a superfluous European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).
To debate and decide, by voting, on human rights in a world with countries that do not pay any attention to them can be expected to have a bizarre result. This is not only a question of legitimacy. It is, above all, a question of language. What evaluative standard on human rights can one suppose the Governments of Libya or Zimbabwe share with democratic states that are answerable to their populations? None, of course. However, it is precisely to facilitate dialogue between those who speak different languages that diplomacy exists. Among equals mediation is not necessary.
However, I would like to highlight one aspect. I believe that publishing the European institutions' working documents is only a first step because the majority of Europe's citizens do not understand the procedures we use and will not know how to find the information they need. I agree in this respect with my fellow Member, who is proposing the creation of a single European access portal for all documents, with a structure which makes it easy for anyone to understand. This portal should present information in an accessible, simplified manner so that European citizens can use it without any problem. Such technical solutions definitely exist and I hope that the financial resources will be found for implementing this portal.
in writing. - (NL) As I am in favour of maximum openness in all EU institutions, I have emphatically voted in favour of this report. It is a good thing that various European institutions are being given a serious ticking off. The European Council takes major political decisions and discusses very important and controversial issues. Also, it is disappointing and unacceptable that the Council should not allow the precise positions of the different national delegations to be known at the time of decision-making. Parliament should also put its own house in order, though, and should guarantee maximum openness in all its facets.
in writing. - (NL) I emphatically voted in favour of this report. It will not hurt for once. Whilst we have to applaud the fact that some of the European institutions are coming under heavy criticism, I should like to make an observation. In the light of the fact that the European Council is at the helm and ultimately takes decisions on very important and controversial issues, it is unacceptable that the Council should not allow the positions of the different national delegations to be made public at the time of decision-making. It is also true that Parliament should put its own house in order, and should guarantee maximum openness in all its facets, before it hauls others over the coals.
Indeed, this forms part of the wider issue of increasing the part played by citizens of the Union in the way in which the latter operates and understands matters. The peoples of Europe do not want systematically to be excluded from decisions that have a direct bearing on their everyday lives and in relation to which they have no right to inspect or to object. On the rare occasions when they have had their voices heard by referendum, they have disowned their leaders and Brussels bureaucracy, which is blind, deaf and unresponsive to their needs and wants.
It is of fundamental importance for the European Union that citizens feel the Community institutions to be close to them. This can only be achieved through public access to the documents of the three institutions. I am therefore fully in agreement with the rapporteur when he states that we must call on the EU institutions and the Member States to promote a common administrative culture of transparency, founded on the principles outlined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the recommendations of the European Ombudsman and the best practices of the Member States.
in writing. - (DE) I rejected this report. The demands it makes go way beyond what I understand by transparency. I consider even the publication of MEPs' attendance registers and voting lists dangerous without extensive additional channels of explanation. I have a high attendance record and am therefore above suspicion. It is important to preserve legal protection of personality for MEPs, too. Europe could increase transparency by publishing public meetings of the Council and the Commission to begin with, before forcing MEPs to lay themselves bare. In addition, there must be confidentiality among the institutions during difficult negotiation phases.
On the subject of the resolution, my group discussed this again yesterday evening. The discussion was very in-depth and very passionate, but also very thoughtful. I believe that, this morning, as we prepare to vote, we are all shaken by what Mr Wurtz has just told us. When armed hostilities escalate such that international institutions are no longer secure, the situation is extremely serious. An appeal must be made to Israel in particular, in this case, to respect the bodies of the international community, as failure to do so puts the humanitarian infrastructure at risk, which is certainly not consistent with international law.
We have decided to support this resolution, however, as - following yesterday's lengthy discussion - we believe that it is right and vital to adopt it now, and that it is necessary for us, for the European Parliament as an institution, to send out such signals. One thing is quite certain, however, and that is that when violence escalates such that it does not even spare schools and kindergartens, it is a matter not for regret, but for condemnation in the strongest terms. Although this is not contained in the resolution,
Many thanks, Mr Schulz. Since I was unable to take part in yesterday's reception owing to the visit by the President of the Council, Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, I wish to say the following to Mr Rocard. Mr Rocard, I should like to express my friendship and my deep respect for you, and to wish you happiness and success in all your future plans. I hope that we shall continue to see each other frequently, and I wish to thank you for the great contribution you have made to European integration. You have my sincere thanks, Mr Rocard!
She, along with other human rights activists, bravely founded the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights in Tehran. Its purpose was to report human rights violations in Iran, to provide representation of political prisoners and to help their families. However, right from the start, the authorities have tried to close the office down. Those who work there have been threatened, imprisoned and intimidated. Shirin Ebadi has personally faced numerous death threats, and the international community has, for some time, expressed its concern for her safety. Then, just before Christmas, as those at the centre were about to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Iranian security officials closed the centre down.
It is hard for us sitting here in this Chamber to truly comprehend the bravery, the courage and strength required by human rights activists like Shirin Ebadi to function in Iran and stand up to the dictatorship. However, the work of human rights lawyers and activists is needed to shine a light on what is happening in Iran, to give hope to those like the Alaei brothers. Arash and Kamiar Alaei are both doctors helping those with HIV and AIDS who have been charged with cooperating with an enemy, when all they have been doing is trying to help the sick.
When we look at what we do here, we also need to realise that we are actually seeing a shift in the recognition of human rights by certain governments throughout the world, and that this has an impact on countries with which the European Union has dealings. They now feel that they do not have to pay so much attention to human rights because they can trade and work with countries that really do not care. I think, therefore, that makes it even more important for us to make sure that we try to uphold those standards and that, as has been said, we do not look to increase trade with countries whose human rights records are abysmal, but make every effort to support those working for human rights and those democrats opposing the undemocratic forces.
As a result, Iran has been under a constant threat of war, while criticism of the lack of human rights is not expressed. It even leads to a situation where cooperation with the Iranian regime is bought by constantly placing the main exiled opposition groups on the list of terrorists. We must put a stop to the bizarre situation in which, every time there is a judicial ruling declaring this placement on the list of terrorists to be illegal, a new, identical decision is taken by the Council on behalf of the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to draw your attention to the absence of the representative of the Czech Presidency during the course of this debate. I very much regret this fact, as the Czech Republic is heir to the democratic tradition of the struggle for human rights in the whole of Central and Eastern Europe. I repeat: it is deeply regrettable that there is no representative of the Czech Presidency attending this debate, although other Council presidencies, such as the German Presidency, have always sent a representative.
We defend the Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi and oppose the recent actions of the authorities and the government campaign, intended to turn public opinion against Shirin Ebadi. I would also like to draw your attention to further arrests of university students in Shiraz. This week, while the European Parliament has been in session in Strasbourg (on 12 January to be precise), a further six people were arrested. We must defend the independence of the student movement in Iran. I would also like to draw your attention to the repression and harassment of doctors involved in AIDS research.
Although the politicians in power in Iran, in order to improve their image, may sign up to commitments resulting from international agreements, everyday reality is very different. The case of Shirin Ebadi, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Director of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights, may serve as an example. The fact that her activities are persecuted is due to the weakness of the ruling class which, fearful for its status, cannot discipline the fundamentalists involved in anti-democratic activities. We support the Resolution. I think that more radical action needs to be taken in this field.
It is encouraging that several resolutions have been proposed on this subject, initiated by several political groups. I do believe, however, that the resolution put forward by the European People's Party fulfils our obligation to defend human rights much better. As a citizen of a country which has recently experienced both a totalitarian regime and the freedom of speech guaranteed by a democratic regime, I cannot help but sympathise with the cause of this woman fighting for human rights, and I am sure that this matter will be taken into consideration.
(PL) Mr President, Zbigniew Brzeziński describes the arch of instability which stretches from Egypt to Pakistan as the main threat to global stability and future prospects for global development. According to him, the main country in this arch, a sort of linchpin, is Iran. If we do not resolve the problem of Iran, if we do not ensure that it becomes a predictable and democratic country, it will be very difficult to think about eradicating the danger of which Mr Brzeziński speaks.
The European Commission therefore fully supports the French Presidency of the Council of the Union in presenting two declarations regarding Mrs Ebadi's case on 31 and 22 December last year. The Commission especially emphasises the fact that the Iranian authorities must comply with their international obligations in the human rights area and in particular the right of peaceful assembly set out in the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights. Iran has signed and ratified this Pact and hence it must allow the offices of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights to be reopened and it must provide them with the legal status they have been requesting for many years.
author. - Mr President, Guinea has had a very troubled past history, with European countries being involved in one way or another in its tragic past. It was taken over by the Portuguese in the 15th century and its citizens were subjected to the European slave trade in the 16th century and beyond. In 1890, it was colonised by France. After independence in 1958, firm ties were formed with the Soviet Union. Its post-colonial period was largely dominated by presidential totalitarianism, with its rulers being backed by its admittedly rather primitive army.
I have no idea whether Captain Camara is genuine in his endeavours, or whether he will succeed in improving matters in Guinea. One thing is certain, however: things cannot get worse than they have been for the last few decades, during which Europe and the rest of the world were happy just to sit back, watch and enjoy the benefits of the mineral exploitation of Guinea. So, although I oppose military dictatorships a priori, I can only hope that, after a short period of time, a transition to democracy might occur.
At that very moment, were they sincere, those men running a country deemed by Transparency International to be one of the most corrupt in the world and relying on a rule of law and a democracy that have never actually existed? At that very moment, were they recalling how, 24 years ago, General Lanzana Conté seized power when the father of independence in 1958, the Marxist President Sékou Touré, died in 1984? At that very moment, were they thinking that a simple officer in charge of fuel procurement for the army would be able to seize power? At that very moment, were they regretting not having worked hard enough to establish true rule of law and real democracy that would have enabled those precious elections to have been organised within 60 days, as laid down by the constitution?
If they did indeed have these regrets, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara's feelings and those of his friends were to change to remorse within a few hours. On Wednesday 24 December, the unknown captain declared himself the President of the Republic, he was cheered by thousands of Guineans and, on 25 December, he made a display of the allegiance offered by the civil government, who agreed to his ultimatum. He promised to fight corruption and to organise elections before 2010. He appointed a decent man as Prime Minister, an Egypt-based international civil servant. He happily reported that nobody in Guinea was condemning him; the opposition political parties, civil society, accepted this situation.
Should the coup d'état be condemned in these circumstances? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have to condemn it! The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on behalf of whom I am honoured to speak, condemns this coup d'état although we are not naïve; we know that political solutions are never simple when a country is emerging from a dictatorship. We call on you to vote in favour of the joint resolution of the six political groups.
Mr President, on 15 February 2007, we discussed the state violence of dictator Lansana Conté in Guinea as a matter of urgency. This dictator came to power following a coup d'état in 1984 and has been in power ever since. He considered that country his own private property that was of particular significance on account of its natural deposits of gold, iron and bauxite. Most parties did not take part in the elections that were organised under his control, and the official opposition that was temporarily represented in the parliament was later forced to leave.
This appalling regime came unexpectedly to an end when the dictator died in December last year. The junta put a banker forward as its next Prime Minister. The question now is what exactly the military junta that subsequently took over power has made room for. Is this a step towards democracy and equality for all residents, or will this new coup d'état clear the way for a new dictator who is, once again, mainly interested in the country's natural resources and in the prospect of lining his own pockets?
My group has, over the years, always supported the demands of Guinea's democratic opposition, which still appears to be out of the game. We do not condemn the changeover of power, but we do condemn the possible continuation of a lack of democracy in the near future. There is, as yet, no reason to penalise or isolate Guinea, but we should remind the new leaders that their moment in the limelight can only be very short-lived. That country does not need another dictator, but the restoration of democracy.
Mr President, Commissioner, the time has fortunately passed when the only known way to topple a government in West Africa was by means of a military coup. While in countries which share a border with Guinea, namely Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast, Senegal or Liberia, a political thaw is taking place, military regimes have collapsed and a young democracy is emerging, Guinea remains stuck in the past. The late President Conté himself seized power in a military coup, and now there is a sense of déjà vu. Twenty-four hours after the President's death was announced, the military seized power in Guinea and suspended the constitution.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, we have before us another case where a group of officers has seized power. Military juntas behave in a similar way: first there are arrests, then the constitution is suspended, and later there is an announcement that democratic elections will be called. In this case, the elections are to be held in two years' time. However, in practice, the officers start to exercise power and find that they like it. This then leads to social oppression and revolts, as well as violations of human rights and democratic principles. We have reason to suspect that the same might happen in Guinea, although we all hope that things will be different this time, that events will take a turn for the better and that the outcome will be more positive.
I think that the announcement made by the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union that they were suspending Guinea's participation in their work exerts a certain pressure and appeals to common sense. I think that, in view of the social situation, i.e. the constantly falling per capita income, the European Union, and therefore the European Commission, will also take appropriate and considered, but also courageous, action to ensure that normality returns to this country as soon as possible, for the good of its people, and in order to prevent genocide and human rights violations.
(PL) Mr President, the coup d'etat in Guinea has followed the same pattern as the majority of similar coups in Africa and on other continents. It took place immediately after the death of President Conté, who came to power following a coup 24 years earlier. The economic and political situation in this extremely poor country incites the people to protest. These protests are then pacified by the armed forces, which consolidate a corrupt government and the division of the country into those who prosper and those who are dying of hunger.
The European Commission wholeheartedly supports the declaration of the EU Presidency condemning this violent takeover of power and calling on the authorities in Guinea to return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government as quickly as possible. The positive reception accorded to the military regime by the Guinean public, especially by political parties and trade unions, clearly shows that the standard of living for the Guinean people has deteriorated so much that even a military coup is viewed as a change for the better and as an event creating optimism for the future. It also shows that the former regime had lost the trust of the Guinean people to such an extent that they preferred the government to be taken over by military units rather than official successors.
In this confused situation, it is important to welcome the rapid and effective initiatives undertaken by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and its chairman, Mr Chambas, as well as the determination and decisiveness of the Community and the African Union, which have suspended Guinea's membership in their organisations and have condemned the violent takeover of power. The Commission is determined to support the efforts of ECOWAS and the African Union and to support their efforts to enable the quickest possible return to a civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections.
(HU) In the Intergroup for Regional and Minority Languages we have drawn up a report for the purpose of protecting traditional national minorities. Why is this important? Many of the new Member States, among them Romania, for instance, have no legislation for minorities. Last year we witnessed uniformed policemen beating up civilians in Slovakia. Ever since the new government took office in Romania, we have noticed that the symbols of minorities are being removed, that it is seen as a problem if someone speaks more than one language, and that several hundred children were accidentally left out of school enrolment. This is why we think it important for the European Parliament to produce a report, a resolution, guaranteeing the protection of minorities, the protection of traditional ethnic minorities. Thank you very much, Mr President.
(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Czech Presidency began one month ago, but it has already managed to spit in our faces and insult us with its gift: Estonia is covered with a hammer and sickle, there is a drunken man on the floor of a Finnish sauna, Germany has a swastika, Italy has football players holding balls near their genitals, Bulgaria is covered with toilets, etc. etc. This is how the artist who made the Czech Republic's gift to the European Union portrayed the nations and countries of the European Union in his work.
Art can and often must shock, but is the mocking of another country and people the most fitting way to do so? The Czech Government speaks of the artist's freedom of expression: true, but here that freedom has definitely been used in the wrong context. The government is apparently not permitted to interfere with the artist's creative freedom: this is also true but, in giving this gift, the Czech Government has accepted the message that this gift conveys, and, as the gift-giver, it, and not the artist, must now bear responsibility for the consequences. It is difficult to understand how the leadership of the Czech Republic can consider itself entitled to insult other Member States.
(PL) Mr President, five thousand juggernauts drive through the town of Augustów every day. Every day children go to school, walking along the side of the road itself, because there is no footpath. Almost every day one of them dies under the wheels of a juggernaut. Eco-terrorists have blocked construction of a bypass, in the name of protecting birds from noise. For every week that this development is held up, one of the children of Augustów has to pay with his or her life. Neither the eco-terrorists nor the judges of the European Court of Justice send their own children under the wheels of juggernauts. The lives of the children of Augustów are, however, being accorded less importance than the well-being of birds.
The recent confession by the Turkish actor Attila Olgaç to the murder of 10 Greek Cypriot captives during the Turkish invasion in Cyprus in the summer of 1974 has brought to light once more the crimes committed by Turkey and entails an inescapable responsibility for Turkey to open its archives for the investigation of the fate of all missing persons. The international community, in which the European Union is a significant player, must put all possible pressure on Turkey to comply with international law, the related decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, and all relevant UN resolutions.
The European Union has fifty million Europeans with various health problems who in everyday life come up against various difficulties. Many of them have turned to me with requests regarding the need for mutual recognition of ID cards for severely disabled people. Handicapped citizens cannot use these cards in all EU Member States. As an example, this makes it difficult for them to park their cars in designated parking spaces. I have submitted a question to the Council and to the Commission and I hope that measures to harmonise these cards will be adopted as soon as possible.
(HU) Mr President, according to the Charter of the United Nations, all peoples have the right of self-determination. This also applies to the 1.5-2 million Hungarians in Transylvania. Two years ago the Székely National Council organised an informal referendum on regional autonomy for Székely Land. In this referendum carried out using mobile ballot boxes, in spite of an artificially instigated anti-Hungarian propaganda campaign, 99% of the 210 000 voters asked voted in the affirmative. Recently, a significant number of local governments in Székely Land launched a new initiative for a comprehensive official referendum. The state bodies and their local representatives, the so-called prefects, are making every effort to hinder Székely Land's Hungarians in the peaceful, lawful and democratic expression of their will. I ask Parliament and President Hans-Gert Pöttering to keep a close eye on further developments concerning the referendum in Romania, and to extend protection to the local governments that are under threat from the authorities. Thank you.
I am concerned. For 10 days now a terrible strike has been taking place in Guadeloupe, bringing everything to a standstill, oil included. This strike is lasting so long because the people of the French West Indies and Guyana are suffering from the cost of living, which is one and a half times higher than in metropolitan Europe. Although this has so far been a purely French problem, it has now in fact become a European one, and the Commission's refusal to negotiate a specific OR-Cariforum agreement for us is in my view a disgrace.
(EL) Mr President, recently we have heard about, we have read about and we have seen civilians being bombed and children being exterminated. Recently we saw a gentleman from Turkey who admitted in public that, during the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey in 1974, he murdered 10 handcuffed Greek Cypriot soldiers. What we have not seen, Mr President, is a willingness on the part of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, a willingness which was so evident when it came to those involved in events in Yugoslavia; the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is still chasing them. Consequently, I think that it is a legitimate demand for us to ask Parliament to tell us if there is a list of countries which come within the jurisdiction of The Hague Court or if there are countries which are indifferent to and dismissive of this Court. I think that our demand to know which countries and citizens are being brought before the Court in The Hague as defendants and which are not is a legitimate demand.
(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President. I asked to speak because of a tragic accident that occurred three days ago in Croatia. An 18-year-old man stepped on a landmine and became one of the already numerous victims, among them Italian, Dutch and other European fellow citizens. Croatia is not party to the comprehensive mine clearance programme being financed by the Commission from 2008 to 2013, and yet the number of such mines that have been deployed is unknown. Though Croatia has never produced any mines of this sort, there are life-threatening antipersonnel mines along some 1 000 kilometres of its territory. I respectfully ask the Commission and you, Mr President, to intervene so that Croatia may also benefit from European aid - just like Bosnia, Ukraine, Kosovo and Cyprus - since this is an extremely costly and highly dangerous operation. I have been speaking in my capacity as Chairman - on the EU side - of the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee. Thank you very much for the floor.
(EL) Mr President, demonstrations by farmers in Greece, together with other demonstrations in Europe, are sending out important messages of change in current perceptions about farming and the food issue, by demanding the reform of European and national policies. When, at European level, economies are collapsing, all confidence has been lost in the financial system, small and medium-sized enterprises are gradually disappearing and employment is shrinking, we cannot turn a blind eye to the problems accumulating in the countryside, in farming, in the rural economy and in regional employment. It would be a good idea for the Commission and Parliament to start a dialogue and to present proposals in a bid to deal with the problems, not only so that small and medium-sized farms survive, but also to get them out of the crisis over coming years, to activate the intervention mechanism and to strengthen the crisis management mechanism - so that even loss of income can be covered - and national policies, which could be made more flexible without this necessarily meaning cofinancing of the common agricultural policy.
(LT) European leaders recently expressed the view that they were disappointed with the leaders of Ukraine and Georgia. They are beginning to doubt whether they can democratise those states and lead them into NATO and the European Union. Such views and talk can only support Russia's policies and its special forces. Right before our very eyes we can see Russian provocations whose goal is to weaken President Yushchenko, President Saakashvili and the West-oriented policies they are implementing. There are invisible provocations as well. The best way to see how they are organised would be to examine the KGB archives. Only naive politicians in contemporary Europe can believe that Russia no longer carries out such blackmail and provocations, even though it is led by KGB officer Putin. The latest information provocation is that Georgia kidnapped a Russian soldier. It was fed to Europe all week. Later Russia admitted that the soldier himself had in fact deserted, but the black propaganda had already done its damage. One gets the impression that Russia is playing games with tanks, gas pipelines, information and misinformation brilliantly. However, it is above all the naivety of European politicians which allows Russia to play such games.
Summonses to police stations are increasing, as are disappearances, incidents of intimidation and unexplained deaths. We cannot exclude the possibility that one consequence of the repression will be expressions of unrest from the Tibetans, who will be driven to take extreme measures. The Chinese security services and army will respond by brutally pacifying these protests, and it may turn out that we are dealing with deliberate provocation from the Chinese authorities, who will be counting on the fact that even democratic governments will restrict themselves only to tentative protests during the common struggle with the economic crisis. The European Parliament should express itself clearly and decidedly on this question, and therefore today I will permit myself to submit a draft of an appeal to the Prime Minister of China. Let us together send a signal to the communist regime that we do not consent to the violation of basic rights of the people of Tibet.
(RO) The European Commission has declared 2009 as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation. Creative thinking is the key to success in a global economy, a fact recognised by the European Union a long time ago. Indeed, innovation is an integral part of both the Commission's climate change package and the plan for revitalising the European economy. For its part, the European Parliament must become more actively involved in promoting creativity as a driving force for innovation. Last year the energy and climate change package was adopted and the written declaration on fibromyalgia was approved for which I would like to thank you once again. These documents pave the way for innovation and creativity in areas of paramount importance such as health, by identifying new treatments for fibromyalgia, and energy, by making the new alternative energy sources more efficient.
(HU) Mr President, Hungary, too, entered the Schengen area on 21 December 2007, and yet there are certain issues that have still not been settled on the Austro-Hungarian border. The Burgenland authorities are not really speaking to us. Therefore, in June 2008, my Hungarian compatriots submitted a petition to the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions, which we immediately forwarded to Commissioner Jacques Barrot. Mr Barrot eventually responded, four months later, saying that he did not have sufficient information regarding the petition and that they would try to contact the person who submitted it. Two months after this reply, I myself contacted the person who submitted the petition and asked how things stood. I was told that to date no one from the Commission had been in touch; this does indeed make it difficult for the Commission to obtain information. When I went back to the Commission staff, I was told that they would examine the matter 'within the best delay'. I would like to ask the Commission what the expression 'within the best delay' means, and I would like to express my hope that the campaign for the elections due to be held four months from now will not likewise be conducted by Mr Barroso and Mr Jacques Barrot 'within the best delay'. Thank you very much.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, here is a one-minute rapid snapshot of the still rampant European racism. In Hungary, a few days ago, a police chief constable who had made a racist statement was acquitted and then reinstated after reference was made to a supposed internal investigation. The investigation did not address the question of whether or not the racist statement had in fact been made. In Romania, in the municipality of Tărlungeni, near Braşov, a wall has been erected between the Roma and non-Roma families. In response to a question from a local child asking why they are being separated, the father may perhaps reply: because those living on this side of the wall are bad people, while those on the other side are good people. Ten days ago we voted to adopt the report of the delegation to Italy; since then, a week ago, Italy deployed armed forces against the Roma after two crimes committed by persons unknown. The police forces are sweeping through Roma families with helicopters, dogs and armed police officers. Thank you very much.
However, the scandal of delays in payment of wages and other remuneration owed to workers is also increasing, as is happening in cork companies, some textile companies, and the ceramics and metallurgy sectors, amongst others. This situation is creating serious social problems, increasing poverty and even causing tragic situations in cases of members of the same family working in the company. I was able to ascertain this only days ago at Subercor, a company based in Santa Maria da Feira (part of the Suberus group, in the footwear sector), where workers are struggling because they are not receiving their wages and there are couples who are going hungry and already have no food for their children. These are terrible situations caused by the crisis which is devastating us, the consequences of which can be seen in human faces and people's lives. I therefore appeal not only for solidarity but for these serious problems to be solved.
(HU) Mr President, popular opinion in Hungary has been following with great interest the developments in the water cannon case in Hungary, and would like to have a clear view of the issue as soon as possible. We request the Commission's assistance in this matter. This issue concerns the fact that the Hungarian Government continued throughout 2006-2007-2008 to hold to the view that it had purchased new water cannons at the expense of the Schengen Fund, and that these were used in Budapest on 22 October 2007 to disperse the crowds. At the end of 2008, the Minister for Justice and Law Enforcement stated that this purchase was not paid out of the Schengen Fund, which is an EU resource. The competent European Commissioner confirmed that the cannons had not been purchased out of the Schengen Fund. A day later, a secretary of state at the same Ministry stated that the Hungarian Government had covered the purchase of the water cannons from the domestic sources of the Schengen Fund, contradicting the European Commission. My question is: has the Commission looked into whether the Schengen Fund was used in this case as intended, and has it sought to ascertain the truth with regard to the water cannon purchase? After these events, the credibility and transparency of the actions not only of the Hungarian Government, but also of the European Commission, are at stake. Thank you very much.
(EL) Mr President, it has taken a long time to release the Balkans from unproductive nationalism which is out of step with European standards of behaviour and values. It would appear, however, that some people need to hear this message again. In October 2008, the government of the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia filed an application for Community financing for Corridor 10, which crosses its territory. Just two months later, in a scandalous decision which was even published in that country's official gazette, they decided to name this route 'Alexander the Great of Macedon', thereby blatantly insulting the interim agreement with Greece, which makes express provision for the avoidance of government propaganda and the use of symbols which incite hostility, hatred and violence. I call on the European Commission to link the application for Community financing with the repeal of this scandalous decision, which reminds us that there are still nationalists in the Balkans. We are building a Europe in which there is no room for nationalism.
Mr President, two and a half years ago, I found out that the European Commission had initiated proceedings against Denmark in the European Court of Justice because Denmark had introduced a 2% threshold for hydrogenated fats in food. The Commission did this even though there was scientific evidence to the contrary, which showed in fact that hydrogenated acids are extremely difficult from the point of view of coronary disease etc. Two years ago, therefore, I decided - in conjunction with two of our colleagues, Dan Jørgensen and Linda McAvan - to draft a written declaration. We were supported by 254 Members of Parliament from 25 different Member States, which was huge support.
(EL) Madam President, farmers with small and medium-sized holdings have been on the streets for a fortnight in a fight which has shaken the entire country. The common agricultural policy, which is jointly formulated and implemented by Greek governments, and agreements within the framework of the World Trade Organization have resulted in a reduction in agricultural output, in a drastic cut in the income of farmers with small and medium-sized holdings and in their speedier eradication. Greece's agricultural balance of trade has gone from being in the black to being in the red to the tune of approximately EUR 3 billion for 2008 alone. Instead of meeting the basic demands of small and medium-sized farms, the New Democracy government is trying to mislead them with meaningless announcements and, at the same time, is mobilising the special forces in order to suppress their fight. The Communist Party of Greece and the workers support the fight of small and medium-sized farms against the common agricultural policy and the entire anti-grassroots policy of the European Union and bourgeois governments. They also support their demand for guaranteed minimum prices for agricultural and livestock products, which will cover the production costs and improve the income of small and medium-sized farms.
(EL) Madam President, two years ago Parliament adopted a resolution almost unanimously. In this resolution, it called for the fate of the missing persons in Cyprus to be ascertained. Two years have passed and no progress has been made. The Turkish army was asked to give the competent committee all the information in its possession, but nothing has been done in this direction. On the contrary, today we have a public confession by a Turk who was a soldier at the time and who, for reasons of conscience, because he cannot take it anymore, has confessed that he killed 10 Greek Cypriots. The Turkish army knows about both these crimes and about others and, without doubt, there is not a civilised person today, of Turkish or any other nationality, who does not condemn these war crimes. What, however, must we do? We must step up our efforts to persuade the Turkish army to supply information to the competent committee in order to put an end to the suffering of the missing persons' relatives.
We here represent - look, it is time for nationalist protests, and everyone from all sides should take part - the scourge of the Europe of homelands that is destroying the European homeland and we have a duty to tell Brussels this. In two days' time, a Palestinian will speak. The fact that 80% of Israeli citizens are in favour of Europe, unlike the Jerusalem Government, as the Adenauer Foundation has shown, also shows that even the people of Palestine, Lebanon, the southern Mediterranean and Tunisia are not entitled to move themselves to revolution ...
(RO) Given the current climate in Europe, guaranteeing energy security is becoming a priority. Diversification of energy transit routes can be guaranteed by interconnecting Europe's gas networks, which also supports solidarity between Member States, one of the European Union's fundamental principles. In addition to the financial contributions made by Romania and Hungary themselves, the European Commission proposed last week the allocation of EUR 30 million for the completion of the Arad-Szeged gas pipeline project, the financing for which has been suspended for more than five years.
(DE) Madam President, the meat scandal in Ireland has made waves throughout Europe, including Austria where, as a bizarre consequence of the scandal, Irish meat was sold as Tyrolean bacon. In my view the only solution to this EU-wide problem is a compulsory declaration for fresh meat and meat products, which would contain the following information: place of origin; duration of the animal's journey to the abattoir and from there to the point of sale of the meat; if the meat comes from outside the EU, the country of origin should be specified precisely. In addition, it is high time the European Union had these things checked by inspectors. So that this can indeed be done, I call on the Council, the Commission and you, ladies and gentlemen, to take steps to ensure that European consumers can no longer be misled in this way.
Madam President, many will be aware of the recent dioxin scare in the Republic of Ireland. Beef farmers in Northern Ireland were also caught up in this problem because they imported the compound feed which caused the problem in their animals. The Northern Ireland Executive has now offered the farmers 25% compensation, which will mean ruin for them. The Executive is having problems finding the matching funds, and will not be able to draw the 37.5% that is available from the European Union. I understand that the Government of the Republic of Ireland has made it clear that it will not be accepting any responsibility, even though the feed mill was licensed by it and under its control. There is also a substantial amount of infected pigmeat at one plant. This is a very serious and dangerous problem and must be resolved as soon as possible.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that during the current economic crisis European enterprises are failing to obtain the credits which they very much need to be able to modernise. It is not a case of European enterprises having to produce less, but simply in a more intelligent and environmentally friendly manner. I call on the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and Member States to make the EU's sustainable economic development a priority and to guarantee, through the European economic recovery plan, the conditions required so that European enterprises can modernise and remain competitive in an increasingly tough market.
(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President. The European Union faces the challenges of guaranteeing stability and security, improving the prosperity of its citizens and building a common European future. The historical, national and ethnic minorities are of enduring value to a diverse Europe. Respect for the rights of these minorities has not yet been satisfactorily ensured. The existence of documents such as the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, as well as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, inspires confidence. It is clear that until each Member State of the European Union has ratified these documents, further efforts are needed. Parliament should make it a goal to create a binding framework agreement that will guarantee the protection of national minority communities, recognising that various forms of autonomy and self-determination, based on the principle of subsidiarity, represent reassuring solutions to the situation of minority communities. Thank you very much.
As a result of the Round Table Talks and settlements, elections were held in June 1989, which led to the establishment of the first government led by a non-communist: Tadeusz Mazowiecki. It was that government which showed us that the right direction for Poland to take was not only freedom and democracy, but also integration with the European Union. The changes which took place in my country then triggered the march of many countries of Central and Eastern Europe towards freedom, democracy and integration with the EU.
Following the end of the Memorandum of Understanding in 2005, we did have the agreement on the joint surveillance system - to which Mrs Wortmann-Kool drew our attention - and it has given us early information about trade flows. We are therefore better able to react in the event of being faced with a sudden surge in our industry. It is also a further step in the transition to open markets designed and developed - as I am sure Members know - with the economic players concerned and in discussion with Member States and with Parliament. By promoting a process of gradual change, we have helped the sector adapt. That has been supported by the social partners. They did not ask for an extension of the voluntary growth levels under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) when it ended in 2008, nor have they been asking for a continuation of the surveillance system into 2009 - though I appreciate that some Member States would have preferred us to do so. Imports from China have increased overall, but within reasonable limits. Significant increases in some categories - such as for example dresses, trousers and pullovers - have been balanced by drops in textile imports from suppliers in other countries. So, overall in 2008, only a slight overall increase was realised and markets have absorbed that reasonably well.
The right political responses are not to close our markets or monitoring of the imports. We need to ensure that all businesses can change, adapt, trade and innovate out of current conditions. It is precisely to help businesses like this that the economic recovery plan was endorsed. That, of course, represents a huge boost of 1.5% of EU GDP, which should help the textile and clothing sector. The challenges for the sector predate the current slowdown. Eight of the fifteen applications under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund have been to support textile workers.
The Commission is ready to support initiatives to set up partnerships in the textile and clothing sector designed to anticipate restructuring with the aim of protecting employment and, overall, the sector benefits from the fact that there is a long-standing framework for social dialogue. We welcome Parliament's resolution on the future of the textile sector. We move forward in market access, in funds from the Lead Market Initiative, and in every free trade agreement, as causes dedicated to environmental and social standards. Of course currency devaluation remains on our agenda.
Madam President, textiles and clothing are a globalised sector of the economy par excellence, a sector which is characterised by continual change in terms of the place of production and constant restructurings and adjustments to new situations, such as the liberalisation of international trade. For many Member States of the European Union, including Greece, this sector is an important source of exports and employment. However, the considerable number of production units relocating and the constant reduction in employment have taken on worrying dimensions. In addition to structural problems, the acute discrepancy between the import tariffs of the European Union, on the one hand, and of its most important competitors, on the other hand, is playing a negative role. Commissioner, we are talking about a sector which represents an extremely high percentage of overall seizures of pirated products on the borders of the European Union, a percentage which is constantly rising. In this instance, I consider the proposal to set up a European observatory on pirated products to be a good idea, so that we can achieve better coordination between the competent authorities, Member States and Commission services and also conditions of effective cooperation with the private sector. I think we need to adopt regulations on the 'made in' label, which will help to safeguard conditions of fair competition and consumer protection. The establishment of more effective rules of origin is important in terms of the application of tariff quotas within the framework of the generalised tariff preferences and regional agreements. We are being called upon to shape a new framework of cooperative relations between the agencies that implement industrial and regional policy and commitments and to effectively support European undertakings, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they can maintain and further improve their competitive specialisation. I refer to the production of high added value products in terms of quality and design, innovation and the use of new technologies.
We would like to thank you for your replies to the oral questions. I would like to stress that, as is well-known, the textile sector makes a particularly important contribution to the GDP of all the Member States, including Romania. We are well aware that this sector creates new jobs, especially for the female workforce. I agree with and support the measures which you are proposing because, being aware of how important trade is in the current economic crisis, we need to realise how important the measures are which we need to take to protect jobs.
Bearing in mind that the joint surveillance system for textile imports from China was stopped at the end of last year, which I understand was an important tool for monitoring the market, I would like to suggest to the Commission that it attaches greater importance not only to the textile sector but also to other vulnerable industrial sectors such as steel, chemicals and machines. I would also like to suggest that the European Commission presents on a regular basis impact studies, statistical data or other elements and relevant instruments for these sectors. I would like to congratulate you once again on the measures you have proposed for access, free trade, funds and the environment.
At this point, however, I believe that more than financial support, this sector, like other industrial sectors, requires rules, and requires, as has already been pointed out, genuine reciprocity. While we can understand that, with regard to emerging countries, there are leanings towards really opening up the market to promote the development of those countries and thus new markets, much less understandable is a lack of reciprocity in terms of legislative barriers and tariff barriers with regard to the most developed countries: the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan.
You see, Commissioner, if we take part in a boxing match with one hand tied behind our back, we cannot win. I would also like to reiterate that it is a problem that concerns the United States together with us, and does not just concern China or India. They have rules on traceability, which they impose on our products as well, but which we do not have. This, then, is a fundamental issue, with regard to which I believe the Commission's initiative needs to be stepped up much more than in the past, because we have seen that when it wants to, it can manage even to convince those who would argue, as was the case on the issue of the environment.
To conclude, I feel that there are some measures that are costly and others that are less costly, but the costly ones are part of a package to tackle the crisis, which is about to be launched. They include the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, more credit made available to promote investments and strengthen the capitalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises, more funds for research for the textile technology platform, and more support for exports by small and medium-sized enterprises. The less costly measures are specifically the regulation on origin marking, the protection of intellectual property, anti-dumping and the fight against counterfeiting. If we can put forward all these costly and non-costly measures, I believe that we will help Europe's economy without changing the rules on competition and without falling into neoprotectionism.
More than a year has passed since the debate held in this Parliament on 12 December 2007. We raised the alarm at the time that, if measures were not taken in defence of production and employment in the textile and clothing sector, we would continue to be faced with the slow agony and destruction of a large part of this strategic sector. Since then, and as had happened previously, thousands of jobs have been lost and innumerable companies closed, with 350 000 jobs and 5% of companies having vanished in the last two years alone.
Commissioner, when will binding rules on attaching labels of origin be applied, with the adoption, for example, of the 'made in' regulation? When will the same consumer safety and protection requirements be applied to imported products as are demanded for products made in the European Union? How will the European Union continue to monitor in real time import trends and customs inspection and control, keeping the sector fully informed and invoking safeguard clauses wherever necessary? How will it use the 2007-2013 financial framework, including the so-called Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to uphold production and employment in the textile and clothing sector, in particular in the small and medium-sized enterprises affected by liberalisation? When will there be a monetary and foreign exchange policy that does not penalise the exports of certain Member States? When will the Community programme, proposed by this Parliament, be created, and the financial resources to modernise and promote the sector and the diversification of industrial activity be unblocked, particularly those directed at the least favoured regions which are dependent on it?
We must say 'No' to protectionism which impoverishes, but protection to safeguard fundamental rights of Europeans is absolutely necessary. This is a very important sector in various European regions and countries, as is the case of the region that I come from, the region of Northern Portugal. It is of crucial importance to the regional economy. It is a sector that has been particularly exposed to the globalisation process. In a serious financial crisis like the one we are undergoing, this sector is experiencing absolutely tragic times.
The European Union and the Member States should pay more attention to the textile industry, opting for defensive measures and offensive measures. The defensive measures entail the use of all the mechanisms and instruments of commercial defence that are at our disposal. It also involves maintaining a political dialogue with our main partners to combat situations of real monetary protectionism and situations that threaten the legitimate interests of European producers. To defend European producers, employers and workers is to defend European citizens and also to defend European consumers. That is what we must be aware of, once and for all.
At the same time we have to use these defensive measures in compliance with principles as simple as those that have already been set out here: the principle of reciprocity and the principle of the permanent fight against unfair competition. We are not asking for any special treatment for the European Union or for the most affected regions of the European Union. We are simply demanding that there be rules and that those rules be based on fundamental principles of reciprocity. However, while the European Union and its Member States must not hesitate to fight for the instruments of commercial defence which prove most appropriate at any time to be applied, we must also develop offensive policies and measures. This, in fact, has already been happening, in terms of modernising the sector and also in the areas of human resources development, investment in vocational training, technological modernisation and development of the regions.
(LT) This year up to 50% of the jobs in Lithuania's textile and clothing sector may be lost. Almost 20 000 workers may become unemployed. This would not simply be a consequence of the economic and financial crisis. The textile industry has to withstand unequal competition conditions and apply higher manufacturing, work, hygiene and ecological standards. It is very difficult to compete with China's subsidised production due to the imbalanced exchange rate, bank lending policies, absence of depreciation deductions and tax policy. Moreover, China and other countries are constantly increasing market access barriers affecting EU products. What does the Commission think of a situation in which the price of a Chinese product is less than the raw materials used to manufacture it? What actions does the Commission plan to take to restore equal competition conditions, the so-called level playing field? Moreover, I would like to ask for concrete facts to be produced showing how the Helpdesk department, established by the Commission to aid small and medium-sized businesses, is helping the textile industry to initiate investigations into the application of market protection measures in obvious cases of unfair competition? For your information, linen textile manufacturers have now been trying for two years to initiate an anti-dumping case against linen fabrics of Chinese origin, but so far have been unable to do so because the Commission does not provide any assistance. What does the Commission suggest textile manufacturers do?
In fact, last year textile imports from China went through the roof. There is no doubt that if we look at T-shirts, trousers, dresses and pullovers, in other words the vulnerable product categories, there has been a near doubling of imports in the space of just one year, and that is clearly a cause for great concern. It means that the surveillance system we have had in place all this time is not working. As we all know, the double-checking system is no longer in operation. This situation, Lady Ashton, is untenable because there are no real sanctions we can apply; we have no clout.
As the previous speaker said, the figures also show that there is something fundamentally wrong with the prices of these massive imports of Chinese textiles. Prices have dropped by nearly a third and this drop cannot be attributed to exchange rate differences alone. Moreover, Commissioner, the production costs in China have risen sharply again over the past year, which suggests that these prices are practically dumping prices. We are counting on you not to let this simply pass unchallenged. As stated by Mrs Wortmann-Kool earlier, 350 000 jobs have been lost over the past two years. To a large extent, this is the result of unfair competition and we need to formulate a response to this situation.
That is not the only matter of concern, Commissioner. As you know, credit insurance is much harder to obtain in the current climate, and this is having a direct, pernicious effect on exports. The French Government has already developed a system of additional credit insurance for the clothing and textile sector. It would be worth considering whether we could recommend this system and streamline it further at European level. I am not suggesting harmonisation, but that we attempt to put initiatives in place at European level to promote the French system to some degree. Can you give us a commitment that, using the powers at your disposal, you will implement initiatives in this respect? These initiatives do not have to cost anything. It is simply a matter of political will and coordination.
I think that workers in the textile and clothing sector should be given assistance and that social measures should be drawn up in the form of plans to help companies that are undergoing restructuring and currently find themselves in very difficult circumstances. It would be desirable to direct a substantial part of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to restructuring and retraining in the textile sector, in particular for the small and medium-sized enterprises that make up the majority of the sector in the European Union. The SMEs have suffered significantly from the effects of the liberalisation of the market.
Furthermore, the import control system should be re-established, in particular with reference to Chinese imports, due to their volume. This is not at all a matter of promoting trade barriers. It is more a matter of compensating for the negative effects of this significant change. We should not forget that the European Union is the second-largest exporter in the world of textile products and clothing, which makes it necessary to guarantee optimum access to the markets of third countries. This is essential to the future of the textile and clothing industry in the European Union and in particular for SMEs.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I am going to try to put the questions very succinctly. My first point is the question of the European Union's special monitoring mechanism for textiles, which ended, as mentioned, on 31 December 2008. What is lacking, Commissioner, is the punctual and routine publication of statistical data on imports, exports and prices, as happens in the United States. Without these data, the European Union is prevented from reacting to any unfair practices and the Commission itself is incapable of defining its strategy. I would ask you to attend to this, as other Members have already done.
Thirdly, the European Union has launched an economic recovery plan to combat the current crisis. What role will commercial policy play in this context? What is the Commission preparing to do at this time, when a series of other countries, such as China, are starting to launch an increasing number of non-tariff barriers so that our European imports cannot access Chinese markets? What proposal does it have with regard to updating or adapting the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, as well as the aid available within the framework of the Structural Funds to improve the immediate situation of the European textile industry?
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what would you do, Commissioner, to speed up the opening of the Chinese and Indian markets? The main thing, of course, is that we should be able to export our products to those countries. Very many European companies have invested in China, building or acquiring factories there. That is why a more open market is really the top priority. What scope is there for you - in cooperation with Commissioner Kovács, where appropriate - to provide the textile industry with tax incentives, such as shorter depreciation periods, with a view to enhancing companies' creditworthiness? That would naturally help to safeguard jobs as well. When the Basel II Accord is implemented in the future, there will therefore be a need to have structures in place that serve to make firms more creditworthy.
Now I want to add something and inform the Commissioner that in fact she has the rather difficult task of resolving a certain dilemma. On one hand consumers of course want to buy cheaper products, in other words at a low price, irrespective of whether the goods come from China or from some other country, and on the other hand they must know that the cost of this may be that their own fellow citizens lose their jobs. Perhaps a campaign informing people of this will help you, as someone who supports finding a resolution to this dilemma, by asking questions and making proposals which will meet with the support of society. For this is about the consumer, and not only about the Commission.
(CS) Thank you, Madam President, I have just one brief remark on the whole complex subject of the textile industry and the impact of globalisation on it. I believe that it is probably wrong just to apply protective measures. The most important aspect is to raise the level of technology and the quality of production in Europe and to move the European textile industry forward by switching its structure into the field of speciality products and towards a level of quality which cannot be achieved by the Asian competition. This is a feasible option and some companies in Europe are already going down this route and creating new market segments, where they feel comfortable on the whole. I believe that such efforts should be Europe-wide in nature and require a well-considered concept.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me respond to a few of the points that have been made. A number of honourable Members - Mr Papastamkos, Mr Susta, Ms Ferreira, Mr Grau i Segú and Mr Zaleski - talked about the 'made in' proposition. I think the proposal the Commission has put forward is sound and should be adopted and that it is in the interests of business. However, as honourable Members know, I do not yet have a majority in the Council, and any support that honourable Members can give in getting that majority would be most welcome.
A number of interesting ideas were raised, such as impact assessments for industry, and I will feed those to my colleague Günter Verheugen. He well understands the importance of collecting data and statistics, but I will make sure that he hears of the concerns you have raised. We must look at all the initiatives on the table and how we deal with access to markets, as has been said. I would say to Mr Guerreiro that I accept absolutely the strategic importance of textiles and clothing and its value to the discussion we have had about accelerating markets.
The import of cheap textiles from China to Europe is a problem which has grown recently as a result of the gradual liberalisation in world trade. The Chinese textile industry, which has a cheap labour force of many millions at its disposal, has an obvious advantage over European producers, which specialise mainly in branded products. In relation to the progressive displacement of domestic production by more competitively priced imports from China, we can see negative social effects, which especially concern those regions that have for centuries specialised in the manufacture of clothes. As we are currently struggling with one of the most serious economic crises in history, the threat of impoverishment of large areas of the Community is even greater.
There can be no doubt that, as a result of the expiry of the agreement on bilateral monitoring at the end of 2008, immediate action is necessary to extend this system. It is also advisable to establish a high-level group within the EU, whose function would be to monitor the influx of Chinese textiles and inspect their quality. Bearing in mind that in the face of economic recession the protection of jobs should receive special attention from the governments of the Member States and the Commission, I appeal for the matter of the protection of the European textile market to be given priority status.
We have now managed to set up, at least in part of the Caribbean, an economic partnership agreement of this type, which we hope will be a success. My report states that this agreement will form a new basis for development cooperation: we are helping them to help themselves. We are trying to link together trade and development, by which I mean trade policy and development policy. There has, of course, been a certain amount of friction, in particular here in Parliament between our committee, the Committee on Regional Development, and the Committee on International Trade, relating primarily to the compatibility of this agreement with the rules of the WTO and especially the issue of parliamentary scrutiny.
My report originally included two paragraphs - numbers 5 and 17 - relating to parliamentary scrutiny. At the request and on the advice of the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, I deleted both of those paragraphs completely and submitted an alternative draft report with these paragraphs deleted, on which we will be voting on Thursday. Apart from the two deletions, my draft report is identical to the first draft. It sets out both the opportunities and the risks of the economic partnership agreements, but it particularly emphasises the potential positive effects of these agreements on the people in those countries.
Before I finish, Mr President, I would just like to say one more thing: some of our fellow Members have repeatedly claimed that people in the ACP States had too little time to conclude these agreements. That is not true: they had from 2000 to 2007; then they had another year until 2008; and we still have time. We are not, however, saying to people in these countries that they can do it whenever they like: time is running out. It is in the interests of the people in the ACP States, and I therefore call on all Members of this House to vote in favour of my report on Thursday, including those who originally intended to vote against it. This is not an argument between the left and the right; it is about helping people in the ACP States to become more self-confident and, in the foreseeable future, to become equal partners in international trade.
The dossier continues to evolve. We have signed a full Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean region, whilst we have negotiated interim agreements with countries and regions in Africa and the Pacific. These interim EPAs provide for a trade regime compatible with WTO rules and preserve important trade preferences for these countries. The interim agreements are only transitory in nature, as they will be replaced by full regional EPAs. The pace of these negotiations will be set by the regions concerned to ensure those objectives and coverage match their own integration processes, capacity, needs and political priorities.
The Commission recognises the essential role of development finance. At the same time we welcome the fact that the report acknowledges that the development objectives and outcomes of the agreements are a much wider issue than just financial support. We also recognise the essential role of reform in the ACP regions in reaching the development objectives, as set out in paragraph 14 of the report. This includes fiscal reform and changes to revenue systems. The reforms offset shifts in the tax base due to liberalisation and are in themselves valuable steps to ensuring sustainable public financing in the ACP.
Building up supply-side capacity to trade and engage in goods and service sectors underpins the economic value of a trade agreement. The Commission's view is that protectionism is never a valid policy option. However, we do acknowledge that protection - the legitimate use of measures to protect sensitive sectors and emerging industry - is a valid and essential policy tool. This is why the EPAs contain all sorts of flexibilities, and in particular exclusions and asymmetrical commitments for the ACP side, as called for in the report. On the EU side, our markets are completely open for ACP products, with increased cooperation to meet technical and health standards and facilitate trade. ACP countries will only open their markets gradually, with the possibility to maintain exceptions.
in writing. - (FR) On Thursday Parliament will give its verdict on Mr Schröder's report on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). I would be extremely disappointed if our institution's first vote on this both very technical and highly political subject (since the whole future of our relations with the ACP States is at stake) were to result in the adoption of Mr Schröder's report. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not vote in favour of this text, since it in no way reflects the concerns both of Europeans and of our ACP partners about the EPAs and the way in which they are negotiated.
In contrast to the rapporteur's position, the PSE Group has tabled and will vote in favour of a motion for a resolution which puts development back at the heart of the EPAs' priorities, which rejects the liberalisation of public services and any negotiation on the Singapore issues or on services against the ACP States' wishes, which promotes regional integration, which calls for huge financial support to bring the ACP States' economies up to standard, and which takes account of the specific characteristics and fragilities of these countries, be they least developed countries or otherwise.
Around 46% of the world's land mass can be considered a natural environment, a wilderness untouched by human civilisation. In Europe, however, wilderness makes up only 1% of the entire territory. We must do everything we can to ensure that at least the remaining wilderness, this 1%, is preserved for the sake of future generations. This is the aim of my report, and I hope that increased protection of wilderness zones will sooner or later be integrated into EU legislation. There is a dual perception of wilderness in European culture. On the one hand, it is viewed as a place to fear and avoid, where monsters and unknown dangers lie in wait for us, as is evoked in many folk tales. On the other hand, it is seen as an attractive, pleasant place that gives us temporary refuge from the stress of urban and industrial civilisation.
English-language literature on the topic makes a distinction between the concept of conservation, that is, the proper use of nature, and of preservation, in other words the protection of nature from all human use. These philosophical debates lie beyond the scope of my report, but for the record I would like to point out that I consider sustainable development to be the ideal solution. The wilderness cannot be locked up in a bank safety deposit box, like a necklace or a package of share certificates. We have a right to discover its values. Thus we must protect nature, but by means of human use.
The territory of Europe is too small to have zones that are off-limits to its citizens. Discovering nature and encountering conditions experienced by humanity before civilisation teaches respect for nature and can serve as the basis for high-quality tourism. At the same time, these areas are extremely vulnerable to environmental changes caused by human beings - for instance as a result of motorisation, chemicals and climate change - and to the appearance of alien plant and animal species. We need to be careful that visitors do not endanger the wilderness, and therefore all forms of tourism should be placed under the oversight of conservation experts. The development of sustainable tourism should be combined with the protection of these areas, and all proceeds should be devoted to wilderness protection.
The wilderness is a refuge for many species, such as the brown bear, the wolf and the lynx, which are unable to survive under even slightly altered conditions. There are still many species in Europe that are waiting to be discovered and described. Most of these live in the soil or in rotting timber and are highly sensitive to changes. These undisturbed areas are well-suited to the study of evolution, of natural changes occurring in nature. Wilderness zones are generally part of the Natura 2000 network, but they require stricter protection. My report therefore calls upon the European Commission to work with the Member States to map the remaining wilderness regions in Europe and develop a strategy for their increased protection. The natural values of the still-untouched areas and the characteristics of the habitats should be determined, and their further protection should be ensured. Experts have advised me that we should not think in terms of new legislation, but rather introduce more specific and stricter protection for wilderness zones within the Natura 2000 regulations. Since the financing of Natura 2000 is at any rate contradictory, and the source of much legitimate criticism, we will in any case have to make changes to the relevant regulations in the next parliamentary cycle but at the latest in the new budget. This could also be a good opportunity for the legal definition and enhanced protection of wilderness.
In December 2008, the Commission adopted the first comprehensive assessment of progress made at both European Community and Member State levels. Despite the positive developments that have been made in recent years - for instance the Natura 2000 network - the EU's biodiversity is still under continuous pressure due to habitat destruction, pollution, climate change and the impact of invasive species. The Commission's conclusion was that we are highly unlikely to meet our 2010 target of halting biodiversity decline - and that further intensive efforts will be required, both at Member State and EU levels.
Most of these areas are already a part of the Natura 2000 network. However, this report provides the inspiration to look again at the wild and nearly wild areas in the EU and to see if there are instances where additional European actions can help protect these special places. The Commission has commissioned a number of studies and is cooperating with the Czech EU Presidency. A conference will take place in Prague in May 2009. This Conference will offer a platform to consider the issues related to wilderness areas in Europe and identify measures needed to ensure their conservation.
In the PPE-DE Group we had a very vexed and heated argument both at working group and group level last week on the number of Rule 45(2) items on our agenda this week. I really do feel we need to urgently revisit this rule. I know it is a rule that was set by Parliament and the Members themselves signed off on, but our good will, I feel, is being abused by the number of points on our agenda - the most important points on our agenda - that we are being increasingly disallowed to debate.
But the increase in demand for wilderness tourism puts pressure on the very same values that the tourists are seeking and can speed up the destruction of fragile ecosystems. A solution would be to open a limited part of wilderness areas to high-quality sustainable tourism, which does not adversely affect the conservation objectives of the sites. Tourism activities should be allowed under strict conditions, such as a limited number of tourists per day, and on the basis of a solid sustainable tourism plan that supports conservation initiatives and promotes a responsible experience of wilderness. The tourism plans and the activities of the operators should be evaluated by means of thorough assessment mechanisms, especially designed for wilderness areas. The aim is to make tourists and operators aware that wilderness entails not only freedom but also responsibility.
Europe's biodiversity is the most precious legacy which we can leave future generations. I welcome and support this report on Europe's wilderness areas. I would like to draw attention to the alarming state of the area with the richest biodiversity in Europe, the Danube Delta. The Delta is being constantly subjected to acts of aggression from poaching, illegal economic interests and, last but not least, uncontrolled tourism. One of the biggest sources of aggression affecting the Delta is rooted in the lack of awareness of the Delta's populations and of rural populations living along the Danube's tributaries flowing through Romania.
The numbers speak for themselves: in business aviation alone, small and medium-sized enterprises working in this field are multiplying, the number of aircraft is expected to double to 3 500 in the next decade and annual turnover amounts to more than EUR 25 billion. Directly or indirectly, it generates 154 000 jobs across Europe. Together with general aviation, where it is calculated that there are between 30 000 and 50 000 aircraft, the sector represents around 9% of all recorded air traffic and boasts the fastest growth in Europe, twice as high as that of all other traffic.
Looking at the report itself, I agree, as rapporteur, with the need emphasised by the Commission in its communication to examine the specific needs of the sector and identify its central themes. The former relate to data collection and are based on the necessity of providing political decision-makers with sufficient data and statistical information to give them a better understanding of the sector so that they can regulate it adequately. The second point relates to the application of the principle of proportionality in regulating the sector. The key question is whether the rules designed to govern the operation of commercial aircraft will be adequate for operating simpler and smaller, often single-engine aircraft.
It is obvious that this initiative is worthy of full support. However, care should be taken that, in the processes of formulating and implementing policy, the needs of all categories of users of airspace and aviation infrastructure are given consideration in the planning and optimisation of capacity. In order to facilitate further reform a basic European data collection system should, however, be created for general and business aviation. Ultimately it will also be necessary to facilitate the access of this sector to foreign markets, supporting the development of new, competitive technologies, but at the same time taking care that respect is maintained for the principles of natural environment protection.
in writing. - I welcome this report for it seeks to harmonize and bring more clarity to the rules on General and Business Aviation on a community level. This is the fastest growing segment of civil aviation in Europe and it provides numerous social and economic benefits to Member States. However, to make the most of it, we need to establish the proper regulation. For example, currently there is a lack of reliable data on this sector and this deficiency must be quickly addressed for management, safety and security reasons.
in writing. - (PL) At a time when we keep hearing the word 'crisis', it is not easy to talk about the stable future of general and business aviation. I therefore thank Luís Queiró for taking the trouble to prepare the report on this subject. Congratulations. I am certain that it is air transport which can be a driving force, setting the world and European economy in motion. We remember that barely 106 years ago the Wright brothers made the world's first powered, controlled flight (although it was for barely 40 metres) in an aircraft. It was the beginning of true aviation.
Today aviation is a highly-developed industry, making 'flying machines' which are increasingly better equipped with an array of instruments. Aviation also includes the whole complicated field of navigation and flight control, building a ground-based airport infrastructure, a system of security, and so on. We should be aware that in Europe about 50 000 aircraft are in use in general and business aviation, and almost four times as many small aircraft and gliders are used for sport and recreation. These numbers speak for themselves.
rapporteur. - Mr President, it is particularly appropriate that Mrs Reding is responding for the Commission tonight because my report is focused on a proposal that has been developed over a number of years with her services. It is an extremely important proposal, which has wide-ranging possibilities for the whole of the European economy. My first message to the Commissioner tonight is to thank her services for their leadership on this, but to say that I think this initiative needs to be much better known. It needs to spread out widely from DG Information Society - as I think it is now starting to do - because it is of such importance, particularly in the economic times we are in at the moment.
So, what am I talking about? Well, the core of the issue is that public authorities in the European Union spend huge amounts of public money on buying products and services. It is estimated that EUR 1 800 billion is spent on public procurement every year. How much of that procurement is actually spent on investigating, researching and encouraging the development of new solutions to the big challenges that public authorities and indeed society face every day: a better health service, a better transport solution, dealing with climate change, more energy efficient buildings? EU procurement spending linked to research and development is less than 1% of that total procurement budget.
That is where the whole mission of pre-commercial procurement comes in. Essentially, what we are looking for are intelligent, research-focused public authorities to generate a demand for innovative solutions and then work with innovative companies large and small - but particularly small enterprises who really can benefit from this - to fulfil those requirements. We want those intelligent customers to really think ahead, to be demanding, to think about the solutions for which no commercial solution yet exists, but where there are basically a range of solutions which can then be developed with the financial contribution from the public authority to do just that - to fund research and development, perhaps through a first competing stage of ideas, and then take those development solutions to a next stage towards the viability of a product or service that can then be launched.
This also ties in with the second initiative from the Commission covered in my report, the 'lead market initiative', where we are looking for public authorities to lead in a number of key technology areas around health and climate change in transport. There are signs of an integrated policy emerging, but my report says that we need more training, we need more best practice, and we need more dispersion and dissemination of this proposal. I hope that the Commissioner, and indeed the College, will pick up on this and that this Parliament will show it is right behind this solution.
In conclusion - and if you will allow me a short amount of extra time because this is, in a sense a point of order - I want to point out first of all to this empty House that I had two opinions for my report from Mr Sakalas from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mrs Podimata from the Committee on Industry. They are of course not allowed to present those opinions here, which seems rather a shame since they made valuable contributions which I have added to my amendments. I also want to thank my shadow, Mr Hasse Ferreira, for working with me, and he has also contributed extensively.
I am very glad that the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, together with the Commission, has supported what has been in the pipeline for quite a long time. But there is a difference between being in the pipeline and being put into practice. I really hope that Parliament's report will become a trigger and an important element to add to our research and innovation policy. Indeed, triggering a strong public-sector demand for the development of new innovative products and services in Europe can make a difference, especially for our SMEs, and that is why I welcome the initiative. I congratulate Mr Harbour on his work.
The suggestions contained in the report will help us to implement this proposal. Most of the report's contents should find a place in the new framework decision, but if this proves not to be possible, for technical or legal reasons, we will try to identify the most suitable tools to implement any proposals left out of this framework decision. We will see if there is a possibility for political initiatives, particularly to use dialogue with third countries, or even to provide ourselves with financial instruments, as is the case for the existing programmes.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new proposal submitted by the Commission is urgently needed. The members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality have specific questions and suggestions relating to the proposal. It is essential that we go beyond the confines of the Daphne Programme and introduce legislative initiatives in the area of child pornography. Of course, this is also the responsibility of the users, but the states must take action. For example, I believe that Europol is an important tool which, combined with an effective network of experts and a special unit whose members have had training on very specific issues, can be used to combat child pornography and prostitution. We must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by taking a joint European approach.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Europol's organised crime report of 2006 stated that the advantages the Internet offers in terms of information and communication technology are extremely beneficial to organised crime. There is no doubt, in this regard, that children are the most vulnerable group. According to experts, around 90% of 12 to 17 year-olds chat on the Internet. Besides classmates and games, they use 'unknown user' networks via chat rooms on websites, which are perfect contact points for paedophiles using false identities to lure potential victims.
We are witnessing a well-organised international network of paedophiles and organised crimes connected with the sex industry, as stated by Mrs Angelilli. On the other side, the international cooperation of law enforcement authorities is limited. It is almost incredible that eight ratifications are still missing in the case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; four in the case of the Palermo Protocol, which is the basic document for international cooperation in combating trafficking in human beings. Slightly less than half of the Member States have still not ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
The third proposal is that we should now seriously tackle the Internet and, together with the largest credit companies, develop the technical means, with the help of banks and exchange bureaux, Internet service providers and search engine providers and, of course, the travel industry, to close down payment systems when payment is made for sex crimes and violations or the sexual exploitation of children and young people. The same opinions are found everywhere where people are striving to get websites closed down and that is that children come before confidentiality and that the abuse of children and young people must be reported.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts and her initiative on this report. Protecting children while they are using the Internet and combating child pornography are two of the most urgent issues which we have to deal with. For me, it is very important to ensure that this Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography offers a higher level of protection. The abuse of children over the Internet can only be handled as a joint initiative at a European level, because the Internet is not subject to national boundaries.
There are three points in this report which I believe are in need of improvement. Firstly, a balance must be maintained between children's security and data protection. We must take into consideration not only children's personal data, but also the personal data of people and content which is relevant for the purpose of providing this protection for children. As well as creating criminal offences for Internet users and suppliers of child pornography, we must first identify the people behind these dreadful activities and arrest them. We can only combat this abuse successfully by attacking it at the roots. We must also target those people who make these services, these appalling criminal activities, available to others and who profit from them.
As well as criminalising the offenders, as described in Mrs Angelilli's report, we must also raise awareness among people who look after children and explain the risks involved in Internet use. We must focus on developing new technological methods and establishing the principle of privacy by design. In addition, we must promote the exchange of information and experiences between the individual authorities in the Member States. The data protection authorities in the Member States can act as important intermediaries in this respect. Only an all-embracing approach will be successful.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Ms Angelilli for this report. I would echo what has been said by our colleague, Ms Bauer, in terms of our own Member States taking action to sign and ratify some of the conventions and protocols which are missing at the moment. If we are looking for a common framework and a common approach, these are very key reference points which also help to send a signal from Member States that they, too, are concerned about these issues. I think this is one of the key things they should be doing, and it would be interesting to know why certain Member States have not yet actually signed up to the relevant conventions and protocols.
We welcome much of the report in terms of the rights-based approach, which I would like to see leading on and away from the view that it is only about criminal justice. This is actually about the rights and the protection of children and young people. We need those clear measures to support children who have been victims - whether through court proceedings, where obviously the key issue is to find the truth but not in a way that leaves children more traumatised than they were at the beginning of the process, or through the collective work on identifying children.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) This report has the support of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. The sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are abhorrent crimes, the prevention of which requires international cooperation. Children are violated by being forced to pose in sexual contexts, photographed or filmed and posted on the Internet. These films and images can be seen all over the world and increased international cooperation is therefore needed to stop these violations. We know that there are definite connections between the sex slave trade and the sexual exploitation of children. The United Nations estimates that 85% of the victims of the sex slave trade are children under the age of 18.
We should, however, exercise caution when it comes to prescribing detailed sentences for this abuse at European level. The Member States themselves will need to make every effort to penalise the abuse of modern media. Internet child porn will need to be regulated in the Member States' criminal law. The Council should, in line with the prohibition against pursuing one's profession, commit to closing the loopholes in the legal network, so that exploitation and transmission via the Internet do not move to countries where there is no adequate legislation. I would have liked to hear from the Commission whether it would also be possible to discuss this with non-EU countries, but the Council is absent, unfortunately.
It is an outrage that there are thousands of people who have been charged with child pornography offences and have spent not so much as a single day in prison. I would also like to remind the rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, the quality of whose work we have all admired, that in her city last year, there was a case known as 'Lotus flower', involving 200 Roma children. Once the case was over, these Roma children virtually disappeared; no one knows whether they in fact went back to the same camps where the abuse took place.
(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House is debating a topic today which rightfully outrages all people of good will. We condemn the phenomenon, and then believe that such trauma can only happen to other people's children. Yet all our children are in danger, as the victims of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography multiply. We must therefore fight to prevent such acts using all available means. We must ensure that the sanctions laid down in national legal systems are effectively applied, and that daily practice reflects this struggle. Member States must do everything possible to eliminate demand entirely.
We must be particularly vigilant regarding the constant challenge posed by the use of new online technologies - web cams, mobile phones and, in particular, the use of the Internet - in this regard. The introduction of technologies that block access can be one way of doing this, besides making families and children aware of the dangers. In any case, we must emphasise that these are serious crimes, and that in order to detect them, it is essential to remove any obstacles in the way of the smooth exchange of law enforcement records among Member States, to allow the creation of centralised databases for information on offenders.
With this recommendation, we advocate that real steps be taken: we request European harmonisation of differences in the age of consent; tougher punishments for sexual abuse; and stronger, increased national intervention programmes and systems. To achieve this, we must focus attention on Member States so that - as Spain has done, beyond transposing the Council's framework decision on this matter, - we can develop and implement action plans in which interest groups are involved, including public awareness and social mobilisation programmes, without neglecting to work on international cooperation.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli on her exceptional work on such a sensitive issue which concerns us all. The sexual exploitation of children is a phenomenon which continues to shock society in the Member States of the European Union and elsewhere. Child pornography on the Internet is a worsening problem if you think that, between 1997 and 2007, the number of websites showing the sexual exploitation of children increased one thousand per cent. Reinforced cooperation with the private sector could make an effective contribution towards limiting the number of websites hosting child pornography. For example, cooperation could be promoted with credit card companies to fight child pornography on the Internet at European level by using their systems for payments to commercial sites selling photographs of children.
In addition, the new Community programme to protect children using the Internet will help to promote a safer online environment. The Council of Europe Convention signed by 20 Member States of the European Union is the first international legal act qualifying the various forms of sexual exploitation of children as a criminal offence. In order to deal effectively with this phenomenon, Member States need to criminalise every form of coercion of children to take part in sexual activities. Finally, I consider it very important to take account of paedophile registers and to prohibit them from accessing jobs or voluntary work which brings them into direct contact with minors.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around the world, some 40 million children under the age of 12 are the victims of some form of violent act. Given that the new technologies and, in particular, the constant development of the Internet and the new online methods used by paedophiles, it is of paramount importance that the level of child protection be increased. According to Eurobarometer, 74% of underage children use the Internet on a daily basis, and hence many of them are exposed to violent or pornographic elements.
In the interests of effective protection, I would like to recommend the introduction of the so-called free family information packages in Europe. These are already widely used by certain European Internet service providers, and I believe that others can also become partners in this effort. The packages address four basic safety topics - safety and communication, entertainment, downloading, and virtual violence, and, in a playful manner, offer families help with the safe use of the Internet. I further recommend that these packages contain a free, child-friendly Internet browser which could serve as a web filter, to keep children away from undesirable content on the World Wide Web. We must be sure that our children are safe, not only on the Internet, but in public and private institutions as well. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that everyone whose work involves regular contact with children be required to report any situation in which sexual abuse has occurred. Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, I am very pleased that Parliament has taken up the question of combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography seriously. I am especially pleased because, until now, many left-wing groups in Europe have been fighting openly for the greatest possible sexual freedom, while not giving attention to the consequences of this course of action in relation to children. There have even been attempts to form paedophile political parties. This must fill every decent citizen of the European Union with horror. The scale of this phenomenon is huge, as can be seen just by looking through the daily papers.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that child sex offenders have a high repeat offence rate. To some extent, the adage of our German friends, einmal ist keinmal, applies here. However, if somebody commits such an offence two or more times, then we should be able to prevent them from committing further crimes. In such cases, both therapeutic and various preventive measures should be used, particularly bans on working with children and adolescents. Since extended periods of time can lapse between offences being repeated, information on tendencies to commit such crimes should be kept on record over the long term. I would also recommend the compulsory vetting of persons applying to work as teachers, coaches and youth supervisors for past sex offences.
The fact is that the Internet now provides new routes for these crimes, and I therefore think it is incumbent on us to urge that the acts of using the Internet for child pornography and for grooming children be made a criminal offence. It is not enough for states to plead that this is difficult to do. We have to cooperate and coordinate our efforts in order to ensure we can do it. Indeed, in all Member States, it should be possible for any citizen or person living in the European Union who committed a crime outside the European Union to be brought before the courts.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen: the 2003 framework decision aimed to narrow the legislative gap between Member States in combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. To this end, it adopted a common framework of provisions to regulate, amongst other things, criminalisation, the applicable sanctions and protection of and assistance to victims. I consider it regrettable that some Member States have yet to adopt the measures necessary for the implementation of this framework decision, even though the deadline for them to do so has already passed.
It is essential that all Member States criminalise all types of sexual abuse of children and that all European citizens who commit a sex crime against children in any country within or outside the European Union be subject to uniform extraterritorial criminal legislation applicable throughout the Union. It is important to ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes cannot slip through the law's fingers. I also support the revision of the framework decision so that it guarantees at least the same level of protection as the 2007 Council of Europe Convention. It is regrettable that some Member States have yet to sign this Convention.
I therefore thank Mrs Angelilli for her report. I have raised this subject many times myself. Prophylactic and preventative measures are needed in this area. It is essential to raise awareness of the dangers, both among children and also among their parents and carers. Rapid crime detection and strict enforcement of penalties are imperative. Cooperation is needed from the media. These measures must include the whole world, because in some countries there are organisations which question the penalising of sexual contact with children. Indeed, there are even specious notions about so-called 'good paedophilia.' We should not be indifferent to the degradation of our children, or to their pain and humiliation. This is a reproach of our times.
(EL) Mr Vice-President, the recommendation presented so perfectly today by Mrs Angelilli and supported by my fellow members is directed mainly at the Council. However, as you said that you would be tabling your own proposal in March, I should like to ask for this proposal to be in keeping with numerous policies of the European Union and not move in just one direction. This proposal will need to make provision for criminalisation, strict measures and cooperation with Europol, whose convention is the first to mention trafficking in human beings. Let us not forget that, apart from the threats, violence, deception and abuse of dependents, especially within the family, we also have exploitation from deliberate promotion, mainly of people at an age at which they cannot react. I refer to the phenomenon of trafficking in abandoned infants which we have seen emerging on the Internet and, when I say Internet, I mean not just the World Wide Web and the chatrooms which children enter from their bedrooms, but also the numerous other means, including mobiles, which children can use, which is why we need to make provision for all the parameters.
When we talk about a criminal offence, we also need to think about the situation in correctional facilities and prisons. If we cut down on the number of people in these institutions, we have an increased risk of such phenomena. Provision also needs to be made for improving the living conditions of victims. We need to protect victims and their families, given that violence by abusers is spreading and the means which they use are stronger than the means of defence available to victims, because they are mainly economic. I trust therefore that your new proposal will feature a stronger level of protection for minors and high-specification means.
I live in a small village, where people know each other and are interested in what is happening around them. A stranger arouses interest. In a small village in the south of Poland it would be difficult for someone to make contact with the children unnoticed, but I venture to say that in just such peaceful and safe places all over Europe, when the parents are quietly reading the newspaper or watching television, an unwanted stranger is in their children's bedroom, and has made contact with them over the Internet. Are we, as parents, helpless? No, we are not. Perhaps our children are more proficient in using the new technologies. Perhaps it is difficult to get them away from their computers.
Dear parents, do something today to protect your children. Remind them of something we were taught, namely: 'do not talk to strangers.' It is such a simple message. Today, those strangers are not lurking outside the school with a bag of sweets, they enter Internet chat rooms and seek their victims there. They are more dangerous, because we do not see when they slip without difficulty from one child's bedroom to another. We should teach our children that they must not talk to strangers, and likewise on the Internet, shut the door in their face.
We cannot allow to otherwise ignore the fact that prevention of this phenomenon is part of the battle against it: to educate children and parents how to avoid coming into contact with this phenomenon and with the people involved in it; to limit all types of advertising which provoke open and aggressive sexuality; that there is more concern for children in various institutions, who often become victims of sexual violence; integrating efforts for averting child trafficking - one of the main reasons for trafficking is namely sexual exploitation; and to form networks consisting of non-government and government structures as a countermeasure.
I further ask them to name publicly those Member States that have deficient legislation in this respect. One measure I suggest should be considered is the establishment of a pan-European - or even better, international - public list of offenders convicted of sexual offences against children. I propose that such a listing should be permanent, with no possibility of anyone's name being erased from it unless there has been a court decision reversing the original conviction. A sexual offence against a child causes permanent damage to the victim and should also result in permanent labelling of the perpetrator. This will be an additional measure of punishment, but will also act as a prevention measure.
Developments in science and technology and in new methods of communication, and especially the Internet and mobile telephony, have also revealed a new way of luring children into sexual exploitation, as well as a new way of distributing child pornography. The introduction of penalties for this kind of activity under the criminal law of all Member States is essential. However, the introduction of criminal responsibility for such acts is not sufficient. Another imperative is the establishment of systems which will prevent situations in which the danger of sexual exploitation of a child would be possible, such as by the education of parents and children, and also by tracking down paedophile organisations which are active on the Internet.
(CS) Madam President, I welcome this report with just two reservations. Firstly, I do not believe that prosecuting parents who coerce their children into forced marriages is effective. Realistically, it is impossible to prove this within a family where there is also an exceptional right to remain silent. Secondly, the provision on overriding professional confidentiality would need to be worked out in more detail. Regardless of these two reservations, I appeal to the Member States, the Council and the Commission, including the Czech Presidency, to urgently update the relevant European and national legislation and to ratify international agreements for effectively combating paedophilia. A Europe-wide database of paedophiles must be set up as soon as possible to prevent these people from being employed in education or child services in other Member States. The age limit for sexually motivated crime should also be harmonised. I would also like to point out that Member States need to finance the development and expansion of programmes which will help parents to protect their children from Internet grooming.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say to Parliament that it is not enough to have a good legal framework. There is also a need for tools. This is why, at European level, around Europol, we are trying to build a platform which can be used to bring together information gathered in the Member States and distribute reports and statistics from the national platforms. Several EU countries have such platforms, but now there is a need at Community level to ensure that everyone can be familiar with all this information. In this matter, the European Union can offer added value, provided that we can succeed in creating this platform around Europol.
I would also say that we have a further tool in which I have a lot of faith, in other words, the informal public-private group created by the Commission, which has introduced a European financial coalition against commercial child pornography images. In the face of a quadrupling in the number of sites between 2003 and 2007, we have to involve the private sector, as it controls a large part of the IT infrastructures. In particular, the access providers have to be mobilised. This is fundamental.
Moreover, I would point out that children are, in fact, those with the greatest need for privacy and data protection. Mr Barrot mentioned this too: often during legal proceedings, when a scandal breaks in which the victim is sadly a child, it is precisely the exploited child that is fed to the media without any form of protection, and I would say without any compassion either for their image or for their privacy, and all simply to boost television ratings and sell a few more newspapers. I would also like to add that no child is exempt from these dangers, and unaccompanied children and Roma children are often even more vulnerable.
In order to prevent crimes, one must increase awareness. The 2008 Eurobarometer study shows that a large percentage of parents do not pay attention to what their children are doing on the Internet. I, for instance, represent a country where Internet use is among the highest in the EU, but parents' disregard is also among the highest in the EU. Namely, 60% of them are not concerned that their children might fall victim to harassment; 47% are not concerned that their children see pornography or violent material; 62% are not concerned that their children may divulge personal data.
- Madam President, on a point of order, I refer to Rule 142(2)(a) and (b) on the allocation of speaking time. Yesterday when we were discussing the Guantánamo prison, here in the Chamber, I and several other speakers were interrupted without mercy when we had exceeded our speaking time by a few seconds. That harsh treatment was meted out by Mr Pöttering and Mr Siwiec, the Vice-President replacing him later in the afternoon.
Mr Schulz, the Socialist Group leader, on the other hand, was permitted by Mr Pöttering to exceed his time limit by far more than a minute. Now, I would not dream of insinuating that this was because Mr Pöttering and Mr Schulz are buddies - alte Kameraden as one might put it in German - but I do spot a recurring pattern here. Colleagues from big groups elaborating the political message the Chair wants to hear are treated with great generosity. Colleagues from smaller groups elaborating the political message the Chair does not want to hear are treated with great meanness. Now that is in breach of the Rules of Procedure, where it is clearly stated how speaking time should be allocated.
Let us take a brief look at the history. We had the BSE crisis and, in 1997, the Temporary Committee of Inquiry issued its final report in which Parliament called for this open declaration. The Commission presented a proposal, which subsequently became Directive 2002/2/EC. In a compromise with the Council - this went through all the bodies - the Directive pushed through the open declaration, which meant that labels had to state the ingredients with a ± 15% tolerance, and the exact composition had to be provided on request.
That was a directive rather than a regulation, and Member States implemented it only very hesitantly or not at all. The feed industry brought an action to the European Court of Justice, and the Court gave the following first-class confirmation: apart from the exact information, the legality of this Directive was not in dispute. We then took account of this judgment in a further procedure in Parliament, and have now brought matters to a conclusion in the form of this Regulation. I had the honour of being rapporteur each time and, throughout this long period, I enjoyed extremely intensive cooperation with the Commission that was based on trust.
Today we have a result that has been fought for hard but fairly, and of which we can be proud. It is also apparent that it enjoys the support of the majority in this House and of the groups. There are no amendments, from which I conclude that this Regulation will indeed be adopted by a large majority. Therefore, we have a good Regulation that brings about the open declaration in three steps - you know what they are - firstly, the components in descending percentage order; secondly, the provision of information to feed businesses with a ± 15% tolerance - in this regard we have not laid down a reservation of intellectual property rights in this legislation, but rather referred to the general legislation - and thirdly, the provision of exact information to the authorities.
The compromise package maintains the high level of feed safety achieved in the EU. It strikes the right balance between consumer protection and intellectual property rights. It removes the burden of the pre-market authorisation procedure for bio-proteins, modernises the labelling of feed through proper information for the customer and places coregulation at the heart of legislative procedures. It improves market transparency through the notification system for new feed materials, facilitates innovation and competitiveness in the EU feed business and marks a concrete step against the misleading of feed users - be they farmers or pet owners.
What matters most is for the intellectual property of the cattle feed manufacturers to be safeguarded. If we in the sector want innovation - as indeed, yesterday, we voted on a climate report - there is much room for improvement in the cattle feed sector too, so that the emission of all kinds of gases caused by livestock can be reduced. Well, this is a challenge we need to confront squarely. When cattle feed manufacturers decide to innovate, they should not be impeded by excessively strict legislation on disclosure. This disclosure is, to my mind, safeguarded, as others have already mentioned, and could be done at the request of the government or a certain customer, for example. There is nothing stopping the cattle feed manufacturers from doing this on a voluntary basis.
The ingredients as such are not the most important thing: the precise nutritional value of cattle feed is much more important, and should be correctly labelled. Everything that is on the label, such as energy, protein, and suchlike, is valuable information. In short, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will be backing this compromise. We will also say to the cattle feed manufacturers that if they wish to innovate in their production processes and their cattle feed composition, for example, this is a good compromise that will help them do this.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I will be no exception in offering my congratulations to my group colleague, Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, who has worked very hard on what must be one of the more technical dossiers we have dealt with. He has also displayed the wisdom of Solomon in striking a balance between the needs of the consumers and the very legitimate needs of manufacturers for the protection of their product and their intellectual property.
This is what I would call back home one of the more classic European Parliament dossiers. Looking at our guests in the visitors' gallery, it is pretty safe to say that animal feed labelling is probably not one of the most glamorous subjects they could have heard us talking about today, but it is crucially important and it is a real example of where this Parliament adds value, and where we can ensure our consumers', our citizens' and our voters' faith in the food chain of the food they eat.
The access of animal feed users to information about the contents of the feed will still be limited by the protection of intellectual property rights. If the producer of a feedstuff uses a dangerous ingredient, we will still be vulnerable. The problem of feedstuffs is further proof of the mistaken direction being taken by agricultural policy which, in spite of declarations, supports industrial agriculture first and foremost and, in such agriculture, farmers do not have to have their own feedstuffs and can raise animals using feedstuffs produced by specialised businesses. These businesses are, of course, profit-driven and will always find a way to reduce costs, but will not necessarily take into account the safety of animals or our health. As a consequence, we have to multiply specific provisions and increase monitoring, which takes the matter to an absurd level.
Is it not time to reverse these tendencies and to return to the sustainable development of agriculture, in which farmers will have their own feedstuffs and will not be exposed to the losses caused by dioxins or BSE? Progress in agriculture does not have to mean the concentration of production or the concentration of feedstuff production. We should bear in mind that in the EU, we currently have 15 million farms, and as many as 95% of these are small and medium-sized farms. Most of these farms can use the sustainable model of agriculture for the good of farmers, the environment and of us all. We only need to radically change our approach to agriculture, and in doing so to change our approach to current common agricultural policy.
(FR) Mr President, what is good about animals is that the years go by and the problems remain the same. For example, we always mention jaw traps when talking about wild animals, and the question of transport, breeding and feed always arises in relation to farm animals. Animal feed is a classic case; it is a mishmash, a load of rubbish. Antibiotics, clenbuterol, growth hormones, even the remains of other animals, are used, and this is what the United Kingdom's contaminated feed problem from the 1990s was all about.
And then there remains the big question of imported feed, namely raw materials that have been arriving from the American continent since the 1960s. In the 1960s, this came in the form of corn gluten feed - molasses, oilseed residues - and, today, it is in the form of transgenic soya from Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, and transgenic maize from Canada and the United States. And this, dare I say it, because people are against local GMOs, but not immigrant GMOs.
Food safety in the EU has been shaken by many crises in recent years, such as BSE and several dioxin scandals, the latest of which apparently occurred last autumn. The causes of the crises have often been found to be contaminated feed, due to negligence or even criminal activity. This regulation to simplify and clarify legislation is welcome. The regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the European food chain. Consumers need to be protected and they must be able to tell where and how the food they buy has been produced.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few years ago in Italy, it was claimed that foodstuffs mixed in the shed by farmers were to be considered as feed, and thus the sheds were to be considered as feed factories. Agricultural producers would never have been able to comply with complex health regulations, HACCP and traceability, and would therefore have been forced to purchase from real feed factories the foodstuffs that had been made on the farm for centuries. At the time, we managed to avoid this snare.
The report that we are debating today defines feed but not feed factories. So that Europe does not get the blame once again, it must be crystal clear that foodstuffs for livestock, mixed on the premises of the livestock company, does not constitute feed, but simply extemporaneous mixing of foodstuffs and raw materials produced directly in the fields, and that the agricultural business is not a feed factory. Perhaps it is a partisan position, but one can never be too careful when interpretations have considerable economic significance.
(NL) I should like to echo all the compliments that have already been paid to our rapporteur. Needless to say, public and animal health should be at the heart of cattle feed legislation. This translates into clear rules regarding the use and labelling of raw materials. This should, of course, remain workable and not lead to a greater administrative burden or, as has already been mentioned, jeopardise the manufacturers' intellectual property. We will continue to monitor this with a critical eye, but it looks as if the new regulation will meet these requirements.
I should like to make an observation with regard to inspection. Once again, effective controls and sanctions to separate the wheat from the chaff will make or break this legislation. The regulation stipulates that the penalties which the Member States may apply themselves must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. I would urge the European Commission to closely monitor the situation in the near future, to make sure this is the case in all the countries of the European Union. It is, after all, unacceptable for one country to be stricter than another. An excellent case in point is, to my mind, the suspended sentences that were given this week, ten years after the event, in the Belgian dioxin scandal.
Finally, I should like to mention a topic that cannot remain untouched, namely meat and bone meal. Following the emotional speech of the first speaker from the Non-Attached Members, I shall confine myself to the facts. Meat and bone meal in animal feed has been banned since the BSE crisis. However, in the case of chickens, for example, this leads to a shortage of animal protein in their feed, quite apart from the fair criticism that valuable proteins are destroyed. Moreover, animal feed is the largest overhead for the five million cattle farmers in the European Union who have not got it easy to begin with.
Of course, we do not want to revert back to a situation in which animal proteins from within the same species end up in the feed. Cannibalism: never again! We need to put tests in place in order to handle this situation properly. The European Commission has indicated that these tests could be available in 2009, which means that meat and bone meal could be reintroduced in the feed of chickens or pigs, for example, in a safe manner. I should like to find out from the European Commission what the latest is on this score and what steps we can expect in this respect in the coming year.
For products of animal origin to be of good quality, good quality feedstuffs are essential - this is the most important factor - as well as suitable living conditions for the animals. Most of the ingredients of feedstuffs are produced by agriculture itself, but the additives which are used are most often chemical products. It is these which create the most controversy. Therefore, we should fight for the exact composition of industrial feedstuffs to be declared. It has nothing to do with intellectual property rights and their protection. Only when a patent office grants a protection certificate is a product protected.
When they have not been tested sufficiently, new animal feed additives may be harmful to our health, although they ensure the best growth or the best appearance of the product. A farmer does not have the facilities to test feedstuffs and can only rely on information supplied by the producer. We should remember BSE and the results of adding meat and bone meal to animal feeds. Industry will do everything for profit. This is why I support Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report in its entirety.
I should like to reiterate my conviction that businesses that also process food to make feed should be subject to better scrutiny, that the HACCP concept should be required as a basis for authorisation - possibly for authorisation throughout Europe - as that has also been a problem in both yesterday's and today's debates. We need the same controls for the same risks throughout the European Union. Although we can never rule out abuses, this report and also yesterday's debate have laid good foundations for safety without going over the top. This is another point made in today's report, of course: that we have learned from developments following the BSE crisis, and that we now know that quite a few things can - and must - be done differently.
(FR) Mr President, the excellent report by our fellow Member - whom I congratulate - on which we are going to vote today, is important because the European animal feed sector is one of our main agricultural sectors, both in terms of production, since it accounts for half of the agricultural production within the European Union - 120 million tonnes - and of turnover - around EUR 50 billion. Within the European Union, there are, in fact, 5 million farmers and 60 million pet-owning households.
In the past, the European Union has come to terms with a number of health crises, which means that, today, we have to be more vigilant with regard to transparency, in order to meet the expectations not only of farmers, but also of consumers. The provisions laid down in this report have the advantage of representing a minimal cost for the industries and a great benefit for consumers, who are paying more and more attention to the quality of the goods they buy. Adopting this report will make it possible to limit the risks by guaranteeing better quality goods, better monitoring, more traceability, and better information for farmers and, therefore, ultimately, for consumers.
We do indeed need transparency, and have to know what is in compound feed - there is no doubt about that. I have no problem with a company keeping its intellectual property rights confidential. However, recent events in the Republic of Ireland, with the dioxin problem, bring home very clearly to all of us the need for control. Farmers can have the highest possible standards of livestock husbandry and do everything right but, as we have witnessed, all can be lost when events way beyond their control destroy all their good and hard work.
Secondly, is it not long past the time for reference points for action, or RPAs, for dealing with the adventitious presence of minuscule levels of GMO in feed, rather than the present zero-tolerance regime, which results in criminally disproportionate waste of feed and cereal shipments and criminally disproportionate sanctions? I refer, of course, to the presence of previously authorised GMs by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), so that they are fully risk-assessed by definition, or perhaps a GMO that is fully authorised in another jurisdiction.
This report has been a long haul. As we know, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment, which was followed by clean, fair discussion. We had opportunity to discuss this at length and, as rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has shown that a satisfactory solution can be achieved in a short space of time even as part of a first reading agreement. I have crossed swords with him a fair few times since 1994, but our teamwork has always been fair, and I should like to thank him once again for his work.
On the subject of whether criminal activity can be prevented, this report cannot do so, of course, but the improved intensity of controls it provides may deter such activity. Criminal activity always focuses where it sees an opportunity, where it sees loopholes, and we have now been able to close these in some areas. I hope - as Mr Nicholson said - that both the feed industry and farmers will understand that there is something to be defended here, that a community is being formed against these attempts to dispose of toxic substances via feed. I am fairly sure that this will also curb criminal activity.
Let me conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs. Here, too, there were arguments, of course - after all, we hold different opinions in this House - but I believe that what we subsequently created now has everyone's support. I should also like to thank our committee's administrative team - in this case Mr Emmes - who did outstanding groundwork. Although we Members of the European Parliament always play a leading role in the political field, in the administrative field we do need to be able to fall back on this groundwork. Here, too, this was very successful.
I should like to add that, when we have codecision, parliamentarianism is fun. It was always said that codecision in agriculture would make everything much more complicated and time-consuming. This is not true, as we have seen that, given good work, a good understanding of matters, good groundwork and good political opponents, things can be staged very quickly. I think that this is proof that the expertise of the European Parliament can serve, and help, to set good legislation in motion.
The country's ethnic diversity both justifies and reinforces this dictatorship. In large areas, minority peoples are in the majority. They pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship. The military leaders consider their dictatorship necessary to be able to keep the country together permanently and to subjugate the rebellious people. They are more interested in the territory than in the people who live in it. By issuing major exploitation concessions to foreign businesses, vital sources of income are taken from the indigenous people, with nature and the environment being seriously damaged in the process.
The need to flee the country is further reinforced by the fact that no consideration is given to the regional majority peoples. The regime is keen to eliminate troublesome groups, either by killing them or by chasing them out of the country. Many flee into the sea in makeshift dinghies, running the considerable risk of drowning. Burma's neighbour, Thailand, has seen many refugees cross the border: according to some estimates, as many as two million people have fled over the past 25 years, and tens of thousands who have been refused entry remain homeless in the no man's land along the border.
author. - Madam President, this case highlights the plight of a minority in a country where minorities are at best marginalised and at worst brutalised. The Rohingya people have suffered double discrimination for years. As Muslims, they are being denied the right to practise their faith freely, a right that we in the EU recognise as fundamental, and their mosques have been damaged and desecrated. As an ethnic minority, the Rohingya people are systematically denied civil rights that most of the rest of the world take for granted: the right to marry, the right to move freely, the right to citizenship of the country they live in, and the right to a proper education.
The appalling fate of the little-known-about Rohingya people, especially those fleeing by boat as refugees that are the subject of this resolution, has renewed our attention on the despotic regime in Burma, a country so rich in human potential otherwise. The brutality of the military junta stands in stark contrast to the action of Thailand, which has only partially, in my view, discharged its responsibility for the Rohingya refugees as it unfortunately alleges that most of them are purely economic refugees which I believe to be highly unlikely, and tried sending them back. Thailand must take more seriously its growing role as a force for stability and humanity in the region.
Amongst these destitute people are the indigenous Rohingya community of Western Burma who, in recent years, have been the victims of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Burmese Government. Unfortunately, the Thai authorities have not provided those refugees with the humanitarian assistance they so clearly deserve. Instead, it is reported that these people have been fiercely persecuted. We call on the Thai Government to respect the human rights of Burmese refugees and to treat them with respect, compassion, dignity and humanity.
This resolution also gives me the opportunity to deal with the issue of the 41-year-old Australian writer of Cypriot origin, Harry Nicolaides, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in Thailand for allegedly insulting the country's Royal Family in a novel he wrote in 2005. Mr Nicolaides was teaching English at a Thai university at the time, and in his novel he only makes an anonymous reference to a member of the Thai Royal Family, and the incriminated work is clearly fictitious.
Thailand has said it is unwilling to grant that, but that is a problem that will not go away. There are ongoing reports of the treatment of Burmese refugees who enter Malaysia. Many of these people are sold as slaves, the women and children are forced into sexual slavery and the men are sold as forced labour onto fishing vessels. Some of this fish may even enter the EU market. I hope that today, we can highlight the plight of Burmese refugees and particularly the plight of the Rohingya.
In this respect, I noted during my visit that both Thailand and the international community have assumed a disturbing attitude of submission to the junta. For example, many lawyers associations, opposition parties, refugees and political prisoners have alerted us to the terrible consequences that would befall the Burmese people if the international community and, in particular, the European Union were to support and endorse the sham elections that have been called by the SPDC for 2010. They warn us that this would give carte blanche to the junta to continue committing a wide range of crimes with impunity.
Burma, a country known for its wonderful Buddhist temples which abound in gold, is also a prison for thousands of Burmese. They live in one of the biggest political regimes in the world, from which they try to escape - to the USA, Australia, Canada and to European countries and their neighbours. After adopting resolutions calling for the release of thousands of political prisoners, including many opposition leaders and with a Nobel Prize laureate foremost among them, and after protests from international organisations against the conscription of children in Burma, who are then forced to work and are denied proper care, today we are discussing the problem of human rights violations.
The Muslim ethnic minority is also being persecuted by the ruling military regime in Burma. This includes incidents of denial of citizens' rights, imprisonment, limited access to education, barriers to marriage, restrictions on free movement, and the destruction of mosques, churches and other places of worship. Although we should appreciate the permission granted by the Thai authorities for the temporary stay of refugees there, and also the declaration of the Prime Minister of Thailand in which he has announced an investigation, recent events are nevertheless an obvious example of the violation of human rights by the Thais.
The problem of Burmese refugees has a regional dimension, and neighbouring countries, such as India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, must work more closely together to resolve the problem and to provide the refugees with suitable care and shelter. International agencies are reporting cases of the inhumane treatment of Burmese refugees and of their brutal deportation, which is synonymous with sentencing them to certain death. When the Thai Coastguard pushed out to open sea a boat with a thousand refugees but no food supplies on board, it was an inhumane act and led to the deaths of many of the refugees.
(LT) There are two sides to these tragic events on the Burma-Thailand border. It is regrettable that the Thai authorities have resorted to indefensible measures, all the more so because Thailand is known as a state which respects human rights and which takes in many refugees. The Prime Minister has stated that these events will be investigated and that those who behaved improperly towards the Burmese boat refugees will be punished. Let us hope that these pledges will be fulfilled. On the other hand, it is not the first time we have discussed the brazen and inadmissible conduct of the Burmese regime. I think that the European Union should take stricter measures and, certainly, we expect not just words but actions on the part of the larger states. China, in particular, must put pressure on Burma to respect the rights of the opposition and minorities there.
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Antonio Santoro, prison officer, Lino Sabadin, butcher, Perluigi Torregiani, jeweller, and Andrea Campagna, state police officer: these are the names of four citizens who, together with many others, lost their lives between 6 June 1978 and 19 April 1979, killed by the insane homicide of terrorist organisations that attempted to overthrow the democratic order in Italy. And the name of one of the murderers is Cesare Battisti.
Let me remind you that Battisti was found guilty not only by the Italian judiciary, but also by the French judiciary and by the European Court of Human Rights. This is an inexplicable and extremely serious act, which cannot and must not go unnoticed by the European institutions. We have a duty to the relatives of Battisti's victims, but most importantly, we are also bound because the European Union has, for many years, determined an anti-terrorism strategy to guarantee citizens' safety and to safeguard democratic institutions. To stand by and watch would thus be to thwart the efforts made over the years to fight side by side against an ever-present threat.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also hopes that Brazil will reconsider and think hard about what is a very delicate, but utterly rightful and legitimate request. Brazil is a great democratic country and has always enjoyed an excellent relationship with Europe and with Italy, which is precisely why we have been taken by surprise by this door slammed in our face. Indeed, for the sake of the friendship and respect that joins our countries, for the sake of the friendship and cooperation and partnership agreements linking Brazil and the European Union, whether politically or economically, the response of all parties must be decisive and effective.
author. - (SV) I wish that we had discussed the Philippines instead, where the EU could have made a real contribution to saving the lives of many people. We are now discussing an individual legal case that is currently being tried in court, in connection with which we have the gall to say that we will stand up for the principle of the rule of law. Where I come from, one of the most fundamental principles of the rule of law is that a parliament does not interfere in individual court cases.
My group and I think that it is quite wrong to discuss an ongoing individual court case in a parliament. Unfortunately, this is not even the first or the last time, because we will soon be voting on the Medina report, which does the exact same thing. In an ongoing copyright case against Pirate Bay in a Swedish court, Parliament commented on the question of guilt while the case was still in progress. I really hope that this does not become a habit because, if it does, it would be us here in Europe who would be opposing and resisting our own principles of the rule of law and that would be extremely unfortunate. Thank you.
Allow me to examine our problem. The ravings of a terrorist and multiple murderer, condemned many times, cannot be defended by the government of a friendly country with whom we collaborate. We want to highlight the need, already expressed in a letter to the President-in-Office of the Union, for a debate in the Council that, starting with this incredible situation and taking account of new, internationalised terrorism, will tackle and decide on a shared rule on extradition, whether within the 27 countries of the Union or between the Union and third countries.
Cesare Battisti is a convicted murderer in Italy, and the stance taken by the Brazilian authorities to protect him from the reach of EU justice is not only unacceptable but also condemnable and deplorable in the strongest possible terms and we, and any other authority and any other body in the EU, have every right to say so. I hope that the Brazilian Government will come to its senses and, in re-examining this case, will do what is expected of it and extradite Mr Battisti to Italy as soon as possible and before this affair begins to have serious consequences for the otherwise good EU-Brazil relations. Brazil must not become a safe haven for convicted criminals and the EU must never allow murderers to escape punishment.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this joint motion for a resolution, this Parliament will make its authoritative voice heard, at international level, for reconsideration of the extradition of Cesare Battisti and, above all, it will pay tribute to the memory of the victims and show its solidarity with their families who, for more than 20 years, have been waiting for their fundamental right to justice, denied for so long, to at last be fulfilled. There is no need to say more, and so, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate the few remaining seconds of my speaking time to observe a moment's silence in remembrance.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Mrs Angelilli, for that important gesture, which illustrates how different the attitude of this House is to that of the European Union, which, like Pontius Pilate, is hypocritically washing its hands of the affair, while in fact there are two countries involved in this case: Italy, which has paid an extraordinarily high price for terrorism with its victims and very difficult years, and France, which is involved up to its neck thanks to the woeful interest of the infamous left-wing 'caviar' lobby, which already distinguished itself in the Petrella case and probably also in the role of the secret services.
In this way, Europe is undermining its anti-terrorism directives and losing all authority in the global strategy for combating terrorism. I wonder whether the same thing would have happened if it had been perhaps a German terrorist from the Red Army Faction? Europe is, however, saying to Brazil that to fail to extradite a common criminal and communist like Battisti, who today even in prison dares to mock his victims, would be to downgrade itself to a country of refuge for the worst criminals and terrorists.
As was also explained to the Italian Government, there is no scope for an involvement of the Commission in this case. The EU Treaty is very clear on this matter: the European Union's and Commission's legal powers in the field of cooperation in criminal matters are restricted to the legal space of the EU-27. The European Union can facilitate extradition between Member States, but has no competences regarding Member States' relations with third countries on criminal cooperation matters. Italy's bilateral relations with Brazil on this matter are governed by a bilateral agreement signed in 1989.
The wording originally said 'non-fire period', and that did not make any sense to us, so we changed it to 'cease-fire'. It now transpires that the official text from the Declaration of the Co-Chairs, which includes the European Union, uses the wording - which is strange, but nevertheless they use it in writing - 'no-fire' period. So, could we change the 'non-fire' to 'no-fire' rather than the word 'cease-fire', as this would reflect the official text of the Co-Chairs?
author. - Madam President, I have just realised that, owing to the order in which the amendments have been printed on the voting list, I was actually reading out the oral amendment to recital K. I apologise for the confusion, but in fact we are now amending paragraph 2. That may explain why there was some confusion. Could we switch the voting list around? I do apologise, but I have things down in the wrong order on my list. I was actually reading out the change I wanted to make to recital K, rather than to paragraph 2, so that is the one we will be voting on next. I do apologise for the confusion.
Ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, a Polish engineer, Piotr Stańczak, who has been held as a hostage by terrorists in Pakistan since last September, was murdered by his captors. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my outrage at this abhorrent murder of an innocent man who was a Polish citizen and a citizen of the European Union. The European Parliament denounces this criminal act in the strongest possible terms. We would like to offer the family of the deceased and all his relatives our heartfelt sympathy and condolences.
Ladies and gentlemen, the forest fires in Australia have led to a tragic loss of life over recent days. These, the worst bushfires in Australia's history, have claimed many lives in horrible circumstances. We were all horrified by the violent power of this natural disaster and its horrendous consequences. I have written to the Australian Prime Minister to convey the sincere sympathy of the European Parliament. On behalf of the European Parliament at today's plenary session, I would like, once again, to express our solidarity with Australia, its people and its authorities in these sad times.
Ladies and gentlemen, worrying news is again emerging from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Seven leading figures in the Bahá'í religious community were taken into custody in May 2008. For eight months, they were denied the opportunity of legal counsel. Now, these seven dignitaries of the Bahá'í religious community are to be subjected to a trial this week that meets not even the most basic requirements of the rule of law. The Nobel prize-winner and Iranian lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who was prepared to handle the defence of the imprisoned leaders, has herself been on the receiving end of death threats.
The European Parliament calls on the Iranian authorities once again, and in the most urgent terms, to respect human rights and the rights of religious minorities and to reconsider its indictment against the seven leaders of the Bahá'í - Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Saeid Rasaie, Mahvash Sabet, Behrouz Tavakkoli and Vahid Tizfahm. These people were incarcerated solely as a result of their beliefs and should be released immediately.
Ladies and gentlemen, last Friday, 13 February 2009, the Spanish Member of this House, Mr Herrero, was arrested by the Venezuelan Government in the capital, Caracas, and subsequently expelled from the country, as a result of comments he had made to the media about the Venezuelan Government. Mr Herrero was in the country as part of the official delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who had been invited by an opposition party in the context of the constitutional referendum. To arrest him, the police forced their way into his hotel room and they then put him on a scheduled flight to Brazil, without an official explanation or any opportunity to collect his personal belongings. We find this unacceptable!
This House - Parliament - knows just how difficult and how intractable the situation may seem. Too often, the region has been plagued by cycles of violence, rising extremism and economic hardship. At the same time, the conditions for Europeans and Americans to work together in the search for peace in the Middle East are probably better than ever. I have just returned from Washington where I had good discussions with everybody there in the Obama administration. I think I have the assurance from them that the strong commitment that has been expressed is a reality. We are willing and ready to work with them towards achieving success in this conflict.
We are looking forward to welcoming positive announcements on the ceasefire. The day before yesterday, there were good meetings, and let us hope that they will continue today and in the future so that a ceasefire may be called, without delay. As you know, Egypt will also host an important conference on reconstruction on 2 March and we expect all the international community to make a commitment there. The European Union, too, played its role. We immediately expressed our willingness to contribute in concrete ways to a durable ceasefire. We also stated our readiness to re-dispatch our monitors to the Rafah crossing point, in accordance with the agreement that we signed in 2005. We are ready to operate at Rafah, or at any other crossing points where help is needed or requested.
Thank you very much, High Representative. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that, this coming Sunday, I will be leading a delegation, in my capacity as President of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, to Gaza, Ramallah, Sderot und Jerusalem for two and a half days. Amongst other things, talks are to be held with President Peres and Prime Minister Olmert in Jerusalem and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and Prime Minister Fayyad in Ramallah. In Gaza, preparations will be made for the United Nations visit, which will then be carried out.
This is clearly not where we wanted to be at the beginning of 2009. But if there is, some day, to be peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the only way forward is to do all we can to get the talks back on track. This human tragedy in Gaza has had a huge impact on the region. I returned only last night from a trip to Syria and Lebanon, and I will certainly also say something about that but, in particular, let me say that what we need to do is to make clear to all Israeli leaders that the EU expects sustained commitment to the peace process and to the two-state solution.
To that end, as I just said, I have just returned from Syria and Lebanon, where I met President Assad in Syria, President Sleiman in Lebanon, and other key partners. The recent conflict has badly damaged negotiations not only on the Palestinian, but also on the Syrian, track. We therefore exchanged views on the peace process at length. I reiterated the very strong support of the European Union for the Arab peace initiative, and I urged partners to maintain their commitment to it, because it offers a serious framework for regional peace talks.
Much very delicate work is going on. To give but a flavour of the pace of activity we have all been involved in: for instance, I was at a working dinner of the Paris Co-Chairs on 15 January, the Summit meetings in Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem on 18 January, and EU ministerial meetings with Israel on 21 January and with a group composed of Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Turkey on 25 January. In addition, Commissioner Louis Michel, who is responsible for humanitarian aid, visited Gaza on 24 and 25 January.
In early March, the Egyptian Government is organising an international conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in support of the Palestinian economy for the reconstruction of Gaza. We, as the Commission, will be a co-sponsor of this event. I am delighted that I had the opportunity to discuss the pledge that the Commission intends to make with the Chairs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets at an early stage here in Parliament on 2 February. Thank you again for your support.
The European Union is already playing a major role in the region. The financial support it has given and continues to give to the Palestinians is considerable. It has done a lot upstream to prevent the humanitarian disaster we are witnessing today. Despite the obstacles, it continues to give humanitarian aid and assistance to the population of the Gaza Strip. Just today, the European Union has granted EUR 41 million in aid to the United Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees. This, then, is not the moment for us to start to keep our mouths shut.
Moreover, we issue a warning to Hamas. Last month's incidents, when Hamas confiscated, and failed to return, the humanitarian aid distributed by the United Nations Agency in the region are scandalous, intolerable and must not be repeated. All the players involved must anticipate the reconstruction phase and actively prepare it by assessing the damage on the ground and by preparing a plan for the financial, economic and social rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip. This rehabilitation is essential for the region's stability. That is the objective of the donor conference that meets in Sharm el-Sheikh on 2 March.
Yet there is also hope emanating from the United States. President Obama, Hillary Clinton and their team offer a consensus and dialogue-oriented model, something completely different from the previous administration which has now, thankfully, left office. So there is hope in Washington. What about Jerusalem, though? What Benjamin Netanyahu had to say during the election campaign certainly did pose a threat to the peace process, while Avigor Liebermann is also certainly a threat to the peace process in the Middle East. This asynchronicity poses a risk.
What is going on in Lebanon? What influence will Hezbollah have in future? To what extent is it prepared to engage in constructive dialogue, before and after the election in Lebanon? What about the Western-oriented majority? Would that majority be able to react to an election victory by integrating Hezbollah? Is Hezbollah prepared to allow itself to be integrated? This depends, to a crucial degree, on who governs in Tehran. The issue of the election outcome in Iran is of central importance. This is also true for the attitude of Hamas.
The question of whether we have a radical president who denies Israel's right to exist - as the current incumbent does - or whether there is to be a government that is prepared to talk and this readiness to talk stretches from Tehran to Beirut and on to Rafah is a crucial issue for the stabilisation of the whole region. We are in favour of a unity government for the Palestinians. Without a unity government for the Palestinians, the peace process is unmanageable. It is therefore now up to Hamas to show that it is willing and able to join such a government.
The basic precondition for this, however, is to be talking with Hamas, that those amongst the Palestinian people who want to talk with Hamas be supported and that they not be forced onto the defensive by a government in Jerusalem that knows only the politics of continuing the settlements. As a side point, if it is true that 163 hectares have now been re-released for settlement, this is a destabilising element and this is something that we need to be absolutely forthright in making clear to our friends in Israel.
In the Middle East, everything is interconnected. It is not possible to simply pick out individual elements and believe it possible to solve an individual problem by military means. That is why the basis for everything is the readiness to talk. The Arab League's plan, Saudi Arabia's peace plan, envisages an end to violence with simultaneous recognition of Israel's right to exist. This is a bold and ambitious plan, and it is one that needs to be discussed. It is progress in itself that there are people in the Arab League, in the Arab camp, who are prepared to have that debate. That is something that must be supported. Bombers are not the way to support this, and I might add that the way to support the work of the European Union is likewise not for what we build to be destroyed again for whatever military reasons. For this reason, our message can only be that dialogue is the precondition.
High Representative Solana, you said that this is your first time before us this year. This is perhaps also your last visit before our elections in June. As dialogue is very much a sine qua non for success, I would like to say to you, on behalf of my group, that you represent the personification of dialogue. Your work deserves more than respect. It deserves a great degree of admiration, above all, for your continuous advocacy of dialogue. For that, you have our sincere appreciation.
Looking at the recent conflict in Gaza, all the old familiar phrases apply: blame on both sides; provocation by Hamas; disproportionate response by Israel. But in the face of the recurring violence, we have recycled those tired phrases so often that they have lost whatever impact they once had. We cannot go on like this. Of course, it is our moral duty to assist in the reconstruction of Gaza. Of course, it makes sense to seek safeguards from Israel. It is bad enough to see the airport, schools and sewerage systems blown up; it is worse to rebuild them with European money knowing that they will likely be destroyed once again.
The time has come for diplomacy, delicate but determined. In which forum? In the Quartet, Mr Solana? Well, perhaps, but let us first acknowledge that the policy failures, the dashed hopes and the creeping extremism of the past seven years have taken place under the Quartet's watch. Its envoy, Tony Blair, has never even been to Gaza. If he went there, he could visit the site of the industrial area, which is one of his pet projects, designed to generate jobs, but levelled last month.
Lastly, we can only prepare for the future if we acknowledge honestly what has happened in the past. There should be a free and fair international investigation into alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict. The UNRWA and our own parliamentary committee have both reported alarming evidence of war crimes, and the allegations are serious indeed. If Israel is wrongly accused, its name should be cleared, but if it has committed those crimes, it must face up to its responsibilities. Our aim must be to forge an agreement for a peaceful and prosperous future on both sides of the divide, where enemies can once again become partners. However, the failure of our approach to date is written in spilled blood on the ground. Mr Solana, we must pioneer a new path to peace, and the European Union, if necessary, must take the lead.
Thirdly, and most importantly of all, despite all the political disagreements, geographical disagreements and historical disputes, it is the same people who continue to suffer day after day after day: women, children, innocent civilians, people who have no truck with political groups, political organisations or with paramilitary groups or terrorist organisations. These are the poor innocents caught in the middle of the rocket fire, of the bombing and the so-called - and I laugh when I hear these words being used - 'targeted intelligent bombing'. There is no such thing as an 'intelligent' or 'safe' bomb. When it lands, it blows up - it kills people.
We have ample evidence to show that not only the Hamas rockets going into Israel killed innocent people but that, a hundred times more, the bombs and the bullets from the Israeli forces have killed thousands and injured thousands of people within Gaza and within the Occupied Territories. Indeed, we have evidence from an Irishman, John King, who works for UNRWA in Gaza, to show that, when they informed the Israeli authorities that their bombs were landing close to a UN compound in Gaza that was storing fuel and food and was also acting as a refuge to children whose school had been bombed earlier in the day, the bombs came closer; and when they had to phone them a second time, the bombs landed on the fuel dump within the UN compound.
Of course, we must get aid and assistance to the Palestinian people for the rebuilding of their areas. Of course we must ensure and insist that talks take place and that peace can be allowed to flourish, but that requires us to take brave moves within Europe as well. Like Martin Schulz, I congratulate Javier Solana on walking that long lonely path of speaking to people that nobody else would speak to, of opening the doors of dialogue, because ultimately only through dialogue between enemies can you make peace, and only through peace can you build the foundations of a solid two-state solution that will guarantee peace, equity, security and justice within the Middle East.
This is a real humanitarian crisis, and how are we going to address that urgently? Ninety per cent of people in Gaza are dependent on UN aid. This is not linked to any negotiations. We have to ensure that that aid gets through, and the key to that is the lifting of the siege and the opening of the crossing points. How can a densely populated area of 1.5 million people that has been bombed for 22 days and in which over 1 000 people were killed even begin to recover when only 15 categories of humanitarian items are being allowed in: food, some medicines and mattresses? You cannot rebuild homes and offices without cement and glass, which are banned. You cannot teach children in schools that have no paper because it is banned. You cannot feed people when there is not enough food being allowed in. It is not that the aid is not there, but it is not being allowed through. We have to put pressure on the Israeli Government to end the blockade and open the crossings.
Those who call themselves friends of Israel to justify the impunity and unlimited accommodation shown towards its current ruling class should reflect on these words from the great Israeli writer David Grossman, whom I wish to quote: 'Amidst the wave of nationalist hyperbole now sweeping the nation, it would not hurt to recall that in the final analysis, this last operation in Gaza is just another stop along a trail blazing with fire, violence and hatred. A trail marked at times by victory, at other times by defeat, but which is leading us inevitably to ruin'.
This leads to a question, Mr Solano, as you said nothing on the subject of international law. What pressure is the Union prepared to exert on Israel over Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem, to remind its current and future leaders that membership of the international community in general, and the privileged partnership with the European Union in particular, come at a price, that they have no place for military occupation, nor war crimes, nor a policy which pushes each day towards a divorce between Europe and the Arab-Muslim world?
The vast majority of the people of Gaza must rely on humanitarian aid for their very survival - food, water, shelter, clothes and, especially, medicine. This is a population that has been under siege for a very long time. All crossing points have been closed for 18 months and now, with the terrible recent aggression visited on the people of Gaza, they are even more desperate. Because the siege has still not been lifted and crossings are still closed, it is very difficult to get essentials to the people.
I note in recital E of this resolution that we Europeans give ourselves a nice pat on the back for our humanitarian aid efforts. You, Commissioner, talked of the political efforts that you are making, but do we deserve this praise? Israel-EU trade is worth EUR 27 billion annually. If we really wanted action on Gaza, we would use the power that this trade gives us by imposing economic sanctions. Our refusal to do this, even at the height of the bombing in January, indicated that we prefer the status quo of business as usual, with our contribution of humanitarian aid possibly being a salve to our conscience. Not only are we unwilling to risk upsetting a good business market for the sake of bringing injustice in Gaza to an end, but we are also unwilling so far to dissolve or even just suspend the EU-Israel agreement.
To return to the urgency of the humanitarian aid: rebuilding physical infrastructure is important, but it is understandable that agencies may be hesitant to rebuild when it looks as though an even more threatening regime is taking over in Israel. Rebuilding human infrastructure, however, cannot wait. We must get supplies in. I would especially point out that the particularly vicious weaponry used in January has left many people with missing limbs and terrible burns. I myself know what it is like to have a healthy child become disabled.
The US and Israel do the bombing while Europe finances reconstruction. That is how tasks are allocated amongst the allies. It should, however, be up to those who do the damage to pay. Egypt is at the centre of the peace talks that are discussing an extended ceasefire with Hamas. However, the challenge is formidable as the new Israeli Government, under pressure from the third man, Mr Liebermann, the far-right leader who is democratically accepted over there, risks seeing its task singularly complicated in this negotiation. In fact, Mr Netanyahu, who is presented as the future prime minister, has always been opposed to a truce with Hamas.
Allow me to add a thought on France's return to NATO's integrated military structure, which will be debated within the framework of the Vatanen report. This return will result in France taking on heavy obligations. In fact, we are rejoining NATO even though the Cold War has been over since 1990. Mr Sarkozy seems to have forgotten the fall of the Berlin Wall and Russia's return to the ranks of free nations. Is there a need to reinforce the bloc line of thinking at a time when we see multipolarity and the rising power of emerging countries, including on the military level?
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - (ES) Mr President, I will not be able to answer all those who have spoken during this debate in the little time available to me. Allow me to express my most heartfelt thanks for what you said about me personally and what I do. I would just like to tell you that you can be sure that I will continue to work just as determinedly - even more so if possible - because the situation is becoming more difficult every day.
First, humanitarian issues: there can be no doubt that the most pressing and important question is the humanitarian one. The violence of recent days and weeks has thrown into sharp relief some enormous gaps in what is needed to alleviate the population's suffering, in particular, amongst the people of Gaza. Therefore, we will do everything in our power to alleviate the great hardships of daily life in Gaza. The Commission will do so - without the slightest hesitation - as will the Member States of the Council; the entire international community will do so.
Second, the opening of the border crossings between Gaza and Israel and between Gaza and Egypt is absolutely essential to this. Moreover, these must be opened quickly, without delay. From our point of view, all aid will be supplied wherever it is needed and, as far as Rafah is concerned in particular, we will be ready for deployment as soon as possible. There are already European Union observers there, available, so that as soon as the frontier is opened at Rafah, we will be ready to deploy.
Many speakers have mentioned the obligations that we may assume, depending on whether there is a new Palestinian consensus government. It seems to me, honourable Members - and this is my personal opinion - that if there is a Palestinian consensus government, a government whose goal is the Two States, a government whose goal is to build these Two States through peaceful means, a government that has a programme of reconstruction in Gaza, and a government that attempts to build an electoral process in 2009, I believe that such a government is one that the European Union should support.
Fourth, on the question of Israel: there are two important issues following the elections. Firstly, that the government that has emerged from the elections, or that will emerge from the majority produced by the elections, is obliged, as far as we can see, to carry on with a peace process. For this reason, whatever government does emerge from the elections, we will continue working and doing everything we can to ensure that it becomes established, and that it works and contributes towards carrying on a peace process, doing everything in its power to conclude that process as far as possible during 2009.
I would like to tell you that in 2001, I worked with the then Senator Mitchell on the famous report that bears his name. I was one of the four people who worked on that programme. I would like you, honourable Members, to be so good as to re-read that report, published in 2001, in which things were said that, unfortunately, still have to be said today; for example, on the subject of the settlements. If we in the European Union are incapable of trying to change the way in which the settlements are being established, there is little chance of any peace initiative having credibility. Therefore, this issue must be taken seriously. We must talk seriously with our friends in Israel to ensure that the issue of the settlements is dealt with in a radically different way.
Mr President, honourable Members, as I have said, 2009 will be an enormously important year. We will have to continue to manage the crisis, bring humanitarian aid, do everything in our power to ensure that there is a ceasefire, and do everything in our power to ensure that negotiation takes place between Israel and Gaza and between Egypt and Gaza. However, honourable Members, if we do not change our mentality from a position of crisis-management to one deeply rooted in conflict-resolution, we will be in the same situation to which we have unfortunately returned at the start of 2009.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I just wanted to say again that last year we clearly said that failure is not an option. We were all hopeful for the Annapolis process and we were hopeful for a peace process. Unfortunately, the military incursion into Gaza after the rockets launched from Gaza into Israel have changed the equation. Now we all know that there is a series of elements that is absolutely necessary so that we can come back to peace agreements. In any case, however, one thing is sure: a military solution is no solution. On this I agree with all of you. Therefore, whatever the cost, we will all have to work in order to bring about peace.
The recent elections in Israel and the new US administration offer the opportunity for a new beginning in the Middle East peace process. I believe that the EU must convey a clear message of support to the new cabinet in Tel Aviv while, at the same time, clearly expressing what is expected of its Israeli partners in terms of pursuing measures which will facilitate a lasting peace, which includes shutting down the settlements on the West Bank and offering strong support for a dual-state solution, and help avoid military excesses and the serious humanitarian repercussions they entail.
The European Union should also do everything in its power to bring about an end to the dispute in which innocent citizens are losing their lives. Furthermore, efforts should concentrate on bringing assistance to people, on ensuring that they have the basic means to live. The population of the Gaza Strip have only 60% of their daily food needs available, which means that they are even more at risk of disease and exposed to difficult conditions. The lack of drinking water constitutes no less a threat than the lack of food. I do not, I think, need to mention the lack of medical care or the destruction of schools and public institutions, which is significantly hindering the establishment of order and a return to normality.
With the European Parliament resolution on humanitarian aid to Gaza, the EU is endeavouring, driven by the principle of treating the slaughtering Israelis on equal terms with the resisting Palestinians, to conceal its huge responsibility for the slaughter of the Palestinian people during the murderous Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip which resulted in over 1 300 dead, the majority of whom were children, women and the elderly, and over 5 000 injured. The complete destruction of thousands of homes and every social infrastructure, in conjunction with the complete economic isolation imposed by Israel, has resulted in the Palestinian population living under tragic and inhumane conditions.
There is no doubt that the Palestinian population urgently needs aid. There is no doubt that we must recognise the suffering of the Palestinian population. However, it is also essential to denounce the aggressors and hold them responsible. Instead, the resolution insists on whitewashing the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip, hiding it behind the term 'conflict'. This aggression is part of the strategy to overcome the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people to the occupation and to undermine the conditions required for building a Palestinian state.
The proposals resulting from the Paris summit on 14 July last year put forward two objectives that are worthy of our support. The first of these is to give practical shape to economic, regional and environmental integration projects and to make them more effective, by creating a secretariat entrusted with this task, receiving public and private funding; the second is to strengthen political dialogue within the whole process, through new institutions such as the co-presidency, the summit of Heads of State or Government and the regular Foreign Ministers meetings. In this context, I would like to emphasise the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which was recognised in the Paris text and then in the Marseille document.
We wish to highlight the value of institutions that involve both the European Union and the countries in the south and east of the Mediterranean while, at the same time, signalling that it is essential not to reduce the entire process to a solely intergovernmental approach. We hope for widespread involvement of civil society and social partners, not least because the economic crisis can worsen the already endemic and terrible problems such as unemployment and increasing migratory pressure, making this phenomenon even more difficult to manage. We are calling for greater attention to be paid to the issues of human rights that affect the behaviour of all the partner countries to a greater or lesser degree.
As regards the institutions, let us remember that with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union may be assured of coherent and structured representation through the new figures of the President of the Council and the European Foreign Minister. In the meantime, it would be beneficial to ensure continuity in the European presence, at least in the co-presidency. We know that the Czech Presidency has been sensitive to this, and hope that the Swedish Presidency, too, will be willing to accept this message.
The Paris Summit last July created the Union for the Mediterranean and established a partnership built on the existing Barcelona Process. The current rotating presidency gives priority to strengthening this partnership. Even though the Lisbon Treaty has not yet come into force, I can assure you that, in the spirit of co-ownership, we are placing a particular focus on the development of this initiative and, in particular, the regional projects. These are important. They offer concrete signs to the citizens of the region that the partnership works in their interest.
There are two particular areas of cooperation which I know are important to this Parliament and which we also fully support. The first is interparliamentary cooperation through the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and its committees. This initiative is key to developing a strong parliamentary dimension to the Union for the Mediterranean. It will, as is pointed out in your resolution, serve to reinforce its democratic legitimacy. It will also help promote the basic values which lie at the heart of the European Union. We very much welcome the way in which you and your President have embraced this particular initiative, and offer you our full support.
The Union for the Mediterranean offers us the potential for developing better relations among its members. Recent events have shown that this is not an easy enterprise, but they have also underlined the importance of our continuing to work to this end. We are only too aware of the difficulties faced by the populations in the region as a result of the crisis in Gaza. As you know, this has led to the postponement of meetings of the Union for the Mediterranean, but the Presidency believes that regional cooperation and dialogue is the way to achieve peace, build confidence and create prosperity and we certainly expect to resume work within the Union for the Mediterranean as soon as possible.
Therefore, a démarche of the Czech EU Presidency and the French Union for the Mediterranean Co-Presidency, on behalf of the EU members of the Union for the Mediterranean, possibly together with the Egyptian Co-Presidency, addressed to our Arab partners, is just being prepared. Its purpose is to appeal for a resumption of all Union for the Mediterranean activities automatically and without any conditionality immediately after the League of Arab States Doha Summit at the end of March. We intend to use the opportunity of the Donor Conference on Gaza, which will be held on 2 March in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, for further consideration by the three Ministers of Foreign Affairs: Karel Schwarzenberg, the Czech Foreign Minister; Bernard Kouchner, the French Foreign Minister; and the Foreign Minister of Egypt.
Indeed, we must reduce these discrepancies via social economic development, more trade and increased investments. We must counter ideological radicalism, for which the lack of development and a sense of injustice provide fertile ground, with dialogue and political solutions to conflicts. We must pursue responsible and concerted migration policies, as you said, to benefit from demographic stabilisation in Europe and the demographic growth of the Mediterranean countries. There you have several examples of the challenges we must face together with our partners in the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean.
This has given rise to the current suspension of the work that, personally, I regret greatly, but, of course, we hope to get to work again at some stage. The meeting to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, where the Commission will, of course, have an important role to play as cosponsor, will be very important. I hope that various other meetings will be held afterwards. A lot of work has been done already, in fact, and when the Commission is working, it takes it very seriously.
How can we ensure the continuation of the projects? In the history of European integration, we have been very successful in the economic and commercial fields. It is for this very reason that we in the Committee on International Trade have considered how our successful mechanisms could be applied to our neighbours in southern Europe. One objective is the creation of a free trade area by 2010, but this, too, has ground to a halt. It is precisely because political conflicts are blocking this process that we should strengthen the economic field.
We also tried to help the Council with the important decisions that it had to make. Mr Vondra, this House wishes to cooperate with the Council and we laid down the criteria that the headquarters of this new Union for the Mediterranean needed to meet. Coincidentally, these criteria coincided with a city in a country that I know very well; in fact, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs decided that Barcelona could be a good headquarters. Moreover, the ministers recognised it shortly afterwards, which, Mr President, reflects once again this desire to cooperate with the Council.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has gone to great lengths, over the years, to build an ever-stronger, ever-more active role for Europe. Funding is not enough; funding alone is no longer sufficient; what is required is substantial renewed political action. One of the many shared challenges is that of tackling immigration into Europe. This problem cannot be addressed through cooperation with political opponents, nor can it be addressed through populism; rather it requires rigorous controls to ensure compliance with the law and the Convention on Human Rights.
For this reason, my political group will vote against the amendments tabled by the far left; we believe that they are excessively controversial and not very constructive. My political wing seeks to give renewed impetus to this valuable activity, which will become essential in the near future, and therefore we support the re-launch of the EMPA, no longer as a mere discussion forum, but as a place where important joint decisions can be made for our future and the future of all those living on the shores of the Mediterranean.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Napoletano on the excellent report that she is presenting to us this afternoon, but above all, and most importantly, because she has been a Euro-Mediterranean da prima ora. Without her work and her impetus, we would not have been able to imagine firstly a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum, or subsequently a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and we would not now be in a position to demand the role that the representatives of citizens should have in what we are trying to set up.
I would like to follow on from my colleague Mr Méndez de Vigo, who always quotes great literary figures, by recalling a phrase from Shakespeare's King Lear, in which it is said that 'The worst is not, so long as we can say, "This is the worst”'. We have strived to do the opposite, because at a time when the situation in the Middle East is worse than ever, we have established an instrument whose aim is for the region as a whole to contribute to political, economic and social development, as a basic framework for resolving conflicts. This is what the Union for the Mediterranean is, after all. This is a Union for the Mediterranean that is not ex novo, but has come from the deep roots of the Barcelona Process, creating new institutions such as the Permanent Secretariat, which will be in Barcelona. It is something that we welcome as Europeans, as Mediterraneans, as Spaniards and as the parliamentary representatives who asked for it at the time. It is also an acceptance of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly as what it should be: a way for parliamentarians and citizens to express themselves within this Union.
Thank you, Mrs Napoletano, for this excellent report. A couple of days before the war broke out in Gaza, I was representing Parliament and the EMPA in Jordan, at the last ministerial conference that took place before activities were once again suspended due to the violence in the Middle East. It was a conference on water. It was a ministerial conference on one of the key issues on which there needs to be cooperation across the Mediterranean, which is going to create conflicts, is a question of survival and is also the target of some possible large projects in the Mediterranean, involving solar energy, transferring water and many other things.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that I, on the other hand, will vote in favour of Mrs Napoletano's motion for a resolution, because in my opinion, it is undoubtedly strategic to identify major projects to be carried out and equally useful to highlight the need to adopt a 'programme agreements' approach in order to do so. These agreements should, however, be based - and I believe it is very important to emphasise this - on the principle of subsidiarity.
Let me give you an example. When I was asked to prepare a report on de-pollution of the Mediterranean, the programmes involved are the following: the Mediterranean Hotspot Investment Programme, the Strategy for Water in the Mediterranean, the EU Marine Strategy, the UNEP/MAP, the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development, the Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Programme, the Mediterranean EU water initiative and the MYIS, which have been running under the umbrella of the Horizon 2020 programme. This fragmentation makes visibility suffer.
The other impediment is the Middle East problem. I salute the position of Mr Solana that the Quartet will this time operate in a different way to the past. This is not due to the lack of will on the part of the European Union, but due to the previous policy of the American Administration. I hope that, this time, with the dispatch of Mr Mitchell to the area, political progress will be made. We have done a lot on this issue. I visited Lebanon very recently, and I saw there that UNIFIL, with the presence of the European contingents, makes a repeat of hostilities in southern Lebanon and Israel impossible.
(PT) My thanks go to my colleague, Pasqualina Napoletano, for her excellent report. Fourteen years after Barcelona and five years after the first Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, we have the Union for the Mediterranean with economic and parliamentary power, with civil society, and with the heads of government deciding together. Everyone wants to do more and better in this territory where 720 million citizens represent real potential for development and peace in the world. Restricting ourselves solely to the economic and business dimensions is clearly a mistake. Responding to the growth crises naturally requires a political response, but responding to the humanitarian crises, to emergency situations and to military crises, such as the one witnessed at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009, is crucial.
(PT) In her speech, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner summarised the objectives of the new Union. In truth, this Union was born during the French Presidency under the star sign of mistakes. The first mistake was to remove from its agenda the conflicts in the region, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Western Sahara conflict. The second mistake is for the Union to try and assert itself by sharing economic and environmental projects, without questioning the free trade context in which it sits. The third mistake is to insinuate that there is a possibility of transferring to this Union Turkey's application for accession to the European Union.
Mrs Napoletano's report goes against this perception. However, we do not want the Union to suffer the same problem as the Barcelona Process. It apparently encompasses many projects and many areas of action, but the priorities are not correctly ranked. Relegating intercultural and inter-societal understanding among the peoples on both shores to paragraph 26 and leaving the issue of democratising and promoting human rights to paragraph 27 and migratory flows to paragraph 28, after having talked so much about other sectors and other issues, leaves a mistaken impression of what the priorities of this partnership are, or must be.
There must be a clear strategy. In our opinion, this strategy must involve offering more benefits and more cooperation to our neighbours, but also asking them for more results at the economic, social and democratic levels, and concentrating on well-defined and perhaps a smaller number of sectors to prevent all areas having equal priority, which runs the risk of nothing ultimately being a priority. Clearly, this can only be achieved with appropriate support and funding. Recognising the need for an investment bank for the Mediterranean must ultimately be favourably received. It is essential to be ambitious, which means properly doing everything within our power.
However, if you would allow me, Commissioner, I would like to mention a particular country that is not a Mediterranean coastal state but has been included; it is an ACP country and also a member of the Union for the Mediterranean. This country, Mauritania, is today going through a very serious political crisis. I think that, as a partner in the Union for the Mediterranean, as an ACP country and in the name of the neighbourhood policy, this country deserves our support to help it get out of this crisis.
It is of critical importance to mainstream the use of renewable energy including wind, hydro, various solar technologies and others. Being able to rely on it at peak demand depends entirely on spreading the input into our grids from as many sources as possible so that the output can always respond to demand. If the wind is not blowing off the north-west coast of Ireland - and Ireland has been described as the Saudi Arabia of Europe in terms of wind energy! - it will be off the north-west coast of Africa, or the solar thermal operations in the Mediterranean, especially Spain, will be feeding the grid, or the range of PV installations across the region will be inputting.
The opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality highlights the need for all Member States to pay closer attention to ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and all other United Nations and International Labour Organisation human rights instruments. It also draws attention to the situation of women, regretting that no special consideration has been given to this issue in the Commission communication, particularly in the 'projects' dimension, which should include the promotion of geographical, economic and social cohesion and which should always take into account the issue of equal opportunities for men and women and the gender perspective.
Secondly, the Union for the Mediterranean is part of the framework of the neighbourhood policy. The neighbourhood policy represents the bilateral policy and the Barcelona process, while the Union for the Mediterranean constitutes the multilateral part. Of course, I can also tell you that the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea are part of the same framework, although they are in the North. Do not worry then. Fortunately, everything is there. This, in fact, is what the French Presidency wanted, in other words, to share the copresidency with the Mediterranean countries - as I said before - and to work together.
That said, I might add that, despite this temporary suspension, we are working at the Commission in a constructive spirit, of course, to implement the four to six projects that have been put forward as priorities. These are civil protection, de-pollution of the Mediterranean sea, maritime highways and also a solar plan, within the framework of which we are doing a lot of work on renewable energy, particularly solar energy, as the latter, along with wind energy and other energy sources, is very important.
Similarly, I hope - I say so quite openly, I will no longer be rapporteur - but I hope that Europe's institutional framework can itself evolve. Why? Because once we have a European Foreign Minister who will, in part, represent the Commission and the Council, I hope that this minister will not be a 28th foreign minister to add to all the others but, at least on the European side, the Member States will feel that they are represented by this person. There will then perhaps be no need to add more states to the Union, but if we have a senior representative in the Foreign Minister, we may be able to consolidate the role of the European Union. This is something we have all worked towards, and so we give our wholehearted support not only to the fact that the regional programmes should continue but also, as the Commissioner knows, that Parliament attaches great importance to these programmes, which have arguably produced better results.
In the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, the incidence of poverty and social exclusion, which seriously affect women and children, is disturbing. It is essential that Member States and partners engaged in the Barcelona Process emphasise inclusion of the gender perspective in all policies and specific measures which promote equal opportunities for men and women. All States taking part in the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean should ratify both the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and all other United Nations and International Labour Organisation human rights instruments as soon as possible.
in writing. - I welcome the efforts made to further develop the EU's relations in the Euromed region, but I would like also to underline that the EU should not neglect its two other seas - the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. The Baltic Sea strategy will be one of the priorities under the Swedish Presidency. Also, the Black Sea Synergy carries strategic importance. The EU has to take care and find a common spirit in developing all these regions in a balanced manner. The EU is an integrated community and the long-term strategic development of all its regions has equal importance.
I will briefly point out some of the contributions that the report makes. Firstly, it clarifies the definition of 'European research infrastructure' in order to avoid confusions between the legal entity and the actual research infrastructure. It also clarifies and completes the requirements for a piece of research infrastructure to be considered European, adding important issues such as an impact assessment for the proposal at the European level, justifying its financing capacity and ensuring that there is a good policy of access to the whole European scientific community.
We therefore want to send a clear message to the Council to resolve its problems on this issue as soon as possible and to say once again that if we want to promote research in Europe, we must release it from tax burdens. This is something that we have recommended on several occasions in order to encourage SMEs to participate in R&D tasks, and which we now need to support in relation with the creation of large research infrastructures at European level, because they are essential for the progress of science.
Many times, for working purposes, it is addressed as a tax exemption issue, which creates some confusion. In reality, it concerns only the implementation of the existing VAT Directive, which has already been agreed and adopted by the Council. The real question is whether European research infrastructure should be given the status of international organisations, as defined in the VAT Directive and, as such, be exempt from the VAT payment. Therefore, we are not talking about fiscal harmonisation but about setting up the legal entities related to research infrastructures.
Last year, we introduced the Energy Club in this House - which Vice-President Onesta attended - where the scientific community and those responsible radiated enthusiasm for inventions with the potential to bring us all very great benefits. Creating such research instruments is the right answer, particularly in the present economic and energy crisis, so as to enable the development of new products and services that can then be marketed worldwide. The Commission's initiative on this is particularly to be welcomed, therefore, as the organisation of such initiatives of course reinforces the international possibilities. International cooperation, in particular, is increasingly important for us in Europe, as it is for our partners. After all, we in Europe have made ourselves the part of the world with the greatest purchasing power, and our 500 million citizens have the right to have the research results drawn up as quickly and efficiently as possible. Thank you.
Mr President, the aim of the European Research Infrastructure (ERI) is to create unique research centres managed by the most distinguished specialists working in specific fields. They should, in my opinion, possess a great deal of expensive, cutting-edge equipment, and be staffed by a team of scientists. The ERI will be used for the experimental study, mainly using inductive methods, of phenomena in the world around us, with the aim of producing practical solutions. The ERI should also serve to train young scientists.
I think that the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures is not intended to copy present centres of excellence but, by using structural and national funds, to create different research units which will complement the centres of excellence and create an infrastructure of specialist research units, a uniform network spanning the entire EU. Young, ambitious European researchers will not be forced to travel across the ocean to implement their ideas. Thus, I think that the preconditions for the effective functioning of the ERI include a high degree of specialisation and mobility in terms of the research environment. Research will become more effective if time constraints are introduced and if it is spread across several locations, i.e. if basic research tasks are carried out simultaneously in various international specialist ERI units which, as they are not economic entities, would be exempt from tax.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Do we need a European economic legal entity in the research sector or is this yet another example of the EU's persistent fight against European pluralism? The truth is, of course, that institutional competition is necessary for successful institutional reforms. Imagine if an international legal research framework had been established 50 years ago. Development in this area would have ceased. Changing international treaties is difficult and proceeds far too slowly. Progress is made if countries can easily reform their national institutions. Successful reforms then spread to other countries.
I feel that at this time, we need to promptly focus our attention on the existing differences in the area of developing an infrastructure for innovation and research between developed Member States and those with a developing economy so that we do not trigger a major migration of researchers from the economies of the states which have recently joined to the Member States whose economies are at the forefront of the global economy. Homogenous distribution of these infrastructures and of research opportunities within the European Union would be beneficial to the whole European Union and would help to combat the migration of scientists from East to West.
I have two quick points. I have in front of me - and I would like to compliment the Commissioner and his staff - a publication entitled 'A more research-intensive and integrated European Research Area: Science, Technology and Competitiveness key figures report 2008/2009'. I think the figures may be well out of date, given the collapse in GDP across the EU and elsewhere. I particularly pick up the point that public funding of R&D can be counter-cyclical, as happened in Japan and the US in the early 1990s and early noughties respectively. When there were collapses in their GDP, the public sector investment in R&D went up.
My second point concerns the frightening prospect as regards the EU's world share in patent applications, which has declined by an alarming figure. The high costs of patents in Europe, you say, might possibly explain this. In Europe, the costs and corresponding costs for patent applications are over 20% higher than in the US, 13 times higher than in the Japan Patent Office, while the costs of maintaining a patent protection in the 27 Member States is over 60 times higher in the EU than the US - frightening implications. Perhaps you could tell us, Commissioner, how we could resolve this as soon as possible?
We must be aware that for the ERI, it is necessary to have legal frameworks and also adequate funding, but that this money cannot come from contributions made by individual regions, or even countries. The question of appropriate taxation is also important in this case. I also think that better cooperation is needed between research centres and the economy, including small and medium-sized enterprises. I am convinced that the ERI will also contribute, if it is properly correlated with the framework programmes, to improving the situation of the people who work in research, and especially young people, as Mr Gierek has said. This may also prevent a brain drain in Europe. We should remember that the Lisbon Strategy provides for a share of three per cent of GDP for expenditure on research and development. In the European Union today - my figures are for the year 2007 - that indicator stands at 1.84%. I trust, therefore, that the ERI will improve this situation.
Ms Doyle, as regards public funding, the experience of the past has shown that, in times of crisis, private financing most likely goes down. That is why public financing should not make the terrible mistake of following that pattern because that would be the way which, after the crisis, would lead us to a completely improper situation. That is why public financing has to act counter-cyclically and that is why, even in Europe, we have had that kind of example. Finland was the case at the beginning of the 1990s. I think we should do something like that and we should follow that path.
Concerning VAT, I would like to be precise. We do not propose VAT exemption in the legislation. We believe that if more countries are joining in efforts to build a common infrastructure, say between Germany and Slovenia or the United Kingdom or anywhere, then at the end of the day, none of the countries will agree to pay VAT in that country. That is the case also today - but what exactly is the case today? Today, the countries are individually negotiating with the host country on that kind of exemption. What we are trying to do, via that legislation, is to guarantee the status of an international organisation which would, as a consequence, due to the VAT legislation which exists today, guarantee VAT exemption.
Mr President, I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate for their contributions, and also I would like to thank the Commissioner for his words and say that I entirely agree with his very clear explanation regarding the VAT issue. To conclude, I would simply like to say that the majority of us are in agreement with the basics. The message is clear: excellence in research requires high quality research infrastructure and, basically due to high construction and operational costs, it is important to share a large proportion of this research infrastructure. In other words, it is more than reasonable to think about creating European infrastructure that can serve the whole European scientific community.
The roadmap drawn up by ESFRI was certainly a step forward towards better planning of research infrastructure at European level. What we need to do now is implement this roadmap. One of the main problems is certainly funding, as some of my colleagues have pointed out, because despite the increase in the funding allocated to the Seventh Framework Programme and the possibilities of support for the infrastructures in the cohesion policy programmes, which some of my colleagues have also mentioned, the European Union budget is not sufficient to fund all of the necessary infrastructure. It is therefore essential that we mobilise sources of funding, both national and private, as far as possible, especially from industry, although as the Commissioner rightly said, this is not a very good time.
We ask that the Member States define precisely the term 'information' by allowing workers' representatives to examine the data supplied and not to content themselves with awaiting the end of the information procedure if the companies' decisions have direct consequences for the workers. Member States without effective, proportionate and deterrent sanctions are asked to introduce them. Finally, in an improved coordination of the different legislative instruments, we also invite the Commission to examine what is required to coordinate the six directives and the regulation on informing employees, so that any amendments to get rid of overlaps and contradictions can be made.
The second objective is to confirm that this is not a marginal sector or an exception; rather it is firmly established in the market economy, with its own rules that the internal market must recognise and respect. It represents an alternative way of doing business, of producing, consuming and providing employment, that has nonetheless earned the right to be part of the market. It is a method characterised by a number of distinctive traits that must not be smoothed over and that consist primarily of the desire to combine and reconcile production and employment with values of solidarity, responsibility and human dignity in all areas including the world of work.
Now is the ideal time to rediscover the relevance of these businesses, as the current crisis in manufacturing has shown many traditional economic actors to be very fragile, very weak and sometimes very unscrupulous. The world of the social economy is, by contrast, more locally rooted, closer to the real economy and to people and therefore protected from speculation, as has proved the case. It is also a sector with a wide range of actors who do a lot of welfare work, and constitutes a recognised hub of social utility. It can, I believe, help to sustain our social systems when times are hard.
The third objective is to decide what we can do in practice to support this sector. I will very briefly describe one or two proposals. First of all, we need a clear definition to accurately understand the profiles and definitions of these highly diverse entities. It is also crucial to record the contribution made by this sector accurately in national statistics in different countries. It does not belong to either the capitalist economy or the public economy, and therefore requires its own definition. The Commission has gone some way towards this with its handbook, but it needs to be applied. I believe that the world of academia, research and universities can also help with this.
Finally, some legislative initiatives are called for. A number of things have been done, such as the cooperative statute and the foundation statute, and I see that the Commission has reopened its consultation. So, we need to understand what is useful and whether it is worthwhile continuing along this route. We do not want to bog down a sector that thrives on ideas, motivation and freedom with paperwork, but where Community laws are needed, or will be needed in future, it would be wise to create them.
Social economy enterprises have a unique way of doing business since they combine economic performance mutually between members, and often also the achievement of social and societal objectives, as a business purpose. Thus, they are well placed to contribute to Community policies and objectives, particularly in the field of employment, social cohesion, regional and rural development, environmental protection, consumer protection and social security. Social economy enterprises are an integral part of the Commission's enterprise policy. Since, in the majority, they are micro, small or medium-sized enterprises, they already benefit from the Small Business Act and all actions targeting small enterprises.
With regard to the social economy, our objective is to create a legal and administrative environment, at European level and in every Member State, in which social economy enterprises of whatever form and size can thrive and meet the challenges posed by globalisation and the economic downturn. More specifically, the Commission's policy aims to guarantee that social economy enterprises can grow and prosper alongside other forms of company. To this end, the Commission pays particular attention to ensuring that all other Community policies in areas such as competition, accounting, company law, public procurement, health, social affairs, agriculture, fisheries, banking, insurance, public and private partnerships and regional development, do take into account the specific needs, particular goals, efforts and working style of this kind of enterprise.
in writing. - First of all, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Patrizia Toia, for the quality of the report she presents today. As a matter of fact, it is important to provide some clarity in defining the concept of social economy and ensuring its legal status through the wide range of national experiences. Social economy indeed requires visibility - through better knowledge of EU-wide data - for better achieving the objectives of solidarity, employment, entrepreneurship, growth, competitiveness social cohesion and social dialogue in the Union as a whole. Social economy is increasingly becoming an important actor at local and regional levels and has now, more than ever - due to the serious impacts of the financial crisis - a major role to play in European social and economic development. The Union needs to concentrate its efforts in supporting the social and economic dynamics to overcome the mere separation of public and private sectors if we really want to find new and innovative solutions to provide our citizens with sustainable jobs and a better living environment with quality services of general interest in an inclusive society.
We have been trying to mobilise all the EU institutions and resources for several months in order to alleviate the effects of the growing crisis. The silver lining of this dark cloud is that Mrs Patrizia Toia's report is now on the agenda of the plenary session, since initiatives focusing on solidarity, as well as on social and regional cohesion, are especially important these days. This is the focus of the social economy, as the latter is a conglomeration of organisational forms whose goal is solidarity and common financial interest, instead of profit. Such institutions cannot be replaced by any market-oriented organisation. They provide an opportunity to reduce the effects of economic stratification on the marginalised members of society, provide honourable work, and with their various forms ranging from self-employment to social cooperatives, they are able to reapply the fruits of their labours to the benefit of the community.
Also, in an ageing Europe, neurodegenerative disorders are becoming ever more common. We will therefore all agree that there is a need to take a concerted approach to the challenges posed by mental health and that it concerns us all. We all have an obligation to defend mental health and safeguarding the rights of mental patients and their families is an ideological and political position whereby the state provides social support and protection to those who need it. The first step was the Commission's Green Paper; the next step was the European Conference 'Together for Mental Health and Wellbeing', which also established the European Pact for Mental Health and Wellbeing.
In the report, we stress the need to provide high-quality, accessible, effective and universal mental health services and up-to-date legislation. We call for emphasis to be placed on the training of everyone in key positions. We call for access to appropriate education, training and employment and for the creation of a supportive environment, with particular emphasis on vulnerable groups. We call for emphasis to be placed on the prevention of mental ill-health through social intervention. We call for the Member States to empower organisations which represent people with mental health problems. We propose the adoption of a platform to monitor the implementation of the Pact. We call on the Commission to present the conclusions of the thematic conferences. We stress the need to produce appropriate indicators with a view to improving the assessment of needs at national and European level.
At the same time, we are formulating proposals within the framework of the five priority areas of the Pact. Within this framework, we stress that, in order to prevent depression and suicide, we need to implement multi-sectoral programmes and set up networks, to develop a healthy climate in schools, to improve working conditions, to adopt measures to improve the quality of life and, finally, as regards combating stigma and social exclusion, we stress that public information and awareness campaigns are needed. For this, I should like to thank the members who contributed with their proposals and I hope that we shall send out a message that mental health is a valuable social commodity and that we all need to work to promote it.
Employers are increasingly aware of the links between wellbeing and productivity. CSR Europe has even created a toolkit for wellbeing in the workplace. However, let us be clear. There can certainly be no reason for complacency, and much more remains to be done. There could be new risks for mental health as a result of the current financial and economic crisis. Member States could be tempted to reduce budgets for mental health or to reduce their efforts to build up modern mental health systems with community-based services instead of outdated asylums.
Over the next two years, the Commission will organise a series of thematic conferences on the five priorities of the mental health pact. These will be joint events with Council Presidencies and Member States. A first international conference on stigma and psychiatric care will be organised by the Czech Presidency on 29 May this year. The first thematic conference on mental health in youth and education will take place in Stockholm on 29-30 September, in cooperation with the Swedish Presidency. The second thematic conference on the prevention of depression and suicide will be organised with Hungary in December. In the first semester of 2010, the Spanish Presidency will host a thematic conference on the mental health of older people. Furthermore, we are in contact with Member States regarding two further conferences on mental health in workplace settings and on combating stigma and social exclusion.
One in four people suffer from mental health problems at least once in their life. It is estimated that by the year 2020, depression will have become the most common illness in the developed world and the second main reason for incapacity for work. External factors, such as the consequences of the present financial crisis, will tend to make people vulnerable to these problems. Not only does mental ill-health entail an expense that is a burden on the healthcare sector and the entire social and economic system; it also detracts from the quality of life of sufferers and their families to an unnecessary degree.
As we know, mental health is a fundamental value for every person, and we, the representatives of the nations of Europe, must not forget this fact. I think it is a good thing that, today, we have turned to this issue in the forum of the European Parliament. Mental illnesses, a flood of suicides and depression have become a threat to contemporary society. These problems do not only affect people who live under constant stress, but also children, young people and the elderly. I think that we should take far-reaching steps to defeat these diseases of civilisation. This is also why I support research and free access to the results of this research, as well as specialists.
In expressing my thanks for the Report on Mental Health, I would, at the same time, like to express my concern regarding whether it is possible, in addition to providing assistance to the elderly, and action to combat stigmatisation and social exclusion, to also include projects aimed at reaching people who are socially marginalised. Such people very often display antipathy towards others, feel alienated, and have a fear of the censure of society. In my opinion, the first problem we should focus on is an extensive education programme so that everyone who is in need will know where to turn, what kind of help can be obtained and, most importantly, that it is possible to return to a normal life.
In the past few years, the Commission has stated very clearly that energy efficiency is the first priority of the European Union energy policy and a very important cornerstone to meeting the 2020 by 2020 targets, and National Energy Efficiency Action Plans play a central role in this respect. The Directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services sets an obligation, as you know, for the Member States to present these, and to show how, in practice, they are going to achieve their national targets for energy efficiency.
At this stage, the Commission has completed all the individual assessments and sent letters with the results of those assessments to all Member States. As a follow-up, a number of bilateral meetings took place, and a number of Member States declared they would themselves like to improve their NEEAPs in the coming few months. As has been noted by the members of the ITRE Committee, the first National Energy Efficiency Action Plans have proved to be a really useful exercise. Indeed, many Member States have, for the first time, prepared comprehensive plans of action on energy savings. Many of them confirmed that they found the cross-sectoral effort needed to prepare them very useful.
In conclusion, I would like to recall that during the mandate of this Commission, EU leaders have given a real commitment to promoting energy efficiency. Boosting investment in energy efficiency and related new technologies offers an essential contribution to sustainable development and also to security of supply. Energy efficiency has a wider impact, far beyond energy policy. It has a positive effect on the European Union economy in general: increasing efficiency helps create new jobs, stimulates economic growth and improves competitiveness. As you rightly mentioned, that is exactly what we should be doing in these difficult and challenging times.
The dependency of EU Member States, in particular EU 'energy islands', on the import of energy supplies and existing infrastructure varies. Can we talk of a single energy market, if, for example, the Baltic States, including Lithuania, are energy islands? Europe's inability to speak to the main energy suppliers with one voice is also an acute problem. On paper, we are creating an ambitious European energy policy but, in practice, the bilateral energy policy continues to dominate. Fellow Members, the politicisation of the energy sector does not contribute to stability. We could and should try to change the situation through diversification and solidarity. We must complete the missing energy links and establish an EU coordinating mechanism, aimed at reacting to similar crises. It is essential that Member States which are most dependent on energy supplies have sufficient reserves of these supplies. We must not only look at short-term measures for security of energy supply, but we must also consider the long-term outlook. Europe in turn must diversify energy sources and improve security of supply.
I firmly believe that the R&D sector must be supported as this can make a significant contribution to boosting energy efficiency. The Commission and Member State governments should give stronger support to projects intended to boost energy efficiency, whether we are talking about investments to make public transport as energy efficient as possible, insulating buildings, etc. I think that government resources should be channelled more in this direction rather than towards subsidising the price of energy, as these projects provide, at the same time, support to vulnerable consumers faced with rising energy prices.
Experience from the first assessment of the national action plans demonstrates in practice that conditions in the EU have not yet matured to the point at which measures to promote energy efficiency can be supported. One important weakness in the first energy efficiency national action plans, over and above the huge delay in submitting them on the part of certain Member States, including Greece, is the fact that the ambitious plans are not accompanied by clearly defined practical proposals with added value, despite the fact that, according to recent figures released by the European Commission, if the target of achieving energy savings of 20% were achieved, the EU would use approximately 400 Mtoe less primary energy and CO2 emissions would fall by 860 Mt.
Consequently, the scope of the potential which promoting energy efficiency gives us, especially at a time of economic recession such as the one we are experiencing now, has not been fully understood. The EU should therefore proceed without further delay to include energy efficiency in all its sectoral policies, with clear proposals and support measures, and to increase Community aid in this direction. Energy efficiency is a key point following the adoption of the package on climate change and can guarantee energy security, a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and an invigorated European economy.
Moreover, Commissioner, scientists - and I assure you that I have talked to many of them in order to draw up this report, both before and during the process - have problems when submitting projects to the Seventh Framework Programme. These problems can partly be attributed, on the one hand, to the different focus that is required for aquaculture, which is basically industrial in nature, and on the other hand, to research into fisheries and marine science, which is multidisciplinary in nature and more long term.
It is vital that we establish interesting and rewarding university courses that offer good professional opportunities. It also seems that we need to standardise the different research models applied in the various Member States in order to be able to better compare the results and facilitate the aggregation of data, and to increase cooperation between national research institutions. Of course, I also think that better incorporation of the experience and expertise of fishers into the process of drawing up scientific opinions, on which political decisions as part of the CFP are to be based, is vital.
If I can add a sentence of my own, I can guarantee to you that it is not more complicated than it was before, simply because the same people are working on it and the cooperation which we have with my colleague, Mr Borg, is really excellent. I think that is how research should be done in the future. We are cooperating across sectors and this is really bringing better results, which could hardly have been the case if this were done in a more sectoral way. I honestly thank you for the great work you have done.
President of the Czech Republic. - (CS) I would like first of all to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in the European Parliament, which is one of the key institutions of the European Union. Although I have been here several times before I have never had the chance to address a plenary session. I therefore appreciate the chance to do so today. The elected representatives of 27 countries with their broad spectrum of political opinions and views constitute a unique audience, just as the European Union itself has been a unique and essentially revolutionary experiment for over half a century, attempting to improve decision making in Europe through transferring a significant part of the decision-making process from individual states to pan-European institutions.
The last time a Czech president addressed you from this place was nine years ago. He was my predecessor in the role, Václav Havel, and it was four years before our accession to the EU. Some weeks ago, the Czech premier, Mirek Topolánek, also spoke here, this time as the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the EU. In his speech he focused on specific topics arising from the priorities of the Czech presidency and the problems currently confronting the countries of the European Union.
In just under three months, the Czech Republic will commemorate the fifth anniversary of its accession to the EU and it will do so in a dignified manner. It will mark the anniversary as a country which, in contrast to some other new Member States, does not feel disappointed over the unfulfilled expectations of membership. There is nothing surprising about this and there is a rational explanation for it. Our expectations were realistic. We were well aware that we were joining a community created by and composed of people and not some sort of ideal construct developed without authentic human interests, ambitions, opinions and ideas. Interests and ideas are to be found at every step in the European Union and that is how it should be.
We saw our entry into the EU, on the one hand, as external confirmation of the fact that we had relatively quickly, over the course of almost fifteen years since the fall of communism, become a normal European country again. On the other hand, we considered - and we still do consider - the chance to participate actively in the European integration process as an opportunity to benefit from the advantages of an already highly integrated Europe while at the same time contributing our own ideas to the process. We assume our own share of responsibility for the development of the European Union and it is precisely with this in mind that we accede to our presidency of the Council of the European Union. I firmly believe that the first six weeks of our presidency have convincingly demonstrated our responsible approach.
I would also like to repeat out loud and very clearly here in this forum, and for the benefit of those of you that either did not know or did not want to know, my conviction that for us there was not and is not any alternative to EU membership and that there is no relevant political movement in our country that would be able or willing to undermine this position. We have therefore been taken aback recently by the repeated and growing attacks against the Czechs based on the completely unfounded assumption that we are looking for a different integration project than the one we joined six years ago. This is not the case.
The citizens of the Czech Republic take it for granted that European integration has a necessary and important mission, which broadly speaking they understand in the following way. It is firstly to remove barriers which are unnecessary and counterproductive to human freedom and prosperity, hindering the movement of persons, goods and services, ideas, political philosophies, world views, cultural plans and behavioural models, which, over the course of time, have formed between various European countries for many different reasons, and secondly to exercise joint care for public assets that are of significance to the entire continent or such projects as cannot be implemented effectively through just bilateral agreements between two or more neighbouring European countries.
The effort to implement these two aims - removing barriers and making rational choices over issues that should be resolved at European level - is not and never will be completed. The various barriers and obstacles still remain and there is definitely more decision making at the Brussels level than there ideally should be. There is certainly more of it than people in the various Member States want. You are surely well aware of this too, ladies and gentlemen. I would therefore like to ask in a rhetorical sense whether you are certain each time you vote that you are deciding on a matter that should be decided on in this house rather than closer to the citizens, in other words within the individual European states? Other potential impacts of European integration are also discussed in today's politically correct rhetoric, but these tend to be of a secondary and irrelevant nature. They have more to do with the ambitions of professional politicians and the people connected with them than with the interests of ordinary Member State citizens.
I said earlier that for the Czechs there was and there continues to be no alternative to EU membership - and I am delighted to emphasise and underline this - but that is only half of what I would like to say. The other half comprises the completely logical assertion that a range of potential and legitimate alternatives exists in respect of the methods and forms of European integration, just as it has done throughout the past half century. History has no end point. To claim that the status quo, in other words the current institutional arrangements of the EU, is a dogma forever beyond criticism is an error which unfortunately continues to proliferate, even though it is in direct conflict both with rational thinking and with the entire historical development of over two thousand years of European civilisation. The assumption that an 'ever closer Union', in other words an ever deeper political integration of the Member States, represents the only possible and correct course of development for the European Union is a similar error, which is postulated a priori and is therefore similarly beyond criticism.
Citizens of all Member States surely want these things but, over the course of the 20 years since the fall of communism, it has repeatedly been confirmed that they are wanted more and cared about more by those people who have experienced tyranny for a large part of the twentieth century and who have suffered the effects of a dysfunctional, centrally planned, state-run economy. Those people are quite legitimately more sensitive and more aware of manifestations or tendencies pointing to ends other than freedom and prosperity. And those people include the citizens of the Czech Republic.
The current system for decision making in the EU differs from the historically tried and tested traditional form of parliamentary democracy. In a normal parliamentary system there is a group supporting the government and another supporting the opposition. However, unless I am mistaken, this is not the case in the European Parliament. Here only one alternative exists and those who dare consider other alternatives are labelled enemies of European integration. In my part of Europe, we lived until relatively recently under a political system where no alternatives were allowed and where no parliamentary opposition therefore existed. We learned through bitter experience that where there is no opposition, there is no freedom. This is why political alternatives must exist.
That is not all. The relationship between the citizens of the various Member States and their EU representatives is not the normal relationship between voters and the politicians representing them. There is more distance between EU citizens and their representatives than is the case within individual Member States, and not only in the geographical sense of the word. This is often referred to in various ways: the democratic deficit, the loss of democratic accountability, decision making by the un-elected but selected officials, the bureaucratisation of decision making and so on. The proposed changes to the status quo contained in the rejected European Constitution or the not-so-different Treaty of Lisbon would only exacerbate this defect.
Since there is no European demos, no European nation, this defect cannot be solved by strengthening the role of the European Parliament. This would only make the problem worse and would lead to Member State citizens feeling ever more alienated from EU institutions. The solution does not lie in trying to breathe new life into the current form of European integration, or in trying to suppress the role of Member States in the name of a new multi-cultural and multi-national European civil society. These are attempts that have failed in the past because they were not natural historical developments.
I am afraid that attempts to speed up and deepen integration and to shift decision making affecting living standards of Member State citizens more and more to a European level may have repercussions endangering everything positive that has been achieved in Europe over the past half century. Therefore let us not underestimate the concerns felt by many Member State citizens that decisions affecting their lives will be taken elsewhere and without their involvement and that their ability to influence the decision-making process is very limited. The success of the EU to date is due among other things to the fact that the opinion and voice of every Member State had the same weight in voting and thus could not be ignored. Let us not allow a situation to come about in which Member State citizens live their lives with a resigned feeling that the EU project is not their own, that it is not developing as they would like and that they are obliged merely to resign themselves to it. We could very easily and very quickly find ourselves once again living under conditions we now habitually regard as a thing of the past.
This is also closely connected to the question of prosperity. It must be said openly that the current economic system of the EU involves constraints on the market and a constant strengthening of a centrally-controlled economy. Although history has given us ample evidence that this path leads nowhere, we are following it again. The level of restrictions on the spontaneity of market processes and the level of political regulation over the economy are constantly increasing. This development has recently been further reinforced by incorrect interpretations of the causes of the current financial and economic crisis, attributing it to the market rather than to the actual cause which was, on the contrary, political manipulation of the market. It is again necessary to remember the historical experience of my part of Europe and the lessons we have learned.
Many of you will certainly be familiar with the name of the 19th-century French economist, Frederic Bastiat and his famous Petition from the Manufacturers of Candles, which is still a well-known standard text to this day, illustrating the absurdity of political interference in the economy. On 14 November 2008, the European Commission approved a real petition from manufacturers of candles, not just a Bastiat-style fiction, and imposed a 66% tax on candles imported from China. I could not believe that a 160-year-old literary essay had become a reality, but that is precisely what happened. The inevitable consequence of introducing such measures on a broad scale is that Europe will fall behind economically and that economic growth will slow down or even grind to a halt. The only solution lies in the liberalisation and deregulation of the European economy.
The most important thing at this point is clearly to make sure that we do not equate the open discussion of these matters with an attack on the very idea of European integration. We have always believed that being allowed to discuss these serious questions, being heard, defending everyone's right to put forward alternatives to the one correct opinion, no matter how much we may disagree with them, is precisely the kind of democracy that was denied us for four decades. We, who have involuntarily spent the greater part of our lives witnessing how the free exchange of ideas is a basic precondition for a healthy democracy, believe that this precondition will be honoured and respected in the future as well. This represents an opportunity and an irreplaceable way of making the EU freer, more democratic and more prosperous.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are one European family and, as in any family, there are differences of opinion. Mr President, I agree with you when you say - I only wish to make a few comments, but I feel obliged to do so - : we are a human community. A human community is characterised by having advantages, strengths, disadvantages and weaknesses. Together, we must strengthen the strengths and eradicate the weaknesses. I also agree with you when you say that we need to ask whether each decision that we take could perhaps have been taken elsewhere. Yes, but our national capitals must also ask themselves whether many decisions should not be taken in our towns and communities rather than at national level.
Allow me to make one final comment relating to our Parliament's understanding of itself: we thank you for your acknowledgement that this European Parliament is an important institution. If we were not so influential, we would not currently be the legislator in 75% of cases and we would not be a co-legislator in almost 100% of cases with regard to the Treaty of Lisbon, and then it would, in fact, be the case that decisions in Europe would be made by bureaucratic means. However, it is now the European Parliament that decides.
I would like to say a few words in relation to these three reports, which are all part of the same package, which includes the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Saryusz-Wolski. At the moment we are looking for solutions to the financial crisis. That was self-inflicted and we are saying this crisis must not be repeated, but what about the raison d'être of the European Union to prevent wars and human crises? They must not be repeated either, and they do not fall on us like the roof in the Parliament building in Strasbourg. They need not be repeated, but only on the condition that we work together.
I remind you that peace is not the monopoly of this side of the House. Peace belongs to everybody. Peace-building is our common duty. It is a little bit like love. It is unconditional. We have to be idealistic in this life. We have to look far away, like when we run in a forest. You do not look at your feet when you run in a forest. You look far away and then you know where you are going and you automatically put your feet in the right place. That is what we have to do. We have to be brutally honest and remember why the EU was formed: it was to build peace.
(DE) Madam President, there are indeed differences of interpretation. The legal interpretation by the Committee on Development is opposed to the interpretation by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and it is opposed to the legal interpretation by the legal services of our Parliament, to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to the view of the Council and the Commission, and therefore we, in the majority, insist on using the legal base as set out in this amendment.
Those who carried out that deed will probably not listen to any words of condemnation that I say. But I have to say this: they can never succeed - they cannot win - because it is the democratic process in Northern Ireland that has spoken, and that must win. Though it may at times have faults, it has brought a different life to my people in Northern Ireland: they have found a better life, they have experienced that better life, and I want to see them continue with that better life. I add my words of sympathy to the families to your own.
Mr President, I too condemn unreservedly the killing of two British soldiers and the injuring of four others outside the Massereene barracks in the town of Antrim last Saturday. The Real IRA, a fringe republican group in Northern Ireland, has claimed responsibility for this horrific attack, which is the first deadly attack on Northern Ireland security forces for 12 years. Those who perpetrated these terrorist acts must be brought to justice and made to account for their horrific crimes. Their attacks do not command political support from the people of Northern Ireland.
Those who murdered the two soldiers seek political advance through the path of violence. I wish I could say that they will not succeed but, sadly, in Northern Ireland it seems that violence does pay - so much so that today we have three convicted IRA terrorists as government ministers, and our joint first minister McGuinness is someone who Peter Robinson - at a time when he opposed terrorists in government - said had personally murdered at least 12 soldiers. He is no better than or different to the Antrim terrorists who stood over the dying soldiers and pumped more bullets into their bodies.
A hundred years ago, 15 000 women demonstrated in New York for the recognition of their dignity and rights. We pay tribute to their legacy today. There is no doubt that a great deal has been accomplished since then in terms of the recognition and protection of women's rights and the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women in all areas of society. We must not let up in our endeavours; a great deal more must be done to realise gender equality within the European Union and also to increase the participation of women in work, civil society and politics. In the opinion of the European Parliament, there is scope for further increasing the present degree of participation by women in decision-making at local, national and European Union level. Our Member States must find ways of encouraging and supporting women's participation in the decision-making process and in politics at both national and international level.
We are only a few months away from the European elections. I wish to emphasise today that the participation of women in these elections and balanced gender representation in the European Parliament are particularly important both to the democratic development of the European Union and to our society as a whole. In conclusion, I should like to remind the House that many wars on this earth hit many women particularly hard, and we are working to prevent the use of harassment and rape of women as weapons of war. We must defend the dignity of all the people of this earth and must never let up in our commitment.
(EL) Mr President, the adverse impact of the global financial crisis can now be seen in international trade. One need only note that the rate of growth in global trade fell from 8.5% in 2006 to 5.5% in 2007 and was in the order of just 4% in 2008. A special mechanism has been introduced within the framework of the World Trade Organisation to monitor the measures that have been and are being adopted by the Member States of the organisation in order to support the sectors of the economy that have been hit.
The democratic credibility of the current government may be cast in doubt in the case of the two councillors from Braşov's local municipal council, Vasile Bran and Iulian Mara, who were elected by local citizens and whose position has not been formalised eight months after the local elections. Vasile Bran's election was unjustifiably invalidated by the decision of the local council, while Iulian Mara could not take the oath as the decision which validated his position was contested through administrative legal proceedings by the Prefect's Institution for Braşov County.
According to recent reports in the magazine Stern, at least 76 German MEPs were members of this fund. This relates only to the association's list, however, not to the fund. I hereby call on you, Mr Pöttering, as President of Parliament, to send the complete list of fund members to the administration of the lower house of the German Parliament as, under the relevant regulations in your home country, the suspicion of serious fraud would automatically arise if it were to turn out that duplicate payments had been made. This must then be followed by the relevant investigations, and the German authorities have a right to learn of this from you.
(DE) Madam President, we are going to be dealing with - though unfortunately not debating - the report by Mrs Kósáné Kovács concerning the Roma issue. I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the issue given the very difficult situation at present. There have been a number of incidents in Hungary, but the problem is not limited to that country, where the economic crisis and the social problems perhaps explain the renewed increase in attacks on Roma. This is something that is particularly reprehensible. Several Roma - including Austrian Roma - have approached me and asked me to bring this up, as fear has gripped the Roma community in Europe once again. I should like to urge the Commission, too, to monitor the situation very closely and to do all it can to ensure that the Roma - and other minorities too, but here we are particularly talking about the Roma - do not need to live in fear again in Europe: they should not have to do so in this day and age.
In the region around Vilnius over 70% of the population are Polish. Until now, the names of streets and towns were bilingual, as they are in many countries of the European Union with national minorities. Not long ago, the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania judged the placing of street name signs in Polish alongside signs with Lithuanian names to be illegal, and ordered their removal. The local government in Vilnius has implemented this decision - the Polish street names in the region where most residents are from the Polish minority have been removed.
(HU) In recent days, perhaps partly on account of the crisis, popular opinion in the Member States that acceded in the last five years has responded with increasing sensitivity to any step that might call into question or discredit the equal status and identical standards of their membership within the Union. As regards my own electoral district, we have heard accusations on Swedish television and then on the internet that, in the village of Harkakötöny, the way geese are plucked constitutes cruelty to animals, whereas, in fact, no geese have been bred there or in the place mentioned for years. I am glad that a charge of libel has been filed regarding this matter. Similar libellous statements were made recently against breeders in my country concerning force-feeding of geese. These statements called for a boycott against the processors that has caused economic damages. Interestingly, no such accusations have been levelled against the old Member States. These are actions taken out of economic interest, but another, uniquely political form of defamation consists of statements alleging ethnically-based attacks against the Roma population in Hungary as if these were matters of fact, although to date it has for the most part been impossible to provide proof that such attacks have indeed taken place. I ask the Commission to monitor such polemics closely and especially not to spread them, since such statements could seriously discredit the European Union's prestige in my country in the run-up to the elections.
This conflicts with the practice to date and also with internationally guaranteed minority rights. In the EU every minority community has the natural right to learn its own history. Hungarian teachers, and indeed the entire Hungarian community in Slovakia, are justifiably outraged. It is unacceptable for an extremist party to be constantly putting pressure on minorities in this way. It is irresponsible during a global economic crisis for someone to feel the need to provoke ethnic minorities. It is playing with fire to behave like this in times of such uncertainty.
(SV) Madam President, many, like me, are concerned about the growing anti-Semitism in Europe. Over the weekend, a Davis Cup tennis match between Sweden and Israel was played in my home town of Malmö. It was no ordinary match. It was played without spectators because the local political leadership felt it could not guarantee security, a view that many of us have criticised. There were demonstrations in connection with the match, one of which was very violent. Certainly, it is legitimate to criticise the policies of the state of Israel, but this criticism must not turn into hatred towards Jews in general, in other words into anti-Semitism.
This Parliament asked for the economic blockade to be lifted, but, to a very large extent, it continues. Week after week, the collective punishment of Palestinian people is maintained by the Israelis. Our words are fine, but they have little value while Israel refuses to listen. Madam Vice-President, I ask you to ask the President to call a meeting of the group leaders and his cabinet to consider how our words can be turned into deeds. I face the question all the time from my constituents: 'You have an Association Agreement with Israel. How is it that we maintain this relationship with one side, while that party ignores our interests and treats our words with such contempt?'
(GA) Madam President, dairy farmers are in a very difficult situation. The price of a litre of milk has fallen to between 22 and 24 cent, and there has been a sudden drop in worldwide demand for dairy products, particularly in Asia and in China as a result of the melamine scandal. There are around twenty thousand dairy farmers in Ireland and thirty thousand people directly employed as a result of this. There has also been a 3% increase in production in the United States alone, as well as an increase in production in Brazil. Another problem is the exchange rate between the euro and the pound sterling. It is clear that short term aid must be provided to the farmers to help them survive. One thing that should be done is that an intervention scheme should be brought in, as has proven very successful in the past.
Such objectives are just as relevant in an economic crisis, but equality policy should focus on men as well. The crisis has an impact on the labour market. There are expectations that many of them will lose their jobs because of their higher salary and the reduction in labour-intensive activities in the finance sector. There is a growing likelihood that men will have greater involvement in family life and a breakthrough is occurring among traditional social roles. To what extent they are ready for this and whether the social adjustments can facilitate such a change are questions which will need to be answered.
(HU) I have spoken up several times on behalf of the traditional national minorities. Some of my colleagues have accused me of nationalism. It is strange that the majority often tries to disguise its fear and anti-minority sentiment with accusations of nationalism or hate speech against minorities. I hope my colleagues will not mind if I now speak up on behalf of a religious minority. The Romanian Greek Catholic Church was banned during the Communist era. After 1990, it was reorganised and, similarly to other historical churches, it is trying to this day to recover its confiscated immovable property. In Romania, a law is being drafted that, if adopted, would in effect take away this church's real estate, currently in the process of being reclaimed. I would like to call attention from this microphone to the twisted nature of this situation, to the way rights are being trampled on and to this disguised attempt at nationalisation. It is unacceptable for the state to interfere detrimentally in the life of a church.
(BG) Thank you, Madam President. I would like to raise an issue which is a cause of deep distress. Over the last two weeks we have been hearing reports from the Republic of Macedonia where certain church authorities expressed a desire to exhume the bodies of Bulgarian soldiers who died on that country's territory in all wars throughout the 20th century. The Bulgarian general public, and I am sure the same is true of the European general public, regard such calls as absolutely unacceptable. No one has the right to make a mockery of the memory of those who have perished in wars. What we must do is pay them honour and respect, observe the basic European principle of honouring the dead and keep to the best traditions of tolerance that we have.
This offer of a separate company form is particularly directed at Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. Up to now, only large companies have had their own company form, namely the European company. I believe that such a proposal was long overdue. As this is aimed at SMEs, and start-ups - that is, companies that arise from the idea of starting up a company rather than as a result of the transformation, division or merger of existing or other companies - must also be provided for, we also welcome the European Commission's restraint with regard to the requirements imposed on the cross-border component. This has, I believe, also been expressed by Parliament in this report.
We also believe that we are in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice in the matter of whether the company's seat must be identical to its registered office or seat of administration; that is, that only one company seat can be envisaged. I know that there is a minority opinion on the subject in this House, but the majority opinion in Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs - from which I assume plenary will take its lead tomorrow - is that there must definitely be the possibility of a separation and that a European company form cannot be disadvantaged in relation to national company forms, which have this possibility under the case law of the European Court of Justice.
A major problem, which required lengthy negotiations, was the situation with regard to employee participation. We have had considerable difficulties with this in the past when dealing with other legal acts under company law. I need only mention the European company and the Directive on cross-border mergers. I believe that, thanks to the compromise amendments signed by the three largest political groups in this House, we have succeeded in finding a real solution to this problem; a solution which draws on the successful elements of previous legal acts in the European Union, which represents a compromise between the different legal situations in the Member States, and which also makes a contribution to protecting employees' rights.
My final comment concerns the 14th Directive, for which I am also rapporteur. The story is similar to that of the European company. Our aim is to use this legislative motion for a resolution to compel the Commission to make a tangible proposal, as we did in the case of the EPC, and indeed we expect the Commission to do so, so as to close one of the last gaps in company law and guarantee freedom of establishment for undertakings. My sincere thanks for your attention.
rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are reaching the end of a long process, a long and successful process through which we have been able to move small and medium-sized enterprises from the periphery to the centre. It has been a long process for us to reach the point where this internal market, although unified, is not homogeneous. A long road, at the end of which we see that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises operate with the same administrative burdens and rules as the 41 thousand large European companies, even though the former are unable to enter the market under anything like the same conditions.
It seems to us that the Commission, under Commissioner Verheugen's leadership, has come a long way over the past five years, and thus we welcome the change in philosophy within the European Union, intended to eliminate the hurdles facing SMEs both at EU level and in the Member States. One possibility for increasing the turnover of SMEs is to enable more and more of them to enter the European internal market, since at present only 8% of enterprises do so, and only 15% of their turnover is generated on that market. Their turnover could increase if they were able to participate much more extensively in innovative research and development programmes and projects. It would help the market activities of small businesses if sources of funding and financing were made much more readily accessible than at present. Their turnover could increase if we were at last to create a Community patent, thus preventing cheap counterfeit products from squeezing out intellectual property produced by small businesses.
I believe that the most sensitive challenge from the perspective of the success of the entire Lisbon Strategy is certainly to help SMEs move from their own Member State to the EU internal market. In the current economic situation, however, we need to point out, over and above what has been said, that there are problems with the major source of financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. For that source continues to be credit. The increased risk sensitivity of financial institutions has meant, however, that more and more companies have difficulty accessing credit. Invoking the uncertainty of the economic situation, the banks are holding back on making loans in these circles. Directors of SMEs complain that thousands of companies and tens of thousands of workplaces may be endangered. It is fundamentally in our interest to ensure that the funds intended to inject liquidity into the system reach the economy rather than remain in bank safes. One of the most important steps is for banks to begin to stimulate the economy and SMEs as soon as possible.
The other challenge is to create European solidarity. This is the only way to offer more effective protection than what nation states can provide to SMEs that are in difficulty because of the crisis. In saying this, I want to point out that the situation of SMEs and the way this is handled is also a test of European solidarity. It shows that Europe is capable of assuming shared risk with Member States beyond the euro zone as well. The measures aimed principally at stabilising the euro area can easily give rise - and have already given rise - to a financial vacuum in the non-euro zone. In the current situation, therefore, I must ask European decision-makers and the representatives of the banking sector not to allow for the creation of a two-speed Europe, since the collapse of a region where SMEs play a decisive role - constituting more than 90% of all businesses - would bring with it catastrophic economic consequences. I request the support of the Commission and of my fellow Members to this end. I thank my fellow rapporteur, Nicole Fontaine, and the other shadow rapporteurs for their work, and once again congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for the achievements to date.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the two rapporteurs. Ladies first, and not only these days, I will start by thanking Ms Herczog for the quality of her report on the Small Business Act (SBA) and the strong support it provides for the Commission's initiative to establish a comprehensive policy on small- and medium-sized enterprises. I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lehne, not only for his efficiency and work in steering the Private Company Statute through the consultation procedure, but also for the interesting and creative solutions presented in the report.
The SBA includes a set of legislative initiatives, including the proposal for a European private company statute. The SBA is designed to ensure that the 'think small first' principle and priority for small businesses are lastingly and irreversibly anchored in policy-making across the Union. The SBA also calls for greater recognition of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs. We need people who are prepared to take initiatives, draft projects and take risks more than ever at times like this. We also believe, therefore, that honest entrepreneurs who suffer business failure deserve a second chance.
The Private Company Statute is a key element of the Small Business Act. It is designed for SMEs. Therefore, the Commission proposed that a European private company may be set up just like any domestic company, without the requirement for doing business in different Member States or having shareholders from more than one country - just like at home. There are those who consider such a cross-border requirement essential for a European company forum. Parliament's resolution, which allows companies a choice between a variety of cross-border elements, is flexible. European private companies could comply with this requirement, for example by setting up a foreign subsidiary or by simply recording their intention to do cross-border business.
Finally, regarding the cross-border transfer of the seat of companies: the Commission has informed Parliament on previous occasions of its reasons for not proposing the 14th Company Law Directive. These reasons are still valid. We agree with the rapporteur that companies should enjoy freedom of establishment within the single market and be able to move their seats from one country to another. However, we are not convinced that proposing new legislation now is the best solution to achieve this objective. Court of Justice case-law clearly allows for company mobility. In addition, existing legislation - the Cross-Border Mergers Directive - provides a framework for the transfer, including the necessary safeguards for third parties. In particular, the Cross-Border Mergers Directive allows a company to set up a new subsidiary in another country and then merge its existing company with that subsidiary. The transfer procedure and safeguards suggested by the Committee on Legal Affairs are very similar to those put forward by the Directive.
Our economic analyses show that the level of complexity of the cross-border transfer procedure would be comparable to that of the cross-border merger procedure. The Cross-Border Mergers Directive was due to be transposed by Member States by December 2007. It is too early to assess its full application. Before embarking on any new legislation, the Commission should first evaluate how this new existing regulatory framework operates in practice. We are also not convinced that the Directive would improve the existing situation under national law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice in this area.
What we are intending to do here with the Statute for a European private company - and I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal and the rapporteur for her work - is to open up the internal market for small businesses to the same extent as for large companies. It is in this regard that new ground needs to be broken. As we discussed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it is a matter of carrying out a thorough simplification of the rules, which will open up doors for small businesses.
It is about ensuring that small businesses can be involved in public procurement to the same extent as large companies as a result of the way that public procurement is carried out. It is about making it easier for small businesses to operate across borders, including with regard to matters such as paying VAT, and about combating the bureaucracy that is currently proving prohibitive. It is also about providing European financial markets with better conditions for expansion and growth by providing a better credit market for small businesses through the efforts of the European Investment Bank and others. Finally, I would like to say that
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, the proposal presented by the Commission for the European private company within the framework of the Small Business Act had serious weaknesses. It paid scant regard to the interests of creditors, employees, consumers and small suppliers. To mention a few of its provisions, it envisaged minimum capital of EUR 1 and, in addition, inadequate registration procedures, no requirement for cross-border activity, and the separation of the articles of association, the seat and the actual place of business.
One of my most important demands - the 'SME test' for legislative initiatives - also gained the support of the committee responsible. Bureaucracy must be nipped in the bud. Impact assessments are to be carried out systematically in the case of new laws. Before their adoption, all EU provisions must be examined in terms of their impact on SMEs. It is important to me that the results of this SME test be subject to an independent evaluation by an independent body, and this idea has been incorporated into the text.
The first is that Member States must announce how and in what timeframe they will incorporate the core elements of the 'Think Small First' principle into national legislation. Secondly, Member States should, on a compulsory basis, present the progress made on the implementation of the 'Think Small First' principle in the annual reports on the Lisbon process national reform programmes. Thirdly, we need standard criteria for the measurement of progress in the implementation of the 'Think Small First' principle. Then, fourthly, we must establish the 'Think Small First' principle as an obligatory component of future legislation at European level, too. In addition, in response to current events, I would say that all existing regulations should be examined in terms of their pro-cyclical impact on SMEs. We need to act quickly on this.
This obviously showed the governments' strong political will and, today, I would like to welcome the excellent report by Mrs Herczog which extends this impetus in such a timely way. I would like also to express my thanks for the quality of the cooperation that we have received and the excellent work that, I must say, we have achieved in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Today we have only put forward two amendments in the plenary session. This shows how well we did our work.
Firstly, I regret that the Commissioner's colleague, Mr McCreevy, is not here - I think the horse racing season may have started again! I really regret it because the subject of company law is really important for us and is at the heart of his portfolio. Secondly, Commissioner, I really regret your arguments against Parliament's proposals on the co-determination of employees. We clearly stated that this is not meant for small companies, but that the SPE Statute is available for all companies. It is not restricted to size. We do not want this SPE Statute to be a way of abusing and circumventing existing legislation - particularly in national traditions - something which is a very important aspect of co-determination. We do not want 'shopping around' to exist and a new Delaware to be created in the European Union, where companies can circumvent this type of legislation.
Fourthly, we tabled a resolution together to ask the Commission to consult the social partners on the basis of Article 138. This would have been proper before we decided on a regulation concerning the SPE, because co-determination is an issue which is dealt with under Article 138 of the EC Treaty and which first requires a consultation of social partners. This has not been done. We now ask for it to be done immediately afterwards. However, if I hear this type of reaction from the Commission, I will seriously reconsider and suggest to my group that we reconsider whether we can support the SPE product. Perhaps you should make some phone calls tonight to Mr McCreevy and Mr Špidla and see whether tomorrow you can present a better proposal on this before the vote.
Briefly - because I am now using up my speaking time - the PSE's position is not against the chance for small and medium-sized enterprises to get this new statute - we are in favour of that - but it is against this form of abuse. We found a very good compromise with the rapporteur. It is also very up-to-date and is not at all obsolete, but very topical at this time, considering the disastrous workings of shareholders and financial markets, to consider a better way of governance for companies, in which employees have a part. Commissioner, you really have to consider with your College and with the Commissioners in charge whether you can make a more positive statement to the Parliament.
Secondly, these kinds of transfers should, conversely, contribute to protecting the existing rights of shareholders, creditors, and especially the rights of employees. I would also like to express the hope that the solutions proposed by the rapporteur, involving the drawing up a transfer proposal, and especially a report explaining and justifying the legal and, above all, the economic aspects of the proposed move of the company's seat, and its implications for shareholders and employees, will not prove to be an additional obstacle to the transfer of companies.
Unfortunately, it is totally different now that it has arrived, accompanied by the European private company. First, take the size of the target enterprises. In place of small enterprise, the already vaguer concept of small and medium-sized enterprises has slipped in. This has led finally, and I am reading from the explanatory statement of the draft regulation adopted by the Commission, to a 'statute that can also benefit larger companies and groups'. This totally changes the philosophy of the policy, and now what will happen to these pseudo-SMEs? In truth, they will be subsidiaries of multinationals who, as we know, have long been demanding a single, less binding statute than what currently applies to the companies they control in the various European countries.
Let us look now at the nature of the benefits offered to companies by the EPC statute. It is no longer a question of giving easier access to public contracts. Rather, and again I am reading from the explanatory statement of the Commission's text, its aim is now 'to improve the framework conditions for businesses in the Single Market'. To this end, all European Private Companies could have their registered office in one country and their real activities in another. They could also transfer their registered office to any Member State they choose.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must resolve this crisis of small and medium-sized enterprises in an authentically European way. We are witnessing a plague striking small and medium-sized enterprises across the whole continent, caused by a lack of access to credit. The problem is that the banks are not lending to businesses, and it is also true that the attempts of some governments to finance the banks so that they, in turn, will finance small businesses, are failing because no one knows what debts the banks are in fact suffering at this time.
I therefore propose that the national states, by nationalising their national banks, advocate printing money, or vouchers corresponding to money, to finance small businesses. An attempt of this kind was recently made in the Republic of Taiwan, which issued vouchers that for all intents and purposes correspond to money, and gave them, in the form of personal vouchers, to Taiwanese citizens. This meant that, for all intents and purposes, USD or EUR 3 billion was issued in the Republic of Taiwan.
As Mrs van den Burg said, and I believe that Mr Wurtz also highlighted the point in his criticism of the proposal, the European private company statute, as conceived in the Commission proposal and as approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs, is an instrument for the creation of undertakings which may be large and which have certain characteristics, such as limitation of the liability of the partners and the prohibition on trading in these undertakings on public markets. Both European private company status and national private company status, however, may apply to small businesses or to large ones.
As Mrs van den Burg said, it is precisely the flexibility or malleability of the European private company that means we must be extremely cautious. This has been the task of the Committee on Legal Affairs. The amendments adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which are quite numerous, are designed precisely to prevent the European private company formula from forming a basis for, as Mrs van den Burg was saying, the emergence of a European Delaware. This is particularly relevant to one of the subjects of concern to Mr Wurtz: workers' participation in companies.
I think that the wordings adopted within the Committee on Legal Affairs point out these restrictions clearly. It is not a question, as Mr Wurtz was saying, of applying the country of origin rule, but rather, in accordance with the rules that we adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs - and I would recommend that Mr Wurtz read the amendments we adopted - there is a set of restrictions preventing the country of origin rules from applying to those companies in which there is a higher level of workers' participation than normal. They are included in full in the amendments that we have adopted and I believe that, with these amendments, it is wholly admissible to adopt the text, even from Mr Wurtz's viewpoint.
Also, the cutting of red tape and bureaucracy by the Commission has to be welcomed. That amounts to savings for the European Union of about EUR 2.3 million. I had a meeting recently with Commissioner Verheugen where we discussed with Irish business people the problems that they faced. One idea that should be looked at is that of maybe having a moratorium on new red tape coming from Europe, because that is stifling business. During these difficult times, we have to do everything we possibly can to make sure that businesses survive until the hoped-for upturn.
The regulation, which is directly applicable in the Member States, is the natural complement to the Bolkestein directive and the anti-labour judgments handed down by the European Court of Justice in the Viking, Laval and Ruffert cases. It is a consequence and the result of the Maastricht Treaty and of the application of the four freedoms. The European private company exposes the political powers that voted for Maastricht, which tried to deceive the workers when they voted for the Bolkestein directive by lying and saying that it allegedly did not affect workers' rights.
Hence, I would repeat a call I have made before that during the currency of this economic downturn, there should be a regulation holiday for SMEs. The cost of EU regulation in the United Kingdom has been reckoned to be GBP 107 billion over the last ten years. That is GBP 107 billion that should have been going into innovation, into intensified export efforts and into growth. Yet much of that has had to be spent on mere compliance with regulation. The simplification of procurement procedures, reducing patent costs, relaxation on state aid rules and real action against unfair competition from the Far East are all essential if SMEs are to flourish.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many Members have raised the subject of participation. I do not wish to go more deeply into this now, but I do want to point out in this connection that our Member States' company law also has the function of defending the interests of public policy, such as creditor protection, security of the legal system and consumer protection, a function that is safeguarded in the Member States by administration of preventive justice, for example by means of form and register provisions. There are major differences between Member States in this regard.
The decisions of the Committee on Legal Affairs take account of this in many places - which is to be warmly welcomed - by leaving Member States' options open. Ultimately, however, these things are counteracted, or at least can be counteracted, unless we do something about the fact that the registered office and the actual seat - that is, the actual place of business of the company - are allowed to differ, as this ultimately renders these safeguards meaningless. The company can locate its registered office practically at will, and thus evade the requirements of the country where it really does business. In my opinion, Member States thereby de facto - although not de jure - lose a great deal of sovereignty over their company law and its regulatory function, as these can be invalidated.
I wish to add that this will - or rather could - also jeopardise the reputation of the European private company, at least in the Member States with stricter requirements of their own. One could suggest that we wait and see what happens and then make the necessary adjustments, and I would agree with them if this development were not reinforced by the procedures and the unanimity. That is my greatest concern. There is no reason for this course of action. The case-law of the European Court of Justice is only a stopgap measure because we do not have a directive on the transfer of company seats; but, in the form currently envisaged, this European private company would basically reinforce this disintegration - enshrining it in Community law once and for all. For this reason, I would ask the Council to reconsider this issue very carefully.
The Small Business Act contains legislative proposals and political agreements that will give rise to administrative, regulatory and financial conditions with the potential to develop these units within the European economy. The current crisis and the instability of the financial system are restricting SMEs' access to credit, and this is slowing down their usual economic activity. Now, more than ever, we need a coordinated response at European level and the initiatives of the Member States ought to be structured in terms of and aligned with the provisions of the document we are discussing today.
As we adopt the Act in Parliament, I believe the primary message should be to say to SMEs that Parliament and the European institutions are standing by them and want to strengthen the will and capacity for resistance that small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe are now demonstrating in the face of this storm. We want to reinforce this by indicating the priorities of this support and by saying practical things: calling for more flexibility in the law, and for tools to be made available that will create an environment less hostile to these companies.
(PL) Madam President, the financial crisis, and the resulting economic crisis, are inducing employers to attempt to alter the legal status of their firms to reduce costs, including costs connected with employees' rights and social obligations. That is why they are looking to register their companies' offices in countries where regulations and economic conditions create cost-cutting opportunities, because the legal requirements, such as the minimum wage or pension contributions, are lower. Information contained in the report draws attention to the fact that the cross-border transfer of companies' registered offices should not lead to companies avoiding legal, social or tax regulations. Labour rights must not be violated. We cannot allow social standards to slip. A different means of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises should be be found, such as the provision of loans.
- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in Mrs Herczog's report on SMEs we are talking about 70% of jobs and 70% of VAT receipts in the EU. I would therefore like to express not only my enormous appreciation for the initiative of the rapporteur but also my support. In the current crisis SMEs are clearly in the high risk category. We must therefore promote better social awareness of SMEs. They constantly encounter a range of obstacles. It is much harder for them to obtain loans than it is for large corporations. The administrative and bureaucratic burden is also heavier for SMEs. It is always much harder for SMEs to win public contracts in Europe than it is in the US and many Asian countries. We assert that they are essential to the health of the European economy. Let us therefore give them what they need to confirm this, opportunities in the current period when the crisis is spreading as a result of the domino effect set off by the financial giants and multinational companies.
(PL) Madam President, the adoption of a statute for a European private company will enable the creation of these companies, which will operate in all Member States on an equal basis. The aim, above all, is to remove the current burdensome regulations for small and medium-sized enterprises operating internationally. To run such an operation, SMEs are de facto forced to found a company in the target country. This process, in view of the fact that there are 27 different legal systems in the EU, clearly generates huge costs. In the case of a European private company, the owners will be able to register their business in the same form, irrespective of whether they are operating in their own home country, or in any other Member State. The time and money saved on legal advice, management and administrative procedures will undoubtedly make the process simpler and more convenient for entrepreneurs looking to invest.
One of the main fears that sceptics have concerns the lack of a requirement for the company to own a sufficient amount of share capital to protect creditors. Nothing could be further from the truth. Limited companies provide proof of the fact that a company can be successful without the need for share capital - they are the most popular kind of company in the world. In today's world, share capital has lost its most important function, namely that of protecting creditors. In the case of a European private company, that protection is provided by other mechanisms, based mainly on the increased transparency of its operations and closer cooperation with creditors. Today, commercial partners themselves do not pay as much attention to share capital as to the flow of capital, known as cashflows, which reveal much more about the solvency of a company than capital alone.
There is still the question of employees' rights - it is especially in this context that trade unions are concerned about abandoning previously achieved standards. However, I consider this to be a false alarm. The proposed statute contains an unambiguous provision, according to which employee participation takes place in accordance with national legal regulations. The attractiveness of the European private company could be threatened by the threshold for employee participation being set too low. I think the minimum level of 500 employees should be maintained, so as not to burden smaller enterprises with additional costs.
In addition to making it easier for small businesses to participate in public procurement by providing better access to the internal market, making it easier to obtain capital and making the rules on state aid non-discriminatory, there must also be a change in attitude permeating all decision-making, in schools, universities and the workplace. Research shows that there is a strong correlation between entrepreneurship and growth. The forthcoming Swedish Presidency will, in particular, be making targeted efforts to facilitate enterprise by women, an important European strategy for the future.
The minimum capital stock of EUR 10 000, proposed by the Commission, may benefit the company's image by providing a certain level of credibility. On the other hand, this amount is more difficult to raise in some Member States than in others. Share capital should not be a serious barrier to starting a business and therefore I endorse the compromise amendment adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which sets the minimum capital stock of a European private company at EUR 1, but is accompanied by a requirement stipulating that the company's managing body must sign a statement of solvency.
Regarding the question of employee participation in the enterprise, this should be decided by the law of the country where the company has its registered office. However, an exception should be made to this rule if the right of participation of a certain number of employees of the company, which would apply in the Member State where they actually work, would be restricted by the law in force in the country where the European company is registered. In this case, the management of the enterprise would be obliged to create a uniform system of participation, as part of an agreement negotiated with employee representatives.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this report we try to underline the importance of SMEs, including family businesses and those integrated in the social economy. I want to congratulate my colleague, Edit Herczog, as her report is vital in this respect. Other documents and texts have been produced in this area and it is important that they agree. For example, I would mention the European Eurostars Programme and the report on pre-commercial procurement.
Madam President, this report also underlines the many ways of cutting red tape to make it easier to set up this type of enterprise, in order to take advantage of their capacity for initiative, start up new businesses, manufacture new products, provide new services suited to the needs of consumers and other businesses, and thus boost the development of the European economy. I also want to mention something that is very important in my opinion: this is the issue referred to in paragraph 47 of the Herczog report. It is advisable for certain aspects of the legal and fiscal system of the Member States to be improved in this respect, as the current model in most Member States can discourage the transfer of businesses, particularly family businesses, thus increasing the risk of liquidation or closure of the company. Member States must therefore carefully review their legal and fiscal framework to improve the conditions for the transfer of businesses and to promote and apply effective models for the transfer of businesses to employees as an alternative to their closure. This approach would allow jobs to be protected and profits to be reinvested in order to better develop these businesses.
It must be highlighted that we attach, first and foremost, special importance to SMEs and entrepreneurship among women, and because we have just celebrated International Women's Day on 8 March, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my best wishes to them. However, we must emphasise that this is a fairly complex act in which we have included everything we could include relating to SMEs: cutting red tape and attaching particular importance to research and development activities within SMEs and to the finances relating to these activities.
Specifically, I consider it important for the sake of the Member States that we require them to report on progress in their annual Lisbon reports. Otherwise, the majority of the good recommendations made herein will remain a dead letter. I also agree with Edit Herczog that preferential treatment of the new Member States, and especially of those outside the euro zone, is an important political consequence of this whole exercise. They are in a particularly difficult situation beyond even the generally disadvantageous status of small and medium-sized enterprises, and yet they could play an extremely important role in overcoming the crisis.
To cite only a few elements of the internal market: it is indeed of concern that only 8% of SMEs engage in cross-border activities; this percentage must be increased. Mentorship is particularly important in encouraging such activities. This could be accomplished, on the one hand, by reducing administrative burdens, and on the other hand, through activities involving VAT, such as a one-stop shop system or a reduced VAT rate. Furthermore, we need to promote a stronger SME orientation in public procurement at the Community level as well, for instance by selecting SMEs more often as lead contractors, or by issuing calls for tender intended specifically for them.
The SME Circle, of which I am President, would emphatically like to see results in the establishment of a thorough guarantee and credit system at EU level. I hope that the new European Investment Bank (EIB) opportunity will fulfil the hopes placed in it. As for the rapid implementation of the payment directives and in order to resolve the debt situation, coordinated steps must be taken at Member State level. All in all, both in order to find new markets and to deal with administrative challenges, Member States' efforts to strengthen a mentor system and EU support for such a venture must come quickly.
I think it is a mistake to introduce worker participation at such a level, in other words in such small companies. I understand perfectly well the attachment to a system of social and economic management which has proven its worth. I think that, in this case, we are losing some of the effectiveness of the statute we are proposing and that is going to be adopted, by imposing worker participation systems on small companies when such systems, I feel, are only suitable for large companies. However, aside from this reservation, I think that this text is excellent.
However, those studies are wrong on three counts. First, they exaggerate the amount of legislation that is adopted at EU level instead of national level, quoting 50% or more whereas most national studies show it to be between 6 and 15%. Secondly, they take no account of the fact that EU legislation, when we get it right, cuts costs to businesses and cuts red tape by having a single set of standards - common rules for the common market - instead of 27 divergent and separate ones. Thirdly, they take no account of the fact that when we do impose costs, it is often deliberate in order to save money downstream. When we require cigarettes to have a health warning system, or when we require asbestos to be phased out of our products and our workplaces, it is in order to cut health costs and save lives for people downstream.
Madam President, it is a pity that Mr Toubon is leaving the room, because I wanted to respond to an accusation he made concerning our compromise: namely that it requires new heavy burdens on SMEs. In fact, in the compromise, the status quo is being resettled for mergers, divisions of companies and transfers of seats. Regarding new companies starting from scratch, there is a fairly high threshold for companies with fewer than 500 employees. Those with between 500 and 1 000 employees have exactly what is in the other directives. One cannot say that this is making the status quo even heavier; it is making it lighter. In this consultation with the social partners, we want to look at simplification and a better system which is harmonised all over the EU.
I am pleased that, since 2007, we have been working together with DG Enterprise and Commissioner Verheugen on entrepreneurial education, which is very much needed in Europe and lags behind many other areas. I could quote many examples of good instruments - such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs - but do not want to speak on these just now. It is a process of many issues around access to finance. The EIB is now freeing up space and volume for credits: EUR 30 billion for SMEs, EUR 1 billion a year more for medium-sized corporations, and an additional EUR 1 billion for mezzanine financing.
The issue of consultations and worker participation has been much discussed here - and not only today. As part of its preparations, the Commission conducted, between July and October 2007, a public consultation on the potential SPE. Representatives of trade unions, including European trade unions, presented their views at conferences, especially during 2008. A major conference was held in March 2008, and we discussed these questions with experts from European trade unions several times that year. I want to underline one important thing, which is the legal basis. This is not Article 138, because we are not in the field of social policy, but Article 308, making it a different initiative based on unanimity of the Member States. There was no reason to launch a specific consultation under the former article.
I would conclude by saying that this is the European Year of Creativity and Innovation, and that it is very important to have an approach which brings forward the creative potential of our businesses. People are very important, not only because there is a crisis, but because there is no greater potential than that of human beings. Issues such as IPRs or the Community patent could in the near future be addressed through a more open-minded and open-hearted political approach. Europe could be more innovative and creative in supporting SMEs.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to make four comments. Firstly, with regard to the directive on the transfer of registered offices, I think that the Commission should abandon its argument, as it runs the risk of making itself a laughing stock among experts. The theory that transfers of company seats can be arranged such that a company is started up in a neighbouring country and then one's own company merged with it under the Directive on mergers could scarcely be more bureaucratic. We are talking here about reducing bureaucracy and trying to make things easier for SMEs. This proposal just goes to prove how little sense it makes for the Commission to persist in refusing to present a proposal on the 14th Directive. This benefits no one but lawyers.
The fourth thing I want to say is that the argument on the part of left-wing Members - none of whom stayed for the debate earlier on - that the proposal should be rejected does not take account of the substance of the report - Mr Medina Ortega is absolutely right about this. The substance of the report actually takes care of all the criticism that has been presented. Therefore, I would suggest that the left-wing Members, too, consider rereading the report and the amendments and then discussing them once again with their group.
rapporteur. - Madam President, it is a great pity that all of my voters are not here in the room, because it was wonderful to listen to so many Members from so many countries and so many parties welcoming my report on the Small Business Act. However, I have to say that my report would not have been possible without the Commission, namely Mr Verheugen and his small business team, Mrs Le Bail and others. I would also not have been able to do it without the Small Business Intergroup.
The second aspect is linked to the status of women running small businesses. In many respects, they do not differ significantly from employees. Reasons for this can be the lack of development of services facilitating the balance between private life and work activities, as well as the tough competitive environment in which networks matter very much. Such networks, which facilitate the flow of information and can provide support, if needed, are a feature of businesses run by men, whereas women are more vulnerable from this point of view. For this reason, links must be encouraged between businesses run by women and those run by men.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last year the number of refugees worldwide has increased. The figure now stands at approximately 12 million. If we include those who are internally displaced, this rises to more than 26 million people worldwide who are in need of the same kind of protection. The reason for this is that wars continue to exist in the world; at present there are 4 million Iraqi refugees and displaced people, and it is clear that these refugees are a consequence of wars that our countries played a part in starting.
The creation of a common European asylum policy is necessary because, under the rule of law, we have an obligation to guarantee that these people are received equally throughout the European Union. This becomes all the more important if we consider that some Member States do not yet have a systematic law on asylum. I note with regret that harmonisation of asylum procedures has been deferred for two years, meaning that it will be implemented in 2012. We must put an end to the awful disparity that exists between the Member States and the different asylum systems. We are at present in a paradoxical situation whereby recognition rates of candidates to refugee status for certain third country nationals vary from approximately 0% up to 90% depending on which Member State receives the request.
Harmonisation of standards should result in a high level of protection throughout the EU and should not be based on the lowest common denominator. The institution of asylum is an essential part of our democracy and the protection of human rights, and it is unacceptable that it has been severely eroded in recent years, as the needs of asylum seekers and the principle of non-refoulement laid down in international conventions have not always been respected. The European Union should provide for mechanisms at the external borders to identify asylum seekers and ensure that persons entitled to international protection gain access to its territory, including in the context of its external border control operations. For this reason we consider it appropriate to review the role of Frontex, which often handles asylum seekers as if they were illegal immigrants.
With this report, the European Parliament is asking Frontex to provide detailed data relating to the number of asylum seekers identified as such during its operations and the plight of persons intercepted and sent back to a country of transit or origin. We must ensure that international conventions are correctly applied, as well as cooperation agreements with third countries. Agreements cannot be made with countries that have not signed the Geneva Convention. Many Member States ignore this, however, including Italy, which has signed an agreement on managing migration flows with Libya, a country that does not intend to sign the Geneva Convention on refugees.
Asylum seekers are vulnerable people who require appropriate reception conditions. Member States cannot detain people for the sole reason that they are applying for international protection. I would therefore argue, as a matter of principle, that asylum seekers should not be detained. Unfortunately in many Member States the detention of asylum seekers is still a reality, due to the fact that they enter the country illegally. Regrettably, and I will conclude with this point, there is no other way to enter the European Union. This is the paradox: even asylum seekers must be subject to mixed flows to enter the EU. Asylum is not a concession: asylum is a duty for states and a right for those fleeing war.
The best asylum procedure would be useless if access to such a procedure were not guaranteed. I agree with you, Mr Catania, on the need to improve our work with border officials, to train them and make them aware of asylum issues. You mentioned mixed flows. Frontex really needs to be able to undertake this training task. Once established, the support office will contribute to this by preparing manuals for border officials. We must also arrive at a better definition of responsibilities in the case of people rescued at sea. Where should they disembark? Where, if need be, could they ask for asylum? I am working with the Member States to try to find the right answers to these questions. Naturally, one has to be aware of the pressures the asylum systems are under in some Member States. We want greater solidarity, not only in financial terms, but also in the form of teams of rapid response experts, created by the office.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (LT) In recent years, the number of refugees worldwide has reached 16 million. In 2007, the EU received more than 200 000 asylum applications. Both refugees requesting asylum and some Member States are facing problems, and a great burden which the European Common Asylum System would alleviate. Government institutions should apply concrete, clear and equal terms when deciding whether asylum applications should be accepted. It is important for refugee status to be granted on the basis of a concrete case, rather than a general assessment, based on nationality for example. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the European Commission's Policy Plan on Asylum does not mention the Frontex agency, which plays a very important role in the area of refugee protection. Moreover, it is important to mention that the number of asylum applicants depends directly on the political, economic and social situation in the countries of origin of the asylum applicants. Therefore, the Common European Asylum System should be closely linked to the European Development Cooperation Policy and humanitarian work, which would reduce the number of asylum applicants, seekers, who are often economic migrants.
In 2008, as already highlighted by the rapporteur, the number of refugees grew to over 12 million. We therefore urgently need to begin the second phase of the Common European Asylum System. There can only be an identical level of protection throughout the EU if a single asylum application procedure is established, for reasons of efficiency, rapidity, quality and justice in decision-making, together with single standards for qualification as refugees or persons needing international protection. Only in this way can asylum seekers be treated equally, regardless of the Member State in which they make their asylum application.
I am therefore delighted at the presentation of this asylum action plan, to which various public players have contributed and which defines the road map to be followed in coming years with a view to developing the Common European Asylum System. I support the proposed amendments to the Reception Conditions Directive, to the Asylum Procedures Directive and to the Asylum Qualification Directive in order to clarify the criteria allowing asylum seekers to qualify for international protection. I am pleased that Commissioner Barrot has underlined the need to ensure coherence with other policies impacting on international protection, and I hope that this same coherent approach will be extended to other common areas.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I support the report of the rapporteur and the work of the Commission. There is no excuse for the poor state of refugee management in the EU, since the numbers of asylum applications are low by historical standards. Lack of common practice, different sources of country-of-origin information and failure to implement EU laws properly means there is an uneven playing field. This is causing shopping-around by applicants and pass-the-parcel by states.
Obliging EU states to allow asylum seekers to work after six months, if their claim is not decided, is very important: they would retain dignity and also pay tax. I am very disappointed the UK has decided to opt out from an improved Reception Conditions Directive as that would bar automatic detention solely on the grounds of submission of an asylum claim, cut across UK fast-track detention and enforce the right to work after six months. It is pretty shameful, in my view, that my own country regards these conditions as too onerous.
Madam President, we should once again wholeheartedly thank the French Presidency, which made great progress on the question of asylum when it brought about adoption of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum by the Council in October of last year. It is true that the European Union needs a common asylum policy and needs to develop an attitude of solidarity in relation to admitting refugees. EU Member States which are especially exposed to an influx of asylum seekers should be provided with assistance. The question of asylum is a very delicate one. It is difficult to judge who really needs protection and who is trying to escape poverty in their own country, and, while the latter also deserve help, we cannot admit everyone. In summary, our EU procedures should be unified, transparent and fast.
Almost every week we hear horrific reports from refugee camps in southern Europe. Those who have ended up there live in terrible conditions, to which the authorities choose to turn a blind eye. The problem is clearly not the individuals detained in the camps, but rather the fact that human rights are not being respected, despite the fact that all Member States, at least in theory, meet the Copenhagen criteria. This is the issue we should instead be discussing here in Parliament. Access to a country's territory has to be a matter for each country to take decisions on, but international conventions and agreements must, of course, be respected.
Yesterday was International Women's Day. The issue that I have been involved with during this parliamentary term is how different countries treat women and children caught up in people trafficking, that is to say whether these people have a right to stay in the EU or to receive help to return home. When the Social Democrats governed Sweden it was a foregone conclusion that women who had been violated in Sweden - irrespective of whether it was a result of people trafficking, marriage or whether they had been subjected to violence - had a right to stay. Now, a woman may possibly be allowed to stay, but only if she cooperates with the police and prosecutors. For what crimes other than people trafficking is cooperation a requirement for asylum? I think that this is discrimination against women and children and I would like to address this issue today, following Women's Day.
The third issue is how different countries receive asylum seekers and which countries are chosen. My country, Sweden, is one of the countries that have accepted the most refugees from Iraq. Compared with both the US and Canada, it is an enormous amount, and the same is true in comparison with most EU countries. I hope that the new asylum system in the EU will be better prepared to accept joint responsibility when something happens in the world or, as in the case of Iraq, when countries are invaded. It should not be the case that an EU system based on solidarity only functions when things are calm - it must also function in times of crisis and conflict.
What we can be sure of is that over the coming months and years there will be yet more refugees and asylum-seekers. It will surprise no-one that the European Parliament solution is harmonisation of national asylum systems. The report proposes a common European asylum system and a common asylum support office with common standards for granting refugee and asylum status. It proposes that national governments should not be able to hold an asylum-seeker in detention solely on the grounds that they are asylum applicants, and that refugees should be allowed to request movement from one European country to another. It proposes that where an applicant is held in detention, that person should have the right to a remedy before a national court.
(MT) The rapporteur was right in saying that a common asylum policy must be built upon the solidarity principle. It is precisely this solidarity that is lacking in our asylum policy, as Commissioner Barrot will personally observe later this week when he visits my country of Malta, as well as the island of Lampedusa. Commissioner, you will discover that the solidarity you seek will elude you. Solidarity was introduced for the first time in the Immigration and Asylum Pact last October. It was entered by way of a clause on burden-sharing, which focused on distributing the load amongst countries. This was the first time it had been introduced and it was a positive move. This clause is applied on a voluntary basis and allows migrants that arrive in one country seeking asylum to be able to transfer to another European Union country. This Parliament even allocated EUR 5 million in this year's European Union budget so as to facilitate the implementation of this clause. Until now, in practice, we have not witnessed the application of this clause except in the case of France, which offered to take 80 asylum seekers from Malta. This is an important gesture, but other European Union countries did not follow suit, which is a great pity. Therefore, my question to the Commissioner is, what action is the Commission taking to guarantee that this mechanism on burden sharing is being executed? What is it doing to ensure that more countries offer their solidarity and take immigrants from a country that is shouldering a disproportionate burden? Does the Commission intend to draw up a European reallocation programme between countries and how does it plan to build upon and apply this clause?
- (CS) Madam President, I profoundly disagree with the Euro-sceptic campaign against the common migration and asylum policy enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. We need to act jointly and more firmly to combat illegal economic migration, while providing more dignified conditions to asylum seekers. It troubles me that the children of refugees in European camps have no access to education or necessary health care for months at a time. It is also unacceptable that within the Schengen area some countries recognise the status of refugees and others do not. It is regrettable that the Frontex agency does not monitor the numbers and countries of origin of applicants for international protection. Yes, we do need a unified asylum procedure and we also need to help the buffer states on the basis of solidarity. We must also, however, link asylum policy with development policy in order to preclude migration.
I would like to give some clarifications. First, some of you have mentioned Frontex, Mr Catania in particular. I have to tell you that Frontex now has a liaison officer in the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This is a real effort on the part of Frontex to understand fully the problems affecting asylum seekers, and the Commission has proposed rules to improve the definition of Frontex responsibilities in maritime operations. We are currently in discussions with the Member States on this important issue.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members who have spoken in support of this report, as well as Mr Barrot for his support and the work the Commission is undertaking to amend certain directives, particularly the Asylum Procedure Directive, demonstrating a willingness to improve the common asylum system. Parliament acts as co-legislator in this field, and I believe that we must exercise our role in order to harmonise asylum procedures at a higher level, pushing for a system of harmonisation that allows for large numbers to be received and improves standards of reception in the Member States so that the system is increasingly cohesive.
I believe that this Parliament has fulfilled an important role by visiting administrative detention centres in Europe. We have visited a great many of them - Mrs Roure was the rapporteur for the final report - and we have observed that often the right to asylum has been breached in Member States, often normal reception conditions such as the right to healthcare and legal aid have not been guaranteed, and information on potential asylum seekers has not been provided. This has happened because mixed flows have been managed in such a way that the fight against illegal immigration and the defence of external borders has taken precedence over the need for reception and in particular the reception of asylum seekers.
This sphere is, in fact, not a Community one, but an intergovernmental one, in which the Council - through the regulation - has tried to encourage cooperation between the courts. I believe, however, that there has been a certain lack of rigour on the European Union's part in its attempts to achieve this. That is to say, certain measures have been taken, such as the formulation of practical ideas, the use of electronic media, and so on, but I recognise that it is quite difficult for the Commission to act.
The Commission has found that the results are not good, that there is a huge delay in the implementation of these cooperation mechanisms and, therefore, that we do not have the resources to achieve this. The ideal solution would be to use physical means. For example, what could the Commission do to equip courts, particularly those at a lower level, with technological facilities such as videoconferencing systems? Videoconferencing might be an idea that seems out of reach in many small courts within the European Union, but it appears to be the only way of achieving this.
What can we do from the practical point of view to help the judges with regard to interpreting and translation? What could we do to help them to achieve this? In drawing up this report, I am not setting out to take a severe or harsh approach towards the Commission. I think the task is quite a difficult one. What I would like to know, taking advantage of the fact that we have here a Commissioner who is interested in this subject, is what the Commission thinks can be done to give greater rigour to this 2001 regulation, which was a little vague, a little too much based on voluntary action; I do not know whether, from the practical point of view, it can produce any results or whether it will be possible to make progress with it.
IT and videoconferencing, used alongside a secure e-mail system, should, Mr Medina Ortega, be a standard resource for sending evidence. The usual task of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters, as you said, is to facilitate this legal cooperation in Europe. Since it came into force, the implementation of the regulation on the taking of evidence, on several occasions, has been at the centre of the network's work. A handbook on the application of the regulation was produced in 2006 and distributed among all the European courts in 2007. The European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters may, without doubt, use its contacts - you are correct in this, Mr Medina Ortega - to involve itself more deeply in achieving greater compliance with requests to take evidence within the timescales set out in the regulation. That is true.
I want to carry on and briefly examine the outlook. It is true that the regulation sets precise criteria for the form and content of the request. The request must be completed according to a specific form and contain specific information: the name and address of the parties to the proceedings, the nature and the matter of the particular case and a description of the evidence to be supplied. The regulation also states that the request must be presented in one of the official languages of the Member State in the receiving court or in any other language that the receiving Member State has indicated as acceptable but, as you have just underlined, language is not the least of the problems.
The European Parliament is asking the Commission to assess the national laws transposing the directive and to inform it of the effects of the measures taken by the Member States in the wake of the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of auditors. At the appropriate time, we will be happy to prepare these assessments, taking into account all the issues raised in the report by Mr Doorn. This is a commitment from Commissioner McCreevy that I am happy to pass on to you. I thank Mr Doorn and I dare to hope that we will see practical results.
(PT) Madam President, just a brief point of order about the agenda for this week. Wednesday 11 March is the European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. This day was proposed in the first place by Parliament in a vote that took place on 11 March 2004. We were then debating an assessment of the area of freedom, security and justice. It was the day of the tragic attacks in Madrid. It was originally proposed for 11 September but, given the tragedy that occurred on that day, Parliament voted for it to be on 11 March.
The regulation that we are passing today is environmentally friendly since, as part of the CO2 package, it represents an important contribution, on the part of European policy, to the reduction in CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. At the same time, however - and I would call this clever environmental policy - it also helps consumers - drivers - to pay less while, at the same time, acting in an environmentally-friendly manner, as it leads to considerable savings, not only in terms of CO2, but also in terms of the consumption of petrol and diesel. In addition, it also - and this, too, is an important point that was particularly important to Parliament and its Members - leads to improvements in the safety of European roads, and not only in relation to goods vehicles, but in relation to cars as well.
The first point is that, by introducing a mandatory tyre pressure monitoring system for motor vehicles, we will be bringing about a situation whereby better tyre pressure, through an improved driving performance of tyres that the tyre industry is capable of realising, will see drivers in Europe consume up to 5% less fuel without seeing the costs rocket. A tyre pressure monitoring system that is already on the market costs around EUR 100, sometimes significantly less, and the resultant cost savings for consumers will be significantly above that.
The second point that I think merits special attention is the fact that we have succeeded in obtaining the mandatory fitting of a stability system - known as the ESP system - into vehicles as early as 2011 and that we did this not against the will of the European motor industry but with its express participation and support, as this will lead to a considerable improvement in safety on European roads. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the relevant technical specifications were not yet sufficiently ready, we did not manage to also secure the mandatory fitting of the emergency braking systems and the lane departure warning systems - I apologise for these somewhat technical terms, which do not generally come up in the public debate on this issue - by the year 2018 in goods vehicles, in particular. This measure will lead to a significant improvement in the safety of European roads, especially of our motorways. All I can say is that this could reduce the numbers of deaths and injuries by around 35 000.
Finally - and there are still a few differences of opinion on this issue - we have also brought about a situation through this regulation whereby tyres will produce considerably less noise. This does involve some costs, it is true, and for that reason, we thought it was particularly important to include text in the regulation stating that the reduction in noise emissions by road traffic cannot be solely down to tyre manufacturers and, indirectly, consumers, but that it is also a responsibility of the Member States in terms of the road surfaces they provide, and I am extremely grateful that the Council did, in the end, adopt this stipulation.
What we are actually dealing with here is what appears to be a very technical regulation, yet it is a regulation with a large and far-reaching political significance. What we are aiming to adopt today represents a milestone when it comes to improving road safety. This regulation will make European cars safer. It is a milestone in terms of the environmental compatibility of European vehicles, as environmental compatibility, of course, is something that will not only be achieved through producing more fuel-efficient engines - cars also offer other entirely different options for saving fuel and reducing pollution. At the end of the day, it will also form an important part of our policy of better lawmaking, as it will lead to a truly drastic simplification of the entire regulatory environment.
Allow me to begin with the aspect of safety, which was the most important element in this project. Road safety in Europe is still an issue that demands our earnest attention and that causes us great concern. The rules that we are laying down here, and that will apply as standard to European cars from 2011, will lead to 35 000 fewer deaths and serious injuries a year on Europe's roads. The introduction of the electronic stability programme for passenger cars and for commercial vehicles, in particular, can save almost 3 000 lives a year and prevent serious injuries for 25 000 people. This is, ultimately, a piece of safety equipment which, especially when it comes to goods vehicles, which are often involved in serious accidents, has only rarely been used up to now. The costs to manufacturers will be far outweighed by the overall economic benefit.
This package of measures will play a considerable part in implementing the European Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. It makes low rolling resistance tyres mandatory and requires the installation of tyre pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators. These measures will reduce average CO2 emissions by 6 to 7 grams of CO2 per kilometre. That is, therefore, a really very noteworthy contribution. What is more, I do not wish to miss the opportunity to point out that this proposal will lead to a significant reduction in noise pollution from roads since reducing tyre noise levels will bring about a significant improvement in this situation.
When it comes to cars, it is scarcely possible not to mention the fact that the European motor industry currently finds itself in a very serious crisis, the most serious for decades. It is natural, therefore, to wonder whether this is the right time to be implementing technical regulations. Let me be quite clear in my response to that, when I say that what we are aiming to adopt here today is one of the results of the CARS 21 process, in which we worked intensively with manufacturers, the Member States and civil society on how the framework for the European motor industry will look in future and how we envisage the European car of the future. I would like to emphasise strongly that, even in this crisis - and specifically in this crisis, in fact - European manufacturers must not slacken off when it comes to developing and bringing onto the market cars that meet the requirements of the early 21st century, and those requirements are quite clear. Consumers want vehicles that use less fuel, are better for the environment and are safer.
The vision for the European car of the future that resulted from CARS 21, and the common line of all the participants when it came to the future of this industry, is exactly that - what we want is for Europe to send out to face the international competition not only qualitatively the best cars, but also those that consume the least, are the most environmentally friendly and the safest, and I am absolutely convinced that, with products like that, the European industry will retain its leading position in the international vehicles market. Thank you very much.
It is right to clearly class the wet grip, and thus the safety, of tyres as more important than rolling resistance, which helps reduce CO2 emissions. Tyres' rolling resistance, depending on the driving conditions and speed, accounts for 20 to 30% of fuel consumption. It is therefore clear that, given the current environmental debate and in order to reduce petrol costs, a reduction must be achieved. However, it is necessary to realise that, without rolling resistance, which occurs through the deformation of tyres and their elastic properties, safe and comfortable driving would be impossible. We therefore have to see safety in another light here, too. The new developments by the tyre manufacturers show that it is possible to have both safety and lower rolling resistance. In this way, we will also enable the European motor industry to take, and retain, a world lead.
We set down a road map in Cars 21 about the environmental and safety challenges that we expected the industry to meet, and the crucial thing there is to give them stability and knowledge so that they can plan and design their new products in a sensible and sequenced way, albeit with demanding deadlines and targets. We do not want to resile from those challenging targets, but to give them that stability. As Günter Verheugen pointed out, with the industry in such a dire position at the moment because of a lack of demand, that regulatory stability is crucially important.
I would like to highlight two points. Firstly, the agreement to bring in electronic stability control systems at the earliest possible date is a very major contribution to safety and I very much welcome that. Those of us who have had the opportunity to test those systems will understand their efficiency. Secondly, I want to highlight issues around the international framework, the repeal of the EU directives and their incorporation into national legislation. I welcome that, but I think it is now more important than ever, Commissioner, that that process becomes much more transparent about the line the Commission is taking on negotiating those directives which are being done in another body, a UN body, and not within this House.
Last Thursday night, a colleague of ours, Linda McAvan, was involved in a very serious car accident. Her car was destroyed, but she walked away relatively unhurt. This was because the car she was driving had the most modern safety features and this enabled her not to be seriously injured. That is the context in which we are discussing this report. Road safety saves lives, as Commissioner Verheugen commented, and is so important to the well-being of many families in the European Union. We should not lose sight of that, even in these very difficult times.
However, in the current circumstances of the car industry, given that cars are not being sold, it was quite clear in the discussions we had with the Council that, in fact, 12 months was probably unrealistic, and we had to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tyres that are perfectly good and sound. Therefore, we were prepared to accept, in the trialogue, 30 months after the implementation date as being the period before which tyres not meeting the requirements should be sold off. However, thanks to the intervention of Mr Schwab, if the Commission believes that there could be an earlier date, that is provided for in the comitology procedure. This was an important area of strengthening.
The point about safety has been well made. As I say, tyre pressure monitoring systems are very important, because under-inflated tyres - much to my shame, the United Kingdom is one of the worst culprits for having under-inflated tyres - are a cause of accidents. Lane departure warning systems and electronic stability control are also important. I congratulate Mr Schwab on bringing the implementation of these forward by a year, because they will be of major advantage in terms of safety.
As the Commissioner said, this is the consolidation or combination of more than 50 other rules. I welcome this simplification because all over Europe, vehicles that are manufactured need to be of the highest standard and vehicle manufacturers need to be responsible for achieving this standard - not only in relation to car tyres, but also in relation to the other aspects mentioned here this morning, such as electronic control and other modern features which ensure that the cars and the vehicles we put on the road are of the best possible standard.
My thanks to the Czech Presidency, on the other hand, are somewhat more ambivalent. I have to say that we were put under heavy pressure by the Council in this trialogue and that the Council showed little ambition. Quite the opposite, in fact, in that the Council warned us in advance against setting our demands too high so as not to jeopardise the manufacturers in these times of economic crisis. I see this completely differently, and I think that the majority in this Chamber does too - particularly in times of economic crisis, what we need is clear standards and for the European industry to be motivated and given incentives to set its standards high and develop models for the future, and not for the current situation. Energy efficiency and CO2 emissions clearly play a very important role in this.
With regard to the matter before the House, I would have to say that I am rarely lobbied in my constituency in favour of an EU regulation and I suppose I would have to say that on even fewer occasions am I persuaded. On this occasion, however, I was pleased to be persuaded, because this proposal contains provisions which both improve road safety and happily assist a company in Northern Ireland which is at the cutting edge of technology and production of tyre pressure monitoring systems. Thus a proposal which makes the fitting of such systems mandatory is not just good for road safety; it is also good for jobs in my constituency.
(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the high degree of professionalism shown by Mr Schwab in amending the draft regulation of the Commission to include measures which will increase the competitiveness of the European car industry while, at the same time, enabling Member States to monitor effectively market adherence to motor vehicle type approval requirements. For example, by checking tyre pressures, we can reduce fuel consumption and thus also emissions, and by introducing modern electronic drive control systems in 2011, a reduction in the number of accidents on European roads will be achieved one year earlier. Noise reduction is another benefit and one which relates both to tyres and road building. This regulation will reduce the administrative burden and will simplify legal regulations in accordance with the UN agreement on unifying vehicle requirements. This regulation is an excellent example of integrated legislation and I am delighted that the Czech Presidency was well prepared for it and that an agreement between Parliament, Mr Schwab and the Council will therefore be reached at first reading.
It would appear that loopholes are being exploited between that legislation and type approval legislation, which was the tool chosen to implement the directive. I have been alerted over the last few weeks to plans by car manufacturers to avoid any refrigerant change at all, in 2011 and beyond, by applying type approval of certain components. This would mean that the deadline for prohibition of the use of R134a would now be 2017 rather than 2011. Hence, the avoidance of tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions will no longer happen.
National type approval authorities are ultimately responsible for the implementation of the MAC Directive. For example the VCA, which is the type approval authority in the UK, has recently stated that it will approve, after January 2011, new types of vehicles fitted with existing - already approved to Regulation (EC) No 706/2007 standards - MACs containing 'F' gases with a GWP greater than 150. As a consequence, we have evidence of car manufacturers delaying - if not stopping altogether - development and investment in innovative sustainable technology. Can the Commissioner please comment?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, I can but offer my sincere thanks for the broad support for this proposal from all sides of the House. What we have, of course, is a compromise, and there is always scope to want a little bit more in such cases. I can also say that I, personally, and the Commission would have been prepared to go a step further. What we have now is what we were able to achieve, however, and it represents a major step forward.
In particular, I would like to emphasise once again what Mrs Rühle said. Politically speaking, the crucial thing, especially in this situation, is to improve European vehicles in areas that will be crucial in future. One thing is quite clear, and that is that the crisis in demand is not just the result of the general economic conditions and the economic uncertainty but also has something to do with the fact that the vehicles that European manufacturers are offering have perhaps failed to meet the requirements of the European market in recent years where fuel consumption, environmental friendliness and safety are concerned. That is why it is so important that this is now quickly rectified.
I must say, however, and I think this is extremely important, that I did not feel pressurised by anyone, nor did I feel under political pressure. The only difficulty that there was in this legislative proposal - and I do not want to hide this, it was also discussed a little - was, of course, that of framing this ambitious legislation so that we would not be losing jobs in the European Union, but safeguarding them. This balance was not always easy to achieve on individual points, but I believe that, in the end, we did find a very sound middle ground solution that satisfies all the interests.
All the same, I have to say that, for all the processes that we have settled in trialogue over recent weeks or months, there was repeated criticism that things were moving too quickly. That is something that we could certainly discuss at the beginning of a parliamentary term and then stick to for that entire term, but there should be no criticism that processes are democratically unsound at the end of a term - the time when particular issues are being resolved - after three years of participation in such a process here in Parliament. I accept the criticism, but I think that this issue is something that would need to be resolved immediately after the elections for the entire parliamentary term.
It is also important for this proposal to be put back in the context of Mr Sacconi's proposal, which has been successfully passed. His proposal was about reducing the CO2 emissions from motor vehicles to 130 grams, with 10 grams to be envisaged for additional measures. One part of these additional measures has now been regulated. I cannot wait to see how we will take up the rest of these grams that have yet to be decided and what proposals the Commission will put forward for Parliament to decide upon.
I might add that, when it came to the issue of the transitional period, we had to find a middle path, from an economic point of view. We have not laid down the 30-month period conclusively, but instead, the Commission is to carry out another impact assessment for each individual type of tyre, on the basis of which we can then decide until when the deadline can run for each type. It is my belief that it makes the most sense economically to remove tyres lawfully produced in the European Union as quickly as possible from circulation, but only when the market really offers the proper potential to do that. I would like to close, therefore, by offering my sincere thanks, once again, to all those who were involved.
It is important for all of us to make Europe's roads safer and reduce the number of fatalities and serious injuries by introducing standard equipment. The ESP system must become accessible to everyone and no longer be an optional extra. Obviously, we must not forget either the impact on the environment which the new tyre pressure monitoring system will have, with its reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. This will also be accompanied by a reduction in noise and sound pollution in general. New technologies will enable us to have safer, greener cars.
Mr President, as I said earlier, I am in favour of this proposal, although I would like to point out that if amendments had not been tabled that go somewhat beyond what was adopted on the basis of a general compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this problem would not have arisen, since the compromise amendments were completely in keeping with the nature of this revision, namely a recast. If this had been the case, then we could have voted today, but we accept the deferral as it makes sense.
Mr President, I am sorry to prolong this discussion, but may I build on what was just said by my colleagues, Mrs Doyle and Mrs Frassoni? As one of the authors of several of the amendments, I was in contact with the President's office until 11.50 and could not obtain a clear 'yes' or 'no' as to whether the amendments we tabled - 136 to 139 - would be voted upon or not. It was unclear, and the last word was that the vote would probably be postponed. As Avril Doyle said, we simply cannot understand why these amendments are inadmissible. In the interests of clarity, we should have some more time and have clarification from the President's office.
Mr President, some of the amendments you ruled inadmissible were also ruled inadmissible by the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public health and Food Safety under the recast procedures. This Parliament has no right to introduce legislation. Its chance of influence is in amending legislation put before us. It seems that, in the way we have interpreted the recast procedures, we have castrated ourselves. Could you inform the President that if this Parliament is to demonstrate its true virility, we need to review these?
rapporteur. - Mr President, I have no objection to this oral amendment by Mr Swoboda, which refers to the original text. In any case, I was told by the Tabling Office that this amendment is valid only for the amended one. If that is not so, I am in favour of this oral amendment being part of the original. Therefore, those who are following my advice will vote against the first part in this fifth vote and then we shall have an extra vote, which is not on the voting list, on this oral amendment, which I support.
Although the texts being proposed by the Commission mark a step forward in the development of transport which respects and protects the environment, they can and must be improved. I do not think that Mr Jarzembowski's approach, where we only criticise without making any improvements, is the right one. In my personal opinion, a directive which cannot be applied to all Member States on a mandatory basis will not achieve its aim and may significantly distort the internal market through the barriers which some Member States, if they so wish, may introduce to block the free movement of persons and goods.
The costs incurred by traffic congestion are rising to 1% of GDP. We must therefore act to reduce this, but the cost of these measures must not only be paid by goods and passenger transport operators. Congestion is caused by all vehicles and, especially, by a defective infrastructure. Member States must invest in the construction of motorways, high-speed railway lines and in those alternatives which can cut traffic congestion. Intermodal transport will facilitate the transfer of goods from the road network to a rail, ship or air freight system, making the transportation of goods and passengers more efficient.
Mr President, I agree with Mr Jarzembowski when he says that mobility is essential to society. I also agree with Mrs Wortmann-Kool when she says that here, too, we must pay particular attention to the internal market. However, to my mind, this compromise does take us a step in that direction. The internal market is important, and so it is also important that agreements be made between Member States. In addition, this is just a first step towards a system we are going to have to think over in its entirety anyway at a given point in time and to adjust at certain points.
Thank you, Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank both rapporteurs, especially Mr El Khadraoui, for this difficult work on trying to reach a compromise. I think that part of the compromise is being voted on by the Committee on Transport and Tourism - the part relating to the use of earmarked taxes - but the plenary sitting will clearly be voting on a certain part, such as congestion. I would also like to thank my fellow Members for their understanding in relation to not removing time-based charges in countries at the European Union's borders, where heavy goods vehicles generate considerable pollution, queuing at the borders for long periods, day and night. Finally, once we have adopted this directive in one form or another, I very much hope that, regardless of the crisis, the Member States will nonetheless not subordinate the short-term situation to long-term goals. In my view, this would be very important in resolving the problem. Thank you.
The stricter exhaust emission standards for goods vehicles, for which we had had such high hopes, were inadequate. Any improvement in each individual goods vehicle meant nothing, as simultaneous growth cancelled everything out. That means that we need new, targeted measures in order to provide a better framework for a market that has come off the rails. It also means, however, that the likes of relief for heavy road-users, which are still in existence, need to be abolished, as what this does is give extra reward to polluters for polluting.
I should also like to take this opportunity to request support for my Amendment 76. I do not understand why the Commission decided to change the old text on regulatory charges to 'any urban road'. The imposition of such regulatory charges is a national competence. It is the Member States who must decide on the way they wish to impose such a regulatory charge, provided it is non-discriminatory, of course. I propose that we return to the old text from 2006, therefore, and I ask for your support for this.
There are a number of points that need to be made in this debate. Firstly, this is the start of a process, not the end, and contained within the compromise is the right of Member States to introduce congestion charging or not. I also want to remind honourable Members, particularly from the PPE-DE Group, that this Chamber has consistently demanded from the Commission a proposal and strategy to internalise external costs in all modes of transport - but in particular road transport - and this has indeed been highlighted as our roads become more congested and global warming more severe.
There is also a need to see a more balanced road sector that is not only economically sustainable, but also environmentally sustainable, and one that recognises that it has to pay a fair price for the costs it creates - be these environmental or infrastructure costs. We cannot have a 'do-nothing' attitude, although I note that this phrase has become synonymous with the Conservatives over recent months. I know the formulation of this report has been difficult - some Members believe it goes too far, whilst others not far enough. However, as a first stage, I think that this compromise deserves support. I look forward in the future to other externalities being included and would stress my group's support that all revenue from Eurovignettes should be earmarked for use in the transport sector so that transparency and public opinion can be brought closer together.
We should not forget the reason why this process has dragged on for so long. At least three factors are simultaneously at play. Until recently, road and other infrastructures were paid for only by taxpayers. The Eurovignette is paving the way to allow us to begin shifting at least part of the responsibility for paying the financial burden of infrastructures onto the user, in a manner that is clearly fairer. In other words the Eurovignette is an instrument designed to ensure fair taxation, despite all indications to the contrary at the moment. Ensuring this takes place in a different way will depend on financial engineering within the various states, who are not allowing Europe to deal with the matter - because otherwise we would be only too willing to do so. The present Eurovignette applies the 'user pays' principle. Now we have the problem of switching to a 'polluter pays' system, which is another great principle that we must seek to tackle.
The Commissioner said that mountain regions are opposing the Single Market. What about areas like my own constituency in the West of Ireland, from where 1 000 lorries depart every week? They are hit while going to the market. And what is this about it being a single market? It is not! Costs are being raised for peripheral countries because you want the greening of the market. You can't have it both ways, however. You must think about the countries on the periphery and give them a fair deal, Mr President, something which is not done in this report.
For us transport policy makers, it is a quantum leap forward that air pollution, noise and congestion can now also be included in the tolls. This reinforces the polluter pays principle. The polluter pays principle prevents profits going into private hands while the damage is paid for by society. That is a social democratic concept. Parliament has resolved to introduce this principle to all modes of transport step by step. There will then, at long last, be fair competition between the railways, lorries and inland waterways.
It must also be made clear at this point that it will be entirely up to the Member States whether or not these additional tolls are implemented. Nobody will be forced to do so. All we are doing here is setting up the basic framework for it so that there is no patchwork of different toll models across Europe, thereby avoiding discrimination, as road haulage should be treated in a comparable way throughout the internal market. For us, this is not about additional income streams but is, instead, about directing transport more strongly by means of price signals. The Committee on Transport and Tourism is right to want to see the mandatory ring-fencing of this additional income for use in reducing external damage.
We must remember that road hauliers are not, in the main, vast enterprises, but small businesses with a handful of vehicles. Let us not make them pay for the upkeep of the country. This is already being done through tax on fuel, insurance, road checks and through many other charges. Introducing payments for external costs would significantly increase the cost of transport and mean paying twice for the same thing. It is clear that goods need to be transported, as there will always be producers and customers for goods which will need transporting, but do we have to make them responsible for the costs of infrastructure? I move for the suspension of all further action until better times, or for the complete rejection of the Commission's proposal.
The EU has had a mandatory rail toll since the mid-1990s. It applies to every locomotive on every kilometre of track, and it is practically unlimited in size. On the roads, it is left up to the Member States to decide whether they charge any toll at all. It applies only to goods vehicles, only on motorways and only to goods vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more. That is unfair competition. It leads to the traffic moving from the railways to the roads rather than, as your fine grandiose speeches often indicate, from the roads to the railways.
The rail toll in Slovakia is twice as high as in Germany, and the Slovaks have no road tolls at all. That is just madness. That is why we need this directive. We need the true reflection of costs. If Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believe that the costs of congestion should not be included, they should at least vote for the inclusion of the climate costs, the accident costs and the noise costs. Then they will be credible.
We know that measures aiming to combat pollution or stimulate technological innovation, such as cleaner engines and intelligent vehicles, are essential. The problem, which is starting to cause serious difficulties, lies in the imposition of a congestion charge. As far as the so-called 'peak hours' are concerned, the cause of these is, above all, local motorists who are travelling to their job or business, or for leisure. By coming up with the imposition of a charge that affects the carriage of goods, we will simply be punishing those who supply the workings of our daily lives, and who do so in the fastest, most flexible way, door-to-door.
We will also be acting unilaterally if we fail, for example, to take action in terms of changing working hours, accident prevention or road planning and maintenance, and will therefore call into question the very mobility that defines our societies and the market economy. We are also impugning other measures taken to promote the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union. For my country, Portugal, as well as for all the peripheral countries, this measure is nothing more than a throttling of economic activity, as we will merely be net contributors of any transit charges.
In addition, we are in the grips of a cruel financial, economic and social crisis, which has had devastating effects on goods transport. It therefore sounds like a bad joke to propose a measure now that necessarily means raising the cost of goods, especially those transported in the countries on the fringes of Europe, which are precisely the ones that are worst affected by unemployment and lack the alternatives of railways or motorways of the sea. They simply do not exist and, moreover, there is no willingness at the border.
If we do not include CO2 in the Eurovignette, what other options do we have? Precious few, because pigs will fly, as we say, before Ecofin ministers agree on EU-level fuel taxation. Worse still, if a Member State wants to bring in a toll system that reflects the external costs of CO2, they will not be allowed to do so unless we now include CO2 within the Eurovignette. Excluding CO2 from the Eurovignette would be particularly unfair given that all Member States now have binding CO2 reduction targets to meet under the effort-sharing decision. They need to have a range of tools at their disposal.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity - as soon as we have quiet again in the Chamber - to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur. It was a tough job, and yet noteworthy progress was made, and progress that represents a small step on the road to the complete greening of heavy goods transport, especially in allowing no compensation for the additional charges and in including noise, air pollution and, to some extent, congestion, with some room for discussion about whether - in particular in the case of congestion - this is not somewhat too little.
I am, however, dissatisfied with certain elements and I would like to say a few words in that regard. The problem of climate change must, by now, be something that everyone knows about or is at least aware of. We have therefore also decided on special requirements, especially for heavy industry, that are not particularly easy to comply with and that are very much open to further discussion. However, what no one in Austria and in the rest of Europe understands, under these circumstances, is that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has prevented one of the largest causes of CO2 emissions, namely heavy goods transit traffic, from having to pay even a single euro cent for the costs it has given rise to. That is something you will not be able to explain to your constituents, ladies and gentlemen. They have to pay these costs through their taxes, and you really cannot explain that.
(BG) The report on road tolls contains suggestions which will make transport in the European Union significantly more expensive, especially over long distances and when using carriers from periphery countries of the EU, like Bulgaria. It will not only be the carriers which will suffer as a result of this, but also their direct customers, retailers and end customers in the European Union. Road transport operators are being hit hard by the financial and economic crisis. We are seeing a 50% reduction in the demand for transport services compared to 2007, as well as 110% more bankruptcies in this sector compared to 2007.
Due to the lack of similar regulatory requirements, European carriers are not as competitive as firms from third countries which carry out a large number of shipments in the European Union. Companies which have invested in green vehicles in recent years are in a particularly difficult position. At the moment, they cannot service their leases and are consequently faced with bankruptcy. Taking into account these conditions, I firmly support proposals 71 and 72 which recommend a 'congestion' factor should not be included in the directive. I also think that it is extremely important not to allow resources collected from road tolls to be transferred to other means of transport. This will have an adverse impact, especially in countries with an underdeveloped road infrastructure, as is the case in my country, Bulgaria.
On this side of the House, we attach great importance to air quality, about which we are all very concerned, and we all know that lorries pollute. As Mrs Lichtenberger put it, 'there is documented evidence'. Now Mrs Wortmann-Kool, who has left, spoke about the obstacles to the internal market and Mr Jarzembowski, despite his report on the greening of transport, also expressed reservations about the Eurovignette. I would say to both of them that the biggest threat to all markets will be if we get overtaken by pollution. I do not believe that an extra 2-3% will be a huge burden, but it will show that we are taking serious steps to counter pollution.
The proposal under discussion will allow Member States to levy charges with the objective of covering certain external environmental costs, as well as generating a significant income to be used for improving the European road network and minimising the environmental impact of some road transport. On the other hand, it could also mean significant costs, especially for the more peripheral countries such as my country, Portugal. That is why I insisted on Copel and vehemently opposed the mandatory extension of the geographic scope to cover all major roads.
I also opposed the application of charges generated just by the congestion of a few, which is a measure that will lead to unfair advantage and which fails to penalise those who pollute most. I do, however, recognise the need to keep accounts of these charges. Application just to trans-European road networks or to routes usually and significantly used by international road haulage, thereby allowing the Member State to choose the routes for which to introduce charges, is a lesser evil which could be minimised even further if application of this proposal were postponed until after the difficult global economic crisis we are currently experiencing.
This debate has also shown up the tensions between the peripheral regions and those areas in the centre of our continent. Quite simply, it must also be the case that when people from the peripheral regions drive though our central areas, they must take account of the concerns of the population. That is very important and I do ask for understanding on this point, because on this issue some of the population has found itself pushed to the limit. The subsidiarity principle, as expressed in the proposal, allows the Member States to decide for themselves whether they want to internalise these external costs.
For the central areas - and for the Alpine regions in particular - it is clear that they will choose to do so. If peripheral regions decide not to take that route, that is something I can understand. Overall, however, we must strive to make the individual sectors in the transport industry bear the costs that they actually give rise to. That is the only way in which, in the long term, we can create a system that is truly sustainable and that satisfies the concerns of the population. Thank you.
Moreover, when it landed in the office of our co-legislator, it had quite a different nature, because oil was at USD 57 a barrel. It is therefore a text that was born under difficult circumstances, but I would like to say at this point, because I have been surprised by some of the things I have heard, that it is not a text that introduces a tax or a toll: it is the individual Member States that will decide whether to introduce a tax or a toll.
We do, in my view, need to be quite clear on this. The text complies completely with the principle of subsidiarity, and it is also fair. I would say that I am very pleased with it on behalf of my own country because it will make it possible to obtain a contribution to the infrastructure of a transit country such as France from heavy goods transporters that currently go through the country without buying a drop of petrol and without spending a cent. I therefore think that this will be a beneficial text.
The internalisation of external transport costs is, in the long run, a measure which may help to make transport greener. I should mention that specific legislative instruments such as these are actually necessary in Member States such as Romania. However, I do not envisage yet that these external costs will be applied in the future, at any rate, not in Bucharest where I come from. I am referring here to traffic congestion, air pollution, sound pollution, water pollution, soil pollution or the impact on natural landscapes. I find it difficult to believe that the authorities in Romania will implement this directive, which is more of a burden than a help.
I do not believe that the Commission set out to inflict an additional tax or wanted to penalise countries situated to the west and east, in other words, more outlying countries. In any case, the Eurovignette is not compulsory. We also tried to harmonise the system to establish a framework that prevents tariff fraud, so maximum values are also established. However, different stances, different ideas naturally emerged in our discussion. I believe that the text that will be sent to the Council will certainly undergo amendments because people do not see eye to eye within the Council either. We all agree with the 'polluter pays' principle, but then when we go into the practical applications, differences emerge between Member States, between political forces, between MEPs, between the Commission, Parliament and Council. The argument is therefore certainly thorny and complicated.
I do not, however, think we need to give credence to the critical viewpoint that takes a gloomy outlook because we are in the midst of a crisis. It is true to say that we are in the midst of a crisis but it is also true that the proposal is for the measure to be applied from 2012. I certainly hope - and I am absolutely sure I am right to say - that the crisis will be well and truly over by 2012. A little optimism is a good thing, but even the most pessimistic amongst us cannot believe that we will still be in the midst of a crisis in the year 2012.
Mr President, I wish to make a couple of comments. I should like to start by asking my fellow Members not to be fooled by the off-putting statistics some have put forward. One example is Mrs Wortmann-Kool, who talks of additional costs of several euro. With all due respect, that is completely wrong. I can tell you to the nearest cent what the impact would be in the most extreme case: congestion would be 65 euro cents per kilometre at the absolute maximum: 65 euro cents in very heavily congested areas, and only for the few kilometres where there was congestion, not the rest of the journey.
Thirdly, I note that quite a few of my fellow Members are seeking to anticipate all the Council's decisions, as the Council has yet to take a position. We should not be deterred by this one bit. Let us simply go for a position we support 100%. Afterwards, we shall enter the debate, the fray, with the Council. I can assure you that I shall do my best as rapporteur to secure most, if not all, of Parliament's position, which we shall then discuss at a later date.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, as we close this debate, to add two comments. The first I address to Mr Evans. My group is in favour of the internalisation of external costs, and specifically exhaust emissions and noise. We believe this is reasonable. Yet, if you always put the polluter pays principle first - I am prepared to discuss this with you - then it is the Member States that cause the congestion by not providing sufficient infrastructure. The goods vehicles drive into congestion, 80% of which is made up of cars. To make businesses pay for congestion caused by the Member States is nonsensical. If you applied the polluter pays principle, Member States would have to give extra money to the goods vehicle owners as it is the States that cause the congestion by failing to provide adequate infrastructure in time.
Mr Vice-President, you were right to say that you did not want to introduce new taxes by means of this proposal and you insisted on ring-fencing. Can we agree, then, Commissioner, Mr Vice-President, that, when the Council of Ministers fails to come out in favour of a clear ring-fencing of the revenue from the Eurovignettes, you will withdraw the proposal? You see, you said you do not want any new taxes. I completely agree with you that if the Eurovignette is to be made more expensive as a result of exhaust emissions and noise, this extra money must also be used to reduce the environmental impact of road transport and not to fill holes in the finance ministers' budgets. That is not on. With that in mind, I hope that you will stick to your position, in other words, no taxation without ring-fencing and withdrawal of the proposal where that is the case. Thank you very much.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the opportunity, a few days after International Women's Day on 8 March, to make a declaration before the European Parliament on childcare facilities for pre-school age children. These facilities are essential for promoting gender equality and for helping to achieve a work-life balance, but also for ensuring quality of life for children. At a meeting of the European Council in Barcelona in 2002, the Member States adopted ambitious aims which were to be fulfilled by 2010. In line with the undertaking which the Commission accepted before the European Parliament in 2007, a report on the implementation of the Barcelona objectives was presented in October 2008. In the report, the Commission spoke about why it is important to invest more in childcare facilities.
The Commission noted mainly that the Barcelona objectives are aimed at eliminating obstacles to accessing the labour market, especially for women. More than 6 million women in the EU (aged from 25 to 49) say that they are unable to work or can work only part-time because of family obligations. The European economy is thereby deprived of significant productive potential, and this at a time when it must confront serious economic and demographic challenges, and when the social position of families is thereby weakened. The development of childcare facilities for pre-school age children will enable families to decide freely how to organise their time and how to achieve a better work-life balance. The aim is not to 'force' parents to send their children to these facilities. The aim is to offer this option to parents who want it. The development of childcare services will also contribute to the prevention of poverty, especially for single-parent families, more than a third of whom face the threat of poverty.
In connection with the demographic slowdown which Europe is going through, access to childcare facilities will also assist in the implementation of family planning. It turns out that the Member States with the highest birth rates are precisely those which have introduced the most highly-developed policies on the work-life balance and which record the highest levels of employment of women. Childcare facilities also contribute to children's development, of course. Numerous studies, especially those carried out by the OECD and UNICEF, have shown that these services play a significant role in the personal development of children, provided that they are of a high quality and children are entrusted to them for adequate periods of time. Childcare services can also have a positive influence on educational results and future professional life.
The Commission states in its report that despite all of the aforementioned good reasons, most Member States are far from achieving the objectives set out in 2002. A lot of work remains to be done, especially concerning children under three years old. Furthermore, there are some facilities operating only for part of the working day, which restricts parents' access to the labour market. The Commission recognises, however, that significant progress has been achieved in many Member States. The undertakings adopted by Member States at a European level and the appeals expressed by the European Parliament in a series of resolutions have played an important role in this regard. It is therefore necessary for all of the participants, especially the national and regional bodies, to come together and create progressive, financially accessible and high-quality childcare facilities for pre-school age children.
In the Plan for Achieving Gender Equality, the European Commission undertook to support the efforts being made by Member States in this area. It encourages the Member States to make full use of the possibilities offered by the structural funds. With the aim of assisting local organisations to introduce measures in this area, the Commission has adopted an information brochure in addition to last year's one on the possibilities for financing family support measures. The Commission will continue to support the exchange of proven approaches and will regularly monitor the Barcelona objectives within the framework of the strategy for growth and employment. It will also evaluate family policies, especially policies on the work-life balance, in which it will rely mainly on cooperation with the OECD. Last but not least, the Commission will support adherence to European childcare objectives within the framework of the strategy for growth and employment after 2010.
I was curious though that there was no reference - unless I missed it - to the Council Presidency comments of a month or so ago, because I thought those remarks were also very helpful to the debate and they made the point very clearly that, whilst the Barcelona objectives had not yet been reached - in some cases, by a very long way - it was very clear that a number of countries did not have any immediate plans to reach them and did not see that as a particular problem. The reason for that is, and I quote from what the Czech Council Presidency said: 'No one should criticise the decision of those countries that fail to fulfil the Barcelona objectives and do not intend to increase efforts for their fulfilment. There are countries whose citizens, based on their historical experience, are not interested in placing their children in day care'.
It is a trompe l'oeil figure, which shows that, actually, men are hit first - and most - by unemployment due to the male domination in industry, such as the car industry. However, women will be hit in the second wave of the redundancies and we will suffer in the long term. Women with temporary and outsourcing contracts often fill posts in sectors where the need is great during good economic times but where the position is often very fragile during an economic downturn. This flexibility works in favour of the labour market but not for women who want and need social security, employment guarantees and reconciliation of private and professional life. It is even more worrying when conservative governments, such as the current Czech Presidency, talk about revising the Barcelona targets and going back to home childcare. The Barcelona targets, as PSE women demonstrated by our campaign in 2007, are beneficial for the whole of society and all children. It helps to give them an equal start in life and to eradicate poverty.
In the parliamentary working group on Quality of childhood, we observed that our children live in a very complicated world. The future for those who are children right here, right now - today - is completely uncertain. A child of today can climb right to the top of the social ladder or fall right down to the bottom. Such children can remain in their own cultural circle or they can search out another one. They can follow a similar life path to their parents or do the exact opposite. They can marry someone from the opposite sex or someone of their own sex. More than 50 years ago, when we launched the project of uniting Europe, all that was completely different.
These matters are more pertinent than ever now that we are faced with problems raised by the economic crisis. In the European Union, more than six million women aged 25 to 49 state that they are forced to be unemployed or work part time due to their family responsibilities. The situation of more than one quarter of these women stems from the lack of childcare facilities or their excessive cost. Six years after the adoption of the Barcelona objectives, as the 2010 deadline approaches, we find that most Member States will not achieve these objectives, which were not even particularly ambitious: guaranteeing access to childcare facilities for 30% of children under the age of three. We must therefore work hard to achieve satisfactory levels of availability of children's services, beginning with services for children aged under three.
However, I am now concerned that these targets will not be achieved and, of course, I am concerned about the indications from the Czech Presidency about replacing the childcare objective with care in the home as a fully viable alternative, and that it therefore wishes to remove this objective. However, I would also like to thank Commissioner Špidla, who has, in fact, made it clear that the Commission still regards it as important for us to achieve the Barcelona objectives with regard to childcare. I would also like to thank Mrs Resetarits for her proposal on child mainstreaming. I think that, together, we should bear this in mind.
Of course, life is not like that and mothers often work outside the home. They may want to work, or choose to, and even if they do not, they may need to earn because mortgages must be paid and food must be put on the table. Women have been a wonderful addition to the workforce. Their inclusion and equal treatment is a matter of fundamental rights. However, babies do not know, nor are they able to consider what their mothers must, or want to, do. They are hardwired to need what they need. Nature is a very powerful force.
There are always consequences when we go against nature. Having a loving invested mother is the ideal for a child, which we should make every effort to accommodate where a woman wants to be available to her child in those early years. This is because, if that young child needs the constant reassuring presence of its mother, not having her will have an impact, despite all the very worthy reasons for her absence. However, as I said, women work, and we must do our best to at least ensure that if someone other than the primary care-giver is taking care of the child below the age of two years nine months, that it is someone who can give the child as nurturing a care as possible.
Children are our future. The foundation they receive is of utmost importance, but the time, space and nurturing children need to grow and develop fully is becoming a luxury afforded to fewer and fewer. For better or for worse, we are shaping Europe's future by how we raise our children. I would ask the Commission to view this issue for a moment from a child's point of view. If you could ask a baby whether it wanted its mum or a day-care centre, it would always choose mum. We need to listen to that child as mothers do, and to help them find a way to reconcile home and work to the benefit of both.
Many of the countries with a high proportion of women on the labour market, such as the northern countries, have, at the same time, higher birth rates and fertility levels. It is necessary for the state to provide support so that women can work and, at the same time, fulfil their longing to be mothers. The demographic situation is simply an outcome of the interest or lack of interest shown by the state in the next generation. By supporting family policies, the state will provide the essential preconditions for families. The blindness to these values which we have seen to date, together with support for the consumer lifestyle, is probably the cause of the current demographic gloom.
I would remind you that family responsibilities prevent more than six million European women from taking part in the labour market. Yet there are 15 Member States that have a coverage ratio lower than the European average, which falls far short of the Barcelona objectives. For example, the Czech Republic, which currently holds the presidency of the European Council, has a coverage ratio lower than 10% for the under three age group. It is not surprising, then, that there should be a debate on the revision of the Barcelona objectives included in the programme of the Czech Presidency. More seriously, the Czech Presidency will, and I quote: 'focus on the issue of parental childcare and its relation to employment policy and stress the importance of home childcare as a fully fledged alternative to a professional career'. End quote.
Thus, parents will also find the best solution and will adapt care facilities over time, immediately after the birth and three years later. However, we must look at the services being supplied, because quality costs money. Today, in most countries, quality costs a great deal of money and implies private facilities. By contrast, public facilities, which are cheaper or - on rare occasions - free, have lower costs but are of a poor standard. We therefore have to look at the education of the staff working in such facilities and we need to increase parents' confidence so that they can participate. When I had the first of my nine children in Paris, I was confident of the standard of services offered by these facilities, which I as a mother could not give.
The policies which encourage labour mobility, considered to be an efficiency factor, cannot continue to ignore the fact that people have children. Many of them live in poor families without any proper provision for food, healthcare and education. Sometimes, the family environment is violent. When parents emigrate for work, these children are also left alone. These services can break the poverty chain and offer a positive alternative way of socialisation under the guidance of specialist staff. However, to be able to fulfil this role, crèches and nurseries need to be:
At this point, a fundamental question arises which will determine the direction of further deliberations. It is the question of which social model we wish to promote. Do we want to have families that are adapted to the market and the needs of companies or a market and companies that are adapted to families? This is absolutely not a meaningless question. European and national policies in this area are both determined by the tension between market logic and the logic of human nature. The task of society is therefore to act in such a way that women and men can decide freely between the two logical options, each of which has a reason for existing when viewed from a broader perspective than that of work.
(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, childcare should be the focus of EU policy. Not because we sometimes say for the sake of it that children are the future of the nation, but because current reality demands us to think about and work at building the future of Europe. We are witnessing a serious demographic crisis, a low birth rate, an ageing population, as well as economic and social problems in society. Our efforts must be aimed at creating suitable conditions for giving birth to, bringing up, educating, providing materially for and fostering the social development of children. We need to appropriately allocate the rights, obligations and responsibilities involving childcare between the state, local authorities and the family. We also need to support childcare institutions in both the public and private sector, look to establish public-private partnerships in the area of childcare and obtain the funds for their development. To enable us to attain the Barcelona objectives, we must adopt concrete measures, increase the provision for children in crèches and nurseries, which must be built as a priority. We must also set up networks offering comprehensive services, consultancy and social support for children and parents.
My country, Bulgaria, offers a high level of childcare. The National Strategy for Children and National Child Protection Programme which have been adopted not only specified the objectives, but also concrete measures to be implemented by the executive with regard to childcare. Children's institutions changed their image, for instance, solutions have been sought aimed at returning children to their family environment, the principles of foster families were accepted, safe houses were created and nurseries and crèches were built. However, we are talking about all this in the context of a financial and economic crisis, when it is possible that we will lose what we have achieved and fail to achieve what we have planned. Will we then invest in the children of Europe?
(CS) Commissioner, ladies, you will perhaps not like what I have to say. The Barcelona objectives have the aim of increasing employment among mothers but they say nothing at all about improving the lives of their children nor do they have the aim of helping these children to manage and overcome life's problems in the future. Someone raised the point that, for example, infants and toddlers up to two years old need the presence of their mother, father or grandmother or simply a nanny every day, but the one thing these children definitely do not need for their healthy development is a childcare facility. The situation is quite different for children of pre-school age, of course, and here the Barcelona objectives are quite appropriate. Even the Czech Republic manages to provide childcare facilities for 90% of pre-school age children because these children are learning to play together and need to be in a group. However, ladies and gentlemen, the Barcelona objectives are a policy of the last century. A modern family policy for the 21st century should also promote the healthy development of children. Those of us from the communist countries have a wealth of experience with childcare facilities because mothers had to go back to work four or five months after their child was born. I would like to ask you to read a bit of European history as well.
I would also, however, like to emphasise one more thing: child day care is generally spoken of in the context of gender equality and women's employment, but I would like to emphasise that this is not merely a care service, but also an educational service, and this base education creates a basis for success at school and later in life. In this context, we also consider it particularly important, and definitely not an attitude from the past century, as we have just heard. It is an approach for this century.
(PL) Madam President, nurseries are an evil. They may be a necessary evil, but they are an evil. I shall never forget how I had to take my three month old little brother to the nursery because my mother had to go to work early. He kept on holding on to me because he didn't want to be picked up. I believe that if we ask ourselves whether the good of the child or the parents' careers are more important, the good of the child should always come first.
Kindergartens and nurseries are necessary, but only where there is a real need for them. But what is needed above all is to be sensitive to, to give a chance to, to help, those parents, particularly mothers, who want to stay at home with their little children so that they can care for them. They need both financial support and advice. That is something we must remember. When we speak of childcare, we are talking about children and what they need, and not about what we want for our own personal convenience.
There is, however, one unchanging constant in all this, and that is the individual psychological needs of children. In this area, there is no progress or revolutionary change. Ensuring that these children grow into mature citizens requires the efforts of ordinary women and ordinary men, without ideology, without pretensions, without quasi-modern methods, but just with natural care, time and dedication, even if it does involve occasionally putting oneself and one's own ambitions on hold for a while. This is for the good of the children, and therefore also for the happiness of the parents, and effectively for the development of the normal European society in which I would like to live.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I asked for the floor in order to disagree with Mrs Estrela. It was in fact her caricaturing of the Czech Presidency's intentions that motivated me to speak. Nobody wants to send women into the home. The problem is that there are women who want or would like to stay at home. There are even organisations that seek to defend them! These are women who are ignored, disregarded and discriminated against because they want to dedicate themselves to their families, and we are not listening to them. Moreover, this is a question of freedom: it is a question of the freedom of choice that the Left likes to evoke so much, but is forgetting here. It is about whether or not to respect couples' choices about how to organise themselves. It is about being able to provide a better quality of life and more quality care from fathers and from mothers to those who want to do it that way. It is that which our society also needs to do. We will not move forward or solve the problems with the birth rate and people's happiness through prejudice. They will be solved through policies that are adjusted to reality and to the spontaneous desires of people. We will not move forward through an obsession with the state and with the market. Let us move forward with a fair view of the family!
Member of Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for what was, in my opinion, an exceptionally important and profound debate. It is, of course, clear that both the family and childhood are going through a series of changes in the current historical period. For example, in the middle ages, childhood was not recognised as a phase and children were seen as small adults and it can be said that the concept of childhood essentially developed in the Enlightenment, the period of Jean Jacques Rousseau and his novel Emil. From this perspective, it is always necessary to take account of the fact that families depend on society and society of course depends on the family. The Barcelona criteria are definitely not a policy of the last century, they are a policy which attracts lively discussion and which will surely continue to attract discussion. Despite all this, both the current debate and the informal negotiations of labour and social affairs ministers have echoed the view that the Barcelona criteria are relevant for the current period and that it is right to continue with them. I would also like to stress that the Barcelona criteria do not involve forcing a single solution on anyone but providing a real choice, a real choice for parents because, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental point has been made in the debate and in my opinion very clearly in the last contribution, that genuinely attentive and loving parents naturally have a great ability to distinguish how to decide at a given moment, in a given phase of family life, or in a given situation, what will be best for their children. And therefore I believe it is also good to provide choice through the Barcelona criteria.
Concerning the question of how the Commission will support the Barcelona criteria, it can be done through the structural funds. In the new perspective, it is explicitly possible for the first time. Previously, it was technically possible but the way was rather unclear and complicated, since this is an open possibility. Of course, the Commission is also following the development of the Barcelona criteria, in the same way that it can assist in imparting good practice and good approaches to facilitate solutions for individual Member States. Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that the Barcelona criteria do not, in any way, conflict with children's interests and I would like to emphasise what was been said by many people, that the Barcelona criteria represent a specific approach to the matter from a quantitative standpoint but that we must not, under any circumstances, neglect the qualitative aspect. In the same way it is clear that the main decisions must always rest with the parents of course and I have to say that personally, at the end of the day and on the basis of my own simple family experience, I have faith in parents.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, companies and workers are both beginning to feel the effects of the financial and economic crisis. Although circumstances vary between individual Member States, the employment situation in Europe is generally deteriorating. In 2009, overall employment may go down by 1.6%, which represents the loss of 3.5 million jobs. The level of unemployment in the EU could be around 10% in 2010. Day after day, companies are announcing restructuring measures or are relocating, often with the loss of many jobs. The situation in the company Qimonda, which has announced the closure of plants in Germany and Portugal, is, unfortunately, not unique.
The Commission would like to raise several points in connection with this situation. It is essential, above all, to anticipate and manage restructuring better through intensive dialogue with representatives of employees and the other parties involved. I think that the recently passed directive or amended directive on company councils constitutes one of the EU's major contributions in this matter. It is all the more important in this context that the companies affected are careful to abide by their obligations arising from EU directives relating to informing employees and consulting with them. The Commission also invites companies to introduce measures aimed at maintaining maximum levels of workers in employment through flexible work arrangements and the use of temporary layoffs for economic reasons.
The Commission has strengthened financial instruments at a European level with the aim of helping the Member States to overcome the crisis and its social consequences. The European Social Fund, which provides assistance to 9 million workers every year, has been simplified so that advance payments can be released for projects amounting to EUR 1.8 billion. I hope that the European Parliament and the Council will come to a rapid agreement over this matter. The Commission also supports those Member States which would like to reprogram the European Social Fund. Member States can also request intervention from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist workers who have been laid off. In the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Commission has proposed extending the eligibility criteria in order to respond better to the current economic crisis. I hope that here, too, Parliament will reach an early compromise with the Council. The Commission is prepared to work together with the German or Portuguese authorities to assess all requests for support from European funds. The Commission also supports social dialogue at a European level, as the social partners have a decisive role to play in managing the crisis. The European social partners are also due to submit a joint contribution on how to overcome the crisis at the tripartite meeting on 19 March.
It is important for the Commission that action is taken on a unified basis, because in that way it will be possible to combat the short-term effects of the crisis and to work towards future economic renewal. The Commission had this aim in mind when it introduced the European initiative to support employment within the framework of the European Economic Recovery Plan. On 4 March, the Commission also received a contribution designated for the meeting of the European Council on 19 and 20 March, which concentrates, among other things, on the requirement and the methods for supporting workers affected by the crisis and vulnerable persons on the labour market.
The Commission also welcomes the initiative of the Czech Presidency to organise a summit devoted to employment and social affairs in May 2009. The aim of this meeting will be to assess the situation and set out concrete measures. It should lead to the adoption of a common approach for reducing the social impact of the crisis, reaching a new consensus with the social partners and other participants over the question of modernising social policies and setting out concrete measures for speeding up economic recovery and overcoming the crisis through resolving structural shortcomings on the labour market.
I know that whether or not Qimonda continues to operate depends, above all, on market forces and the will of the shareholders. Nonetheless, it will also not be difficult to recognise that, as Qimonda is considered one of Portugal's main exporters and as it is also an essential part of the conversion of the economic fabric of the region, we cannot accept that only market forces should decide its future on their own. This circumstance explains why the authorities in Portugal and Germany have been tackling the issue at the highest level, specifically and very recently through the President of the Portuguese Republic and Chancellor Merkel. It is also because of this, Mr Špidla, that if the Portuguese Government has not yet invited you to visit the region, which is facing a real social emergency, I myself am inviting you, Commissioner, as I want you to see for yourself the seriousness of the situation, support the efforts that are being made and mobilise all the instruments that the Commission has at its disposal to prevent the lack of confidence throughout the region from spreading even further.
Qimonda is a paradigm case in the current context of global financial and economic crisis. It is a company that uses cutting-edge technology, employs highly qualified workers and promotes research. Qimonda meets the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. The Portuguese Government has been doing everything to find a solution that makes this company viable, but the solution is also dependent on the involvement of the German Federal Government and the state governments of Bavaria and Saxony. The Portuguese Government has already decided to make EUR 100 million available for this purpose. As I said, it has been doing and will continue to do everything it can, as was, in fact, recognised by Qimonda's German workers during the recent official visit by the President of the Portuguese Republic.
The European Commission and the Member States have been taking steps - and rightly so - to save many banks and to support certain industries such as, for example, the automotive industry. Why not also support Qimonda? Leaving Qimonda to its fate will have extremely serious consequences. Not only will thousands of workers in Germany and Portugal lose their jobs, but invaluable European intellectual property and a lot of Community funds that were invested in Qimonda will also be lost. Keeping Qimonda going in Germany and in Portugal is of such strategic importance for Europe that European Union support is well justified.
Nonetheless, that could mean that not all the jobs are retained. The Commissioner was right. This is where the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund comes in. In Qimonda, however, what we have is highly qualified workers who, through really well-chosen and specifically tailored re-training, could find new jobs in new sunrise industries. Those workers who have made the switch to the solar power industry have shown that. The Qimonda case shows that it is also up to the Commission to ensure that re-training takes place for jobs with a future rather than just taking a scatter-gun approach. Only targeted investment, environmental restructuring of the economy and then a corresponding re-training of the workforce give people hope and real prospects for the future.
For me, there are two aspects that I would like to introduce to this debate. First of all, Qimonda is capable of ensuring a crucial technological advance for the European Union in terms of semiconductor technology and nanotechnology. Secondly, Qimonda has no competitors in Europe but does have some in Asia, where they are assisted by 70% subsidies - that makes the crucial difference. Thirdly, the closing down of production at Qimonda will mean the loss of the cooperative core of a network of around 40 000 jobs in a region like Saxony alone.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this important debate that we are having it is essential that it be understood what is at stake, namely: the future of the strategic nanotechnology industry, together with research and development in a sector that is fundamental to the future of the information society, the central core and research centre of which is in Qimonda's complex in Germany, with its semiconductor factory in Portugal. The European Union cannot continue to allow its industries to be destroyed, particularly in a strategic area, and become dependent on the United States and the countries of Asia, which support their industries. It is regrettable that Mr Špidla has demonstrated in this House serious insensitivity to the issue of Qimonda as a productive company.
There are many jobs involved in this process: almost 2 000 at Vila do Conde, 5 000 in Germany, more than 5 000 worldwide, as well as thousands of jobs that would be indirectly affected in supplier companies and in the research and development centres of Qimonda's other partners. There is an enormous amount of research threatened by the risk of closure of Qimonda in Germany and the knock-on effects that such a situation would have in Portugal. It is out of the question that the European Union should not commit itself to this issue, at least on the same terms as it did with the banking sector. It must be kept in mind that Vila do Conde is in the north of Portugal where unemployment has grown most, whether because companies in the textiles and clothing industry have closed down or because multinationals which manufactured footwear and cabling, amongst other things, have relocated. It is now an area at high social risk if steps are not taken to slow the growth of unemployment and to guarantee production.
The demise or offshoring of these companies is often a function of globalising forces. Globalisation - normally a positive force that increases global welfare - can, unfortunately, wreak huge havoc on regional economies when large companies move location. This has happened in my own area in Ireland South, where Dell has announced layoffs of 1 900 of its staff at its factory in Limerick. Likewise, in Waterford, where Waterford Wedgwood may be closing in the not too distant future, and again, between that and downstream jobs, another thousand jobs may be lost.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, we have been talking about the Lisbon Strategy for years and these are perhaps not the most appropriate times to be discussing it. Nonetheless, without doubt we need a strategy: a strategy that responds to the difficulties and challenges posed by the present crisis. That is also what we expect from the Commission. It is essential that the Commission not shy away from this subject but instead find the capacity to develop joint actions with the government of Portugal and the governments of Germany and the German Länder. It is essential to keep in mind that this is an industry, as has already been said, that is important to Europe because of its quality and value, because of the research that it undertakes and because of the environmental quality that is associated with it. It is essential that the Commission not shy away. I second the invite issued by my colleague, Mr Peneda, for Mr Špidla and the Commission to visit Portugal.
Ladies and gentlemen, the case we are debating is significant and forms part of the overall economic situation. You will also be well aware that the strategy which the Commission is developing is a definite policy for industry because the Commission firmly believes that industry must always make up a substantial part of our economy and that it is the torch-bearer of high technology. It is clear that the crisis in which we find ourselves has structural elements and therefore the Commission, in its strategies and basic documents, is formulating, on the one hand, the future green economy or 'green jobs', while also pressing very hard for innovation and modernisation. It is also clear, as I stated at the beginning, that it is up to companies to take business decisions and that the Commission will not interfere in such affairs.
The other thing of course is that if a certain amount of restructuring takes place, certain decisions with social and community-wide consequences, there are instruments and European policies, which we, of course, always have a duty to mobilise and we are mobilising them. As for the call made twice for me to familiarise myself with the situation on the ground, I am, of course, ready to do that because, at the end of the day, it is one of our normal and fundamental duties to make decisions on the basis of what is possible. There has been mention of possibilities within the framework of European funds and mention of approaches discussed between the Portuguese Government and the German Government. In any event, I can state loud and clear that the Commission always makes active use of all available options, that it is doing so in this case, and that it will undoubtedly do so in future cases.
Two of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mr Romeva i Rueda, were in Marrakesh and will be talking about this during the debate. For my part, I would like to remind you that our committee attaches great importance to this matter, which brings into play the main aspects of the common fisheries policy: resource management, fleet management, respect for international, regional and bilateral agreements, technical measures and, above all, monitoring, to which I will return shortly. This defining issue is thus, in our view, a test of the credibility of the common fisheries policy.
The main measures introduced in the new recovery plan are a substantial reduction in the TAC from 27 500 to 22 000 tonnes in 2009 and further reductions to 19 950 tonnes for 2010 and 18 500 tonnes in 2011. The EC quota for 2009 is thus reduced to 12 406 tonnes from the 15 641 tonnes foreseen in the 2006 plan. The fishing seasons for all years are reduced, in particular, for purse seiners, which account for the bulk of this fishery. The measures to freeze and reduce fishing and farming capacity are a brand new and decisive component of the new plan. Overcapacity has been identified for some time as a key driver of overfishing. Now is the time to address this issue in a real manner and the Community, like other ICCAT members, has to share in the effort to do so.
The introduction of the fishing plans I have already mentioned is another measure. Furthermore, the derogations to minimum size are adjusted. On the Atlantic, pelagic trawlers no longer benefit from derogations, while the derogations applicable to the artisanal coastal fishery have been removed, except for one case. Indeed, only bait boats still benefit from previous derogations. In the Mediterranean, the artisanal coastal fishery now benefits from a derogation. The control measures are reinforced, in particular as regards joint fishing operations, the adoption of a general prohibition of transhipment at sea and the introduction of a regional ICCAT observer programme.
We need to ensure that situations similar to those that occurred last year do not happen again in the future. The best means to achieve this is the speedy adoption by the Council of the new recovery plan for bluefin tuna. Any delay in the adoption of this regulation should, therefore, be avoided, especially if we want to ensure the credibility of the Community at international level and to promote the process of the recovery of this stock. I am convinced that, if this plan is fully respected, it represents a realistic chance for the gradual recovery of bluefin tuna. Consequently, decisive and effective action is immediately needed at the European Community level.
I would also like to remind everyone, however, that no recovery plan will save the bluefin tuna until fishing capacity is reduced, starting with that of certain Community fleets, which are well-known and have been pointed out in this respect for many years. For all these years, the Member States in question have allowed their vessels to multiply to scandalous levels, while the European Commission has stood by passively. That has brought us to this situation, in which there is hardly any way out.
Article 5 of the new recovery plan now obliges Member States with overcapacity to eliminate at least 25% of it by 2010. Not only does that reduction seem to me to be incredibly mild compared with the excesses that have been committed, but, given the precedents, I am exceedingly concerned at the ability of the Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to enforce this obligation, in view of the clear lack of political will that the Member States involved have more than demonstrated.
The fact is that the European Union, or rather three Member States (France, Spain and Italy), together account for half of the world's landings of bluefin tuna. It is therefore crucial that the European Union should be able to supply ICCAT with statistics that are of the same quality as the fishing or the fishing effort expended, not least because statistics are essential if we want to carry out research to answer the needs or questions being raised today by bluefin biology and ecology, which present scientific research with a real challenge.
(EL) Mr President, the draft regulation on the conservation of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, which we are debating as a matter of urgency this evening, makes provision for reduced quota levels up to 2011, fishing restrictions in certain areas and over certain periods, a new minimum size, restrictive measures for sport and recreational fishery, a reduction in fishing capacity and in the capacity of fattening units, reinforced control measures and the application of the ICCAT international joint inspection programme, in order to safeguard the effectiveness of the plan.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we can see from what has been said so far, the ICCAT plan has not yet been fully implemented. This means that the plan regulating tuna fishing methods, which vary greatly from one another, ranging from purse seining to traditional fishing using a system of fixed nets, requires additional fine tuning before it can be applied in full. We must differentiate between the indiscriminate capture of specimens that takes place in the case of purse seining - which is even worse when fleets go over the limits, exceed their quotas, which are not sufficiently monitored, as some people pointed out - and traditional fishing with fixed nets. Fixed nets, by their very definition, make it impossible to go in search of prey: using this system, the fishing season effectively lasts from 50 to 60 days.
When issuing the new regulations, ICCAT must take into account this diversity of fishing systems. It must also consider that the system of fishing for tuna with fixed nets is also a cultural and historical activity that does not damage the environment and provides employment for thousands of people. I also believe that UNESCO should think about protecting this system of fishing because it has cultural significance as well as having an impact on the economy and jobs. It is my view that ICCAT should build additional control systems into its programmes: it should not be possible for tuna to be indiscriminately intercepted before they enter the Mediterranean; it should not be possible for indiscriminate fishing to take place within the Mediterranean, driven by the commercial value of bluefin tuna. I would like to conclude by saying, Commissioner, that it is worth making diplomatic efforts to seek to restrict fishing within the Mediterranean to the countries that line the shores of the Mediterranean Sea - prohibiting others from fishing there - because those countries have an interest in safeguarding the stocks of the Mediterranean fish population and because they share a interest in guaranteeing the future of their fishing.
On the point that was raised by Mrs Fraga Estévez, I cannot agree more that, for the recovery plan to succeed, we need to bring about a reduction of capacity, in particular, of the purse seine fleet, which is the one which causes most pressures on the bluefin tuna stock. In this regard, I would like to refer to the fact that last year, we had agreed on a restructuring package which was triggered because of the fuel crisis and we are encouraging Member States to make use of this restructuring package in order to bring about a reduction of the fleet, in particular, of the purse seine fleet. We are hearing some encouraging news with regard to one particular Member State, France, which is undertaking to encourage certain fishers to decommission their vessels in order to bring about a reduction in capacity.
I need to underline the fact that last year, we closed the fishery early so as not to come under any pressure from any Member State or any group of Member States. We closed the fishery early: immediately when, according to our own calculations, the overall Community quota was exhausted. This year, also as a result of the annual fishing plans that have been agreed on the Community's insistence in Marrakesh, we are prepared to close the fishery early with regard to particular Member States. If the fleet of a particular Member State overshoots its quota, we will not hesitate to close the fishery for that particular Member State. In that way, only the fleet of that Member State will suffer the consequences of its overshooting, and not the fleet of the whole Community. I hope that will be enough to fine-tune our action even further during the course of the fishing season.
Therefore, I do not agree, regrettably, with what Mr Romeva i Rueda said that the recovery plan is a death certificate. I think that the recovery plan, if properly implemented, gives us a realistic and reasonable chance to see to it that the stock does recover. The fact that we have reduced quotas from 15 641 tonnes to 12 406 tonnes in 2009, the fact that by virtue of what we are discussing today and by virtue of the Council Decision which, hopefully, will be taken later in the month, the fact that we are going to implement the Marrakesh Recovery Plan adopted in November, from this very fishing season, is indicative of the fact that we mean business. We are not prepared to accept any abuse of the fishing possibilities that are based on what was agreed in Marrakesh.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a statement on the occasion of the fifth European Day for the Victims of Terrorism. It is a day which must remain in our memory and a day on which we commemorate all the innocent victims of terrorism. This weekend, two soldiers in the county of Antrim in Northern Ireland were murdered by the Real IRA and on Monday, a policeman was shot in the county of Armagh. The policeman who was killed was married and had children. This barbaric act of terrorism has once again torn a family apart and brought with it unimaginable suffering. Yesterday, at least ten people died in a suicide bomb attack in southern Sri Lanka and more than twenty were seriously injured.
Today, we in the European Parliament would like to speak out loudly and clearly against the indiscriminate violence of terrorism. We condemn utterly the senseless destruction of human life, the deaths of entire families as a result of blind fanaticism, which causes people to kill their fellow human beings and to trample human dignity underfoot. Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy. Terrorism is an attempt to destroy by means of indiscriminate violence the values which unite us in the European Union and within our Member States.
Terrorism is a crime which deserves no leniency. Terrorism represents one of the greatest dangers to the security, stability and democratic values of the international community. It is a direct attack on our citizens, on all of us. The European Parliament plays an active role in combating terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks. We cannot repeat often enough that there is no justification for terrorism. For this reason, we must continue to work together to fight terrorism by applying the principles of the rule of law and using all the force of the law. Today in the European Parliament, all our thoughts are with the victims of terrorism, wherever in the world they died. We would like to express our solidarity with them. I would like to ask you to remember in silence the victims of the Real IRA and of the suicide bomb attack in Sri Lanka.
Today we remember the priceless legacy of a man, who, together with Robert Schuman, one of the architects of the reconciliation between Germany and France, took the first step towards establishing a community with a common destiny based on peace, understanding, democracy and cooperation among the people of Europe. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, the principles highlighted by Jean Monnet and the methods he used to implement them have lost none of their relevance. On the contrary, their importance is obvious to us all. The major challenges presented by globalisation, the economic and financial crisis and global warming will cause Europeans to work even more closely together to provide an effective defence for our shared values and our interests in the world. Jean Monnet would, of course, welcome the progress made in the Treaty of Lisbon towards a democratic European Union which is capable of action and of facing the challenges of the 21st century.
And finally, it is important to mention that it was the Action Committee for a United States of Europe established by Jean Monnet which, among other things, proposed direct elections to the European Parliament. In the last thirty years since the death of Jean Monnet, this dream has become an impressive reality with the creation of the parliamentary dimension of the European Union. We are all the heirs of this great European, Jean Monnet, and his work continues to have a lasting impact. It has resulted in fundamental changes to the relationships between the European states and still influences the lives of all of our citizens today.
(PT) I, too, wish to pay tribute to Jean Monnet, but I asked for the floor in order to congratulate the President on his statement on the European Day in Memory of the Victims of Terrorism. It was at my suggestion five years ago that we adopted this position, which the Council approved in a meeting on 25 March, following the tragic attacks in Madrid. However, my speech is an appeal. Parliament has always faithfully celebrated this date, but unfortunately this date has not yet achieved the scope that it should have within the European institutions and Member States. I believe that the celebration of this date is one of our most important ways of paying tribute to the victims, as the President has done, but also of raising the level of public awareness. I know that there are some celebrations in Madrid today, but little else.
Madam President, I welcome the fact that this report looks at what can be done at European level to stimulate the economies, whilst I recognise that most of the instruments to do so remain at national level: 99% of public expenditure is national, not European; most regulation is national, not European. But if we look at what we can do at European level, the plan proposed by the Commission for a EUR 30 billion contribution, including advance payments from Structural Funds and new loans from the European Investment Bank, can and will make a real contribution to coming out of this crisis.
(IT) Madam President, I voted in favour of the joint text on improving safety for those who choose to travel by sea. I think it is very important to add that more should be spent on the professionalism of all seamen responsible for navigation - from the captain, to the chief engineer, to the boatswain, to the master-at-arms, to the helmsman and to all seamen - because the lives and safety of men at sea depends on them. I therefore call for more professionalism and better salaries for those who hold the lives of maritime passengers in their hands.
(MT) On this report I would like to say that despite its initiative in favour of the environment, there was still a lack of consideration regarding the negative and disproportionate effects that it would have on the regions and countries that are situated on the periphery of the European Union, as Malta is. This initiative could potentially bring about a substantial price hike in the transportation of cargo for transport operating to and from these peripheral regions. This rise in costs, in turn, could lead to higher prices on the products that enter and leave these regions or countries. Therefore, I voted against this report.
(PL) Madam President, imposing additional charges on heavy goods vehicles represents an increase in taxation. Lorry transport provides a service to the whole economy, including the citizens. Its costs have an effect on the price of all the products we consume. Burdening road transport, alongside the taxes which already have to be paid, with the additional costs of excise duty on fuel and vignettes, when we are faced with the problem of a crisis to which no end is in sight is socially irresponsible.
I have to say that many of my constituents in the North East of England think they get very bad value for such a large sum of money. Therefore, ensuring public access to the documents of the European institutions is the very least that those constituents could expect in return for handing over such large sums to the EU every year. In the eyes of many people, the EU remains a very obscure and monolithic entity. Anything that we can do to improve access, to give more information to the public on some of the things that perhaps some of our Commissioners and others would rather keep confidential, is very welcome.
Recently, there have been negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and some of the issues that have been debated include a massive erosion of individual civil liberties. There have been proposals, for example, to search people's iPods and laptops when entering countries to check for copyright and non-copyright material. Were we able to debate these in an open and transparent manner? No, because these documents have been kept secret - perhaps for justifiable reasons, but reasons that we do not really understand. Therefore, what we really need is more openness and more transparency in order for us to really get to the heart of the issue.
(IT) I would like to thank those fans who have been tirelessly listening for so long. Madam President, I am one of the 74 MEPs who today voted against the Andersson report, not because I am against employment, but because these guidelines for European Union, for EU Member States policy, do not specifically state that one of the options for encouraging employment is to allow those workers to retire who want and request to do so. This policy of mandatorily raising the pension age everywhere therefore merely deprives young people of jobs when they would willingly replace those older workers who want to leave their positions to the young.
As Europeans and Members of the European Parliament, which was founded on the pillar of equality, we must react to this problem as quickly as possible. The continual oppression of one of Europe's largest minorities is shameful and inefficient. With better regulation and a higher degree of cooperation, nations may be able to provide work for this huge block of potential labourers. With the looming economic crisis, the Roma may be able to help solve some of Europe's deepest problems. In addition, the prejudice against and degradation of these people has gone on long enough. Equal rights and opportunities must be provided to all citizens of Europe, including the Roma.
The truth is that the problems of the gypsy people are largely the simple result of their own refusal to adapt to the society in which they live, certainly as far as education and vocational training are concerned. For decades, we have been pumping millions of euros into all kinds of programmes full of idyllic, but mainly unrealistic, nonsense in the vein of this report. Without any success. Is it then not time we stopped mollycoddling them and looked at the real causes of the problems before we come up with solutions?
I have reservations about any reference to drilling in the Arctic or exploration for alternative sources of oil, such as tar sands. Past months have shown that the importance of energy security has never been as acute. The cooperation that is necessary across the EU, and the need to take advantage of the stimulus packages currently launched by almost all Member States and the Commission, underscore the need for investment in renewables to increase our energy security, to decrease our carbon emissions and to wean us off our high dependence on fossil fuel, albeit over an agreed timeline.
(NL) Madam President, I have abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Lisbon Strategy, even though the resolution is, in fact, on the whole, a very even-handed resolution which gives an accurate diagnosis of the situation and also contains many proposals which I fully endorse. I abstained, though, because the subject of these notorious blue cards for economic immigration has once again been brought up and is receiving emphatic support precisely at a time when more than 20 million people in the European Union face unemployment, which is set to increase even further due to the economic crisis.
The content of the Lisbon Strategy was always far in excess of the EU's capacity to deliver it, and was, in many ways, contrary to the whole ethos of the EU over the past 50 years because, as Mr Heaton-Harris reminded us, much of the EU's employment and economic regulation actually causes more difficulty in achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy than anything else. We are constantly piling on more and more burdens and regulations that force industry out of Europe, and we have no chance whatsoever of meeting any of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy. It is about time we were honest with ourselves and admitted that.
We hear many warm words about the need for the skilled workforce that will be able to adapt to economic upheavals, such as the one we face today. However, across Europe we still face a chronic skills crisis. In my region, the West Midlands, the skilling of the workforce has had a particularly painful and protracted birth. Regrettably, we have the highest proportion of skill-shortage vacancies of any British region. I would, therefore, call on the Commission not to lose sight of the structural reforms needed to reinvigorate the Lisbon Strategy during a period which is beset with economic disorder, higher oil and commodity prices and ongoing turbulence on the financial markets.
Madam President, I entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker. We should consider the fact that the European Parliament has two Chambers - in Strasbourg and Brussels - and we also have three sites, including the one in Luxembourg, which people do not talk about very often. Not only are we building a new block in Luxembourg, leading to more carbon emissions that could well contribute to climate change - or not, depending on what one believes on the issue - but also it is simply hypocritical for us to carry on debating climate change while we continue to operate out of three places of work.
Madam President, I notice that at least some of those who have been denigrating all European legislation, whatever it is, nonetheless voted in favour of the third Maritime Package, a package that I welcome because it increases the health and safety of people on ships; it will ultimately cut costs because it will save lives downstream and it makes safety systems of different Member States compatible with each other, thus making them more efficient, more effective and less costly while, at the same time, improving health and safety. I welcome the adoption of this package, which will make a difference to the safety of hundreds of constituents of mine in Yorkshire and Humber.
The one aspect that I really want to focus on is the recovery plan so far. We need to make certain that we still have secure jobs and sustainable careers for people when the economy begins to perform better and support key sectors such as the car industry. The automotive sector is a model of how traditional industries should adapt in the years to come. I recently visited the Jaguar Land Rover plant in my constituency, where I saw how the company has turned itself into a world leader in green automobile technology, and where the new type-approval guidelines we have been adopting in this House have been welcomed wholeheartedly.
The truth is that nothing can stop this correction: interest rates were held too low for too long and now that the air has been pumped into the balloon, it is going to come out again. We could try to rescue some of the victims but, instead, we engage in this pretence that we can stop the thing happening. The debt will be paid by our children yet unborn and unbegot, and nowhere more than in my country, where every child is now born with a debt of GBP 30 000 because of the incompetence and incontinence of its government.
Madam President, it is very nice to speak after Mr Corbett in such debates because Mr Corbett is never wrong in this place; often confused, as he was today, giving the wrong explanation of vote at the wrong time, but obviously never wrong! I do wonder though whether, in this House, we know what the real economy is. Is the real economy a bunch of paper-pushers and bureaucrats, with us writing laws that other people have to implement, such as the Civil Service in the UK, where we have been growing the public sector way faster than the private sector has been growing over the last 10 years? Or is the real economy actually people doing jobs of work and innovating and starting their own businesses? I just wonder if this report is actually heading in the right direction. Having read it, I am pretty sure that it is not.
German taxpayers (and this is rarely acknowledged) have always propped up the whole system. Integration rests on their sufferance, and they have now seen through this. They are not responding any more to the unspoken appeal to historical responsibility. They are a sensible, level-headed people and can recognise a self-serving argument and spot a racket when they see one. If you think I am wrong about this, then let them have a referendum; let everyone have a referendum: put the Treaty of Lisbon to a vote. Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!
The principle of solidarity is one which is fundamental and unquestionable in the European Union. It is precisely this principle, which exists, indeed, not only on paper, that distinguishes the EU from other international organisations. One practical expression of this principle is undoubtedly the Solidarity Fund, established in 2006 in accordance with an interinstitutional agreement and in order to eliminate the negative consequences of major natural disasters. It is good that the Fund is in operation, and that last year, five countries benefited from it. This is proof that, when faced by a tragedy, no Member State will be left alone. The flood which hit five areas of north-east Romania in July 2008 caused serious material losses (0.6% of GNI) and disrupted the lives of over two million people in 214 districts.
In this situation, I consider Romania's application for assistance to be justified, even if it does not meet the quantitative criteria laid down in Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund. I also have no doubt that in this case, it is necessary to apply the criterion of extraordinary disaster, which is also provided for in the aforementioned Regulation and which allows mobilisation of the Fund for Romania. As a Polish MEP, I represent a region that was also affected by a natural disaster, namely a tornado in the Silesia Province. Fortunately, that disaster did not have the same destructive power or scale. Nonetheless, I fully endorse this tangible evidence of European solidarity.
in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of Mr Böge's report on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund. I agree that the eligibility criteria governing mobilisation of the Fund were met in the case of the application submitted by Romania following the floods that hit the country in July. The floods in fact caused serious damage to the landscape and to the people living in the five regions affected. I therefore feel that it is only right that the Fund should be mobilised, not least because the amount in question falls within the annual limit laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of May 2006.
I voted in favour of the report on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund for Romania as I feel that the financial aid given to our country provides important, necessary support for the locations hit by flash floods in July last year. The north-eastern part of Romania was severely affected. 214 locations and more than 1.6 million people suffered directly as a result of the disaster. The European Commission made a financial contribution of EUR 11.8 million to support the investments made in repairing the transport and drainage infrastructure, reinforcing river beds and building dams to prevent natural disasters of this kind in the future.
I voted in favour of Mrs Haug's report on the amending budget for the financial year 2009, which takes account of the serious damage caused by the floods that hit Romania in July 2008. I have already expressed my support for Mr Böge's report on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund in this particular case, and I wish to confirm here my support for the measure - provided that it focuses - as stipulated in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2006, on the swift and effective restoration of decent living conditions in the regions affected by the natural disaster, and not on the payment of compensation for damages suffered by private individuals.
in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of Mrs Vlasto's report on port State control, which forms part of the third maritime package. I agree with the part of the agreement reached about extending the scope of the directive to include vessels that call at anchorages and with that part about increasing the inspection rate of vessels in the highest risk category. On this point, I refer to the need for assessments of such risk to be as accurate and independent as possible. I also agree that, under certain conditions, vessels should be refused access permanently, in order to guarantee adequate safety levels for operators and passengers.
in writing. - (IT) I believe that the maritime package should be considered globally and as a whole, in line with the approach Parliament has always taken when dealing with its individual parts. I therefore voted in favour of Mr Sterckx's report on establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, since this system fits into a wider context aimed at improving the safety of maritime traffic and making it easier to manage, something which I have already endorsed on many occasions. In the case in point, applying technology for the monitoring of ships would help make it easier to decide who is liable in the event of accidents and to improve the procedures for accommodating ships in 'places of refuge'. For this reason, I feel able to endorse the report by voting in favour.
This text emphasises the need to draw up, at European level, clear and binding guidelines to ensure that accidents at sea are monitored properly. It addresses the concerns that followed the sinking of the Erika oil tanker off the French coast. It is in order to prevent a repeat of such cases of mismanagement that the European Union has decided to impose a strict framework that deals with all the technical aspects and all the processes to be followed in the event of an accident: methodology of the investigations, a European database for marine casualties, safety recommendations, and so on.
in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of Mr Kohlíček's report on the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector. All too often, it is difficult to decide who is liable in the event of minor or serious accidents at sea. I am thinking of the case of the investigations that followed the real natural disaster caused by the accident involving the Prestige oil tanker and of many others that unfortunately continue to occur. Maritime transport deserves special attention because, aside from being the most economical in relative terms, it is one of the most dangerous in terms of the environmental consequences of an accident. I believe it is therefore necessary to establish clear and binding guidelines on how to carry out technical investigations into shipping accidents and to provide feedback to prevent accidents in the future. This is why I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of Mr Costa's report on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents. I agree with him that it is highly appropriate for the provisions of the Athens Convention of 1974 relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea to be incorporated into European law, since the national differences that still exist do not make it possible to guarantee an adequate level of liability and mandatory insurance in the event of accidents involving passengers. Although this does not happen for other means of transport, I believe that the legislation should be fit for purpose in the case of maritime transport as well.
in writing. - (IT) I intend to vote in favour of Mr Savary's report on the insurance of shipowners for maritime claims since I agree with the recommendations made by the rapporteur concerning the need to ensure that the obligation to provide insurance is fulfilled by shipowners entering waters under the jurisdiction of any Member State, including by imposing penalties where a ship is found not to be carrying a certificate on board, should such a finding be made. I agree that the amount of insurance should be set at the ceilings laid down by the LLMC Convention of 1996, which guarantees that the victims of accidents at sea are properly compensated. I therefore support the rapporteur's recommendation to approve the draft recommendation agreed with the Council.
in writing. - (IT) I am favour of Mr Fernandes's report on compliance with flag State requirements. It demonstrates Parliament's determination to maintain the integrity of the third maritime package when faced with interruptions in the Council's work on certain aspects, such as the subject of this recommendation. For this reason, I support the work done by Mr Fernandes and the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I believe that the added value of the political agreement reached should be seen as important, above all since it calls on the Member States to introduce a quality management system for their maritime authorities and to comply with international rules in this area, the most important of which being those resulting from the International Maritime Organisation conventions. Aside from bringing advantages in terms of European flag quality and safety, the proposal will make it possible to improve competition conditions within the Community, and I therefore believe that it should be supported.
The Eurovignette recommendations would penalise peripheral countries and the countries at the centre of Europe would benefit greatly. In my opinion, the Eurovignette recommendations contradict the principles of the Single Market and I think that it is discrimination against certain countries on the basis of geography. Ireland is an island that is situated at the edge of Europe. Lorries from other countries will not be coming through Ireland, but our heavy goods vehicles will have to pay a fee in many countries throughout Europe. There is no way around this: we must carry on business, we must export and import our goods. Under the Eurovignette proposal, countries that are situated at the centre of Europe will have competitive advantages as they will not have to pay the same fees. It is not right or fair to carry out discrimination of this kind based on the geographical location of any country.
Countries with large amounts of transit traffic hold considerably different opinions to more peripheral countries, like my own, which depend on large volumes of traffic for importation and exportation of goods. While, in principle, these are fair, it should be implemented in a gradual and equitable manner. These are issues that we cannot afford to ignore. HGVs are frequently subject to time constraints and external timetables, like those of ferry operators. The construction of a port tunnel in Dublin city has done much to reduce the need for HGVs to be in the city centre, and has increased the quality of air and reduced noise pollution. This was a worthwhile investment.
I am voting in favour of the reasonable compromise on the new Eurovignette. Together with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I have been fighting for years - in the face of huge opposition from parts of the conservative Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - to have the external costs (noise, congestion, pollution) included in the calculation of tolls, in order to transfer the financial burden from the taxpayer to the polluter, in other words, the heavy goods traffic.
in writing. - I support this report which should encourage the shift of freight from the road onto rail. The report is part of a package of initiatives aimed at making transport more sustainable, and ensuring that users will only have to pay the transport costs directly related to their use of that particular mode of transport. Tolls will be charged for local noise pollution, local air pollution as well as infrastructure damage/costs. This will create a fairer system of the 'polluter pays' principle, with safeguards built in to ensure market transparency and avoid discrimination.
Madam President, environmental protection and road safety, the aims behind the draft directive in question, represent two goals that the European Union should pursue with determination to achieve a transport policy more mindful of the expectations and rights of its citizens. A number of amendments to the 1999 EC directive providing for taxation of the heavy goods vehicles that use certain roads are therefore welcome. These kinds of steps forward must be reasonable and gradual in order to prevent the collapse of an important sector of the economy in the current serious economic crisis, a sector almost exclusively based on small and medium-sized enterprises.
I support the work done by Mr El Khadraoui on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, and I have therefore voted in favour of his report. While I do not agree on some points such as including or not including certain external costs in the charge, I do agree with the 'polluter pays' principle. Mr El Khadraoui's excellent work highlights the need to allocate the revenue generated from the charge to the transport sector in its entirety. Lastly, I believe that the revenue generated by charging external costs must not end up being another form of taxation.
The proposal on which we are voting today is a revision and extension of the previous Eurovignette Directive and stipulates the tolling rules for roads. According to the proposals adopted, Member States can, from now on, pass on the cost of air pollution, noise and traffic jams to lorries. This is good news for the taxpayer. At the moment, we are all still paying for the damage caused by air pollution. Soon, it will be the polluter who pays. Moreover, in this way, we encourage transport companies to invest in cleaner lorries.
Despite the progress made by the European institutions on openness and transparency, the situation cannot exactly be described as perfect and this recasting of Regulation (EEC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to documents held by the European institutions should be seen as another step towards achieving an administrative environment where the availability of, and ease of access to, information are the rule rather than the exception. To conclude I would like to point out the great achievement recently accomplished: the European Parliament now uses no fewer than 23 official languages and European Community documents are available in all of these. This represents a guarantee of democracy.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Conservatives have today voted in favour of Mr Cashman's report on the revision of the Public Access Regulation No 1049/2001 so as to work towards increased transparency within the European institutions. As regards Amendments 61 and 103 relating to Article 5, we believe that conciliation documents from the third reading should be made accessible immediately after the final conciliation meeting has ended, in contrast to the documents that are examined in the negotiations themselves. Documents from trilogues in the first and second readings should be fully accessible throughout the whole processes.
in writing. - I very much regret that into procedures intended to develop the principle that the public has a right to see EU documents, the Parliament has inserted emphasis that such rules shall not apply to MEPs. It is argued that this just restates rules already enshrined in the Members' Statute, but to many people this will just look like another case of 'one rule for them and another for us', and I am glad that the Liberal Democrat group did not support the amendments tabled by Mr Nassauer.
I voted in favour of Mr Cashman's report regarding access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. I support his commendable initiative, which is designed to bridge the gap between the common rules on 'classified information' (the so-called sensitive documents cited in the current Regulation No 1049/2001), by maintaining at regulation level some good principles taken from the internal security rules of the Council and Commission as far as these principles can also be applicable to a parliamentary body. Lastly, I support Mr Cashman's general aim, which is to amend this regulation in order to increase transparency without making this instrument too specific and difficult to implement.
What is more, the Commission proposal to review the 2001 regulation that is now before us contains stricter rules, which means less transparency. Accordingly, documents on trade negotiations are deemed confidential. Ultimately, this is a choice between the devil and the deep-blue sea. I therefore support the Cashman report, because, even though it is incomplete, it is, all in all, an improvement on the present Commission proposal. A more radical approach, however, with a total rejection of the Commission proposals would have been preferable because then, the Commission would have been forced to come up with a new and better proposal, which would only benefit transparency of the European institutions and really would bridge the notorious chasm between the EU institutions and the citizen.
Madam President, as we know, the current economic and financial crisis is affecting Europe. I am very concerned for my country, Italy. The crisis means redundancies, and families, who have less and less money, are spending less and less. Therefore we need strong intervention. This crisis appears to be particularly serious, but how deep it goes and how long it lasts will depend on what we do. We must join forces: a coordinated European approach is crucial. Now, more than ever, we can see the pressing need to implement reforms rigorously in order to create quality jobs and welfare for European citizens. We must reverse the trend towards radical restructuring, prevent job losses and stave off further pressure to cut salaries and social security payments.
However, even before the financial crisis, the situation on the labour market did not look at all bright. More and more people were being forced into part-time and short-time work and state-supported jobs were being constantly cut back. For some time, increasing numbers of people have been living below the poverty line, despite being in work. In light of the gloomy forecasts about the economy, it is likely that the number of people in full-time employment will continue to fall and, at some point, that part-time workers will also lose their jobs. We must do everything we can to avoid mass unemployment. It is by no means certain that the measures presented in this report are suitable or satisfactory in this respect. For this reason, I have voted against the report.
A further extension or, to put it another way, a further postponement of the enshrined right of all Members to speak in Parliament in their own language and for all documents to be drawn up in the official languages is neither comprehensible nor acceptable. A number of years have already passed since the accession of certain countries for which the limitation on the use of their language remains, in particular, Ireland and the Czech Republic, without the required linguists having been found. The justification put forward is vague and inconsistent, but financial priority has not been given to their training, which leads us to distrust the intentions. We cannot accept any threat to the inalienable right to cultural and linguistic diversity in the EU, which would also affect Portuguese. We cannot accept this discrimination.
Madam President, I voted for the report. I am very concerned about the recent events in Italy. There is a 'witch hunt' atmosphere developing with regard to Romanian citizens and the Roma, with many punitive expeditions. The Italian Government is engaged in an obsessive security campaign. Adopting extreme measures with regard to Roma communities could however exacerbate the already terrible situation for these minorities and undermine opportunities for integration and social inclusion. We must not forget that, under the rule of law, criminal liability is individual and cannot be attributed to collective groups. To deviate from this principle would set a dangerous precedent that would lead to the criminalisation of entire ethnic groups or particular nationalities of migrants.
The report proposes important directives for action regarding the policy for promoting education among the Roma and encouraging positive discrimination on the labour market. Support for Roma integration into the labour market through funding measures for training and retraining, measures to promote independent activities among Roma, offering concessionary credits and public grants, as well as devising innovative forms of agricultural work, are all objectives which the EU has a duty to coordinate. Creating an EU-level expert group, including representatives of the Roma, could also help coordinate Member States' Roma strategy and the use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.
in writing. - Roma people represent the biggest minority in the European Union and their integration into European society is one of the biggest challenges the EU will face in the coming decade. The Roma, comprising approximately 10-12 million people, have no chance of escaping from poverty and exclusion. Such a degree of social disadvantage hampers the attainment of a basic level of human dignity and equal opportunities for the Roma. I welcome this report which highlights the need to improve conditions for all Europeans, regardless of race.
Oil demand management must not be limited to the EU alone. In percentage terms, the amount of global oil consumed by the EU will gradually decrease in the coming years. The huge growth in demand beyond the EU's borders alone will determine this. Therefore, from the point of view of the security of energy supply in the EU, it will be very important to reduce the growth in demand at global level as well, but without endangering the development goals of third countries or the EU itself. The promotion of market economy price setting mechanisms in third countries is also very important - for example, after eliminating state fuel subsidies.
All of these measures require investment. Investment is only possible when there is sufficient capital and there is a hope of some profit. Therefore, it is essential to overcome the current financial crisis, which may turn into an economic crisis, as quickly as possible. In the last decade, there has been an increase in the number of difficulties surrounding the future security of oil supply in the EU. However, if we succeed in encouraging political will and international coordination, cooperation and the creation of innovations, they may be overcome, purposefully having an impact on both supply and demand.
in writing. - On balance, I can support this own initiative report from my colleague, MEP Reul. As the past months have shown, the importance of energy security has never been as acute. The cooperation that is necessary from all Member States and the need to take advantage of the stimulus packages currently launched by almost all Member States and the Commission underscore the need for investment in renewable technology to increase our energy security and decrease our CO2 emissions. Our years of dependence on fossil fuels have left us with two stark conclusions:
I voted against Mr Reul's report on challenges in relation to the oil supply. I disagree with the rapporteur, in fact, when he states that, according to various estimates, it will be possible to extract sufficient quantities of oil to meet future demand also, but only by charging consumers more and by improving investment conditions. Although I support the Commission's initiatives to prevent oil prices from soaring over the next few years, I do not believe that the situation as a whole has been analysed correctly.
I voted in favour of Mr Jarzembowski's report on the greening of transport and the internalisation of external costs. My opinion, which coincides with that of the rapporteur - who has written an excellent report - emphasises the great benefits mobility brings with regard to Europeans' quality of life, growth and employment within the European Union, socio-economic and territorial cohesion, and trade with non-EU countries, as well as its benefits for the firms and employees involved directly or indirectly in the transport and logistics sector. From this perspective, I welcome the fact that the Commission, in its communication, has compiled an 'inventory' of EU measures to date to promote a sustainable transport policy. This is a small step towards a major objective.
The Jarzembowski report, however, would weaken the Commission proposals. This is why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have tabled positive amendments, including the request for more co-financing between the EU and the Member States, a kerosene tax for air transport and the uncoupling of an increase in transport from economic growth. Our amendments were not accepted, however, as a result of which this report has no added value for the Commission proposals. As such, I have voted against this report.
in writing. - I fully concur that among the impacts of the economic crisis, the rise of poverty in the EU is the greatest concern. It is essential to halt the current rise in unemployment in the EU. I believe that the most efficient way of reducing and preventing poverty is through a strategy based on the goals of full employment, high quality jobs, social inclusion, measures to encourage entrepreneurship and activities to boost the role of SMEs and investments. In a nutshell, this is the most important part of the preamble to the resolution.
The policies enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy and in the European Employment Strategy have contributed to this situation as they promote financial deregulation, market liberalisation and insecurity in labour relations. As a result, what was needed was a break with these policies. However, faced with worsening social and economic conditions, the response (or lack of response) from the EU reflects its class choices, insisting on continuing with policies which promote the accumulation of huge profits by the large economic and financial groups, to the detriment of the living conditions of workers and the general population.
The Lisbon Strategy was thought up in a context and for an economic context which is clearly different from the one in which we currently find ourselves. However, this fact does not mean that all its underlying concepts need to be revised. A distinction must be made between the exceptional nature of the current circumstances and the policies that should be pursued in order to promote European development and competitiveness in the long term. However, it is important not to conclude from this distinction that the crisis situation requires measures contrary to good policies. Quite the contrary. The response to the current situation, although demanding exceptional measures, must be guided by the ideas of good policies and by opting for investment in innovation and in the competitive capacity of Europe, otherwise we will fail both to respond to the crisis and to prepare the Member States of the European Union for the next phase of the global economy.
in writing. - The financial and resultant economic crisis have dwelt a huge blow to European growth and the stability of the job market. In these difficult times, our primary aim must be, as this joint resolution says, to protect EU citizens, whether workers, entrepreneurs, householders, from the effects of the crisis. While the current crisis is undoubtedly devastating, it also offers opportunity: opportunity to change our way of thinking; opportunity to build a strengthening framework for sustainable growth that can withstand potential shocks; and opportunity to build a sound economic and social base for the future.
Among the elements of this resolution that particularly appeal are the recognition of the crucial role of small and medium-sized enterprises and the support that needs to be given to them. Not only do SMEs provide valuable employment, accounting for 80% of new jobs in the EU in recent years, but they also play a key social role in stimulating local economies, diversifying employment and encouraging entrepreneurship. Similarly, the emphasis on innovation - especially in the environmental sector - is very welcome and an illustration that the twin goals of energy efficiency and economic stability need by no means be mutually exclusive.
in writing. - According to the Allianz Group report which was published on Monday, the recession is slowing the EU this year in reaching its goal of becoming the world's leading knowledge-based economic area. In order for us to reach the Lisbon targets, we must do all we can, even in these tough times, to meet these goals. By meeting these goals, we will be able to see our way through the recession, making the EU stronger placed in the future. We must also keep to the Barcelona targets on childcare.
The resolutions by the political forces of capital conceal the causes and character of the capitalist crisis. They shift the burden of the crisis on to the workers, who paid for the excessive profits of capital and are now being called upon to pay for the crisis and to save and increase capitalist profit. The motions call on the European Union to deepen the anti-labour Lisbon Strategy, to apply the Stability Pact and the Economic Recovery Plan and to proceed with the full liberalisation of the internal market. They propose measures to support monopoly groups by granting an abundant flow of money from the workers' pockets, reducing the taxes on capital and increasing lending to large monopoly companies. They are promoting faster capitalist restructurings predicated on the 'flexicurity' strategy and the Directive on the organisation of working time, in other words on increasing working times by up to 13 hours a day and 78 hours a week and dividing working time into active time and unpaid inactive time.
This resolution contains positive aspects, which we value. We would highlight the call for the European Union to actively pursue an agreement in Copenhagen which takes into account the most recent scientific reports on climate change, which commits to stabilisation levels and temperature targets that provide strong probability of avoiding dangerous climate change, and which allows for regular reviews to ensure that targets are in line with the latest science. Likewise, we regard as positive the attention drawn to the need to significantly increase financial resources, in order to allow the necessary mitigation action in developing countries.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Despite the depth and breadth of the current financial crisis, a product of deregulation, cowardly regulators and greedy bankers, we cannot take our eyes off the need to continue to act to halt climate change. We need to see the current crisis as an opportunity to spend resources to achieve a step change in our lifestyles and promote a green new deal across the continent and the world. We cannot achieve our goals unless we work in partnership with the US and Japan, China and India.
The proposals in the resolution will also result in a requirement for greater resources for the EU's Globalisation Adjustment Fund. This will entail an increase in the Member States' fees to the EU. This comes at a time when Member States need to retain their reduced economic resources for their own social and employment policies. We do not believe that the EU's Globalisation Fund is the most effective way to support workers who have lost their jobs. The Member States are better placed to pursue an effective policy in this area. Moreover, the Member States are all spending sums of money on stimulus packages of the same magnitude as their total contributions to the EU's budget.
I voted against the motion for a resolution on employment policy guidelines. In fact, given that the global financial and economic crisis calls for a determined and coordinated response from the EU to prevent job losses, to maintain a satisfactory income level for Europeans, to prevent a recession and to turn the current economic and employment challenges into opportunities, I believe that the measures taken under the governance of the Eurocrats are definitely not enough to bear the weight of the crisis that we are going through, not least in a sensitive sector such as employment.
Among our rejected proposals were those calling for a significant increase in financial resources and quicker application of the funds intended to support employment, and also a redirection of support programmes towards the most vulnerable groups, including programmes guaranteeing decent living conditions and universal access to high-quality public services. I also regret the rejection of proposals such as those which regarded the amount of the Recovery Plan (1.5% of EU GDP) to be insufficient to successfully tackle the current crisis, noting that the EU will lag far behind countries such as the United States and China. Furthermore, I regret the rejection of our criticism of the Commission for linking the Recovery Plan to the expansion of neoliberal 'structural reforms' and to strict compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, when what was needed was to dispense with these and change tack.
in writing. - I can only congratulate my colleague Elisa Ferreira on her report on the European Economic Recovery Plan. I would endorse the sentiments of Poul Rasmussen that we have not yet done enough. The bail out of the banks was a necessary but not sufficient step. We must also take steps to deal with the problems of the labour market. Work-sharing must be encouraged and when short time is demanded, we should encourage maintaining hours at the workplace by utilising the time for training to improve skills.
Determined action is therefore needed, leading to the creation of jobs and a real improvement in the economic situation. A key question is, of course, the so-called healing of the financial system, so that enterprises and citizens can have access to credit. This is particularly relevant to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are, surely, the foundation of the European economy. This is why the effective and rapid restoration of the award of credit must be ensured urgently. Aid designated for combating the crisis must not only be directed at rescuing selected sectors. Such aid is unavoidable, but it should also include an ongoing approach to the competitiveness of European industry. In addition, the crisis must not be used as an opportunity to introduce new, excessively burdensome regulations.
The economic situation has deteriorated so much that it justifies concerted action by the Member States to try to relaunch economic activity. Several observations are called for, however. The exceptional situation we are experiencing does not call into question the basic rules of economics. Borrowing today means debts tomorrow, debts that the Member States will be obliged to repay at a future date. Deficits may be necessary, but there will be a heavy price to pay. We have to be aware of this. There is already talk of increased taxes in the near future to keep public finances afloat.
Despite containing positive elements, Elisa Ferreira's report on the European Economic Recovery Plan suffers from the same problems as the plan itself: it depicts the situation without having properly set out a real understanding of the causes of the current crisis; it lists the initiatives required to restore the confidence of economic operators without, however, having identified to date any evidence of this effect; and it offers little in terms of European mobilisation. For that matter, on this point it should be added that, if this report solves little in concrete terms, that is because the European Parliament has little ability to do so. The same can be said for the European Commission.
Out of this plan's budget, only 15% will be funds managed at Community level. The answer will therefore indeed have to be found at European level, but primarily through the political willingness of the Member States to coordinate their responses to the current economic situation. The impetus must come from the Member States, if it comes at all, given that the current signs of a lack of European political will are worrying. You only have to look, for example, at the contradictory positions adopted by the German or Austrian Social Democrats in the EP or when they are representing the governments of their countries.
The Commission response during the economic crisis has been muted and Parliament believes that more effective tools are required to produce recovery. In fact, an environmental approach could lead to greater innovation and spark renewed productivity whilst also having a positive effect on our environment. However, care has to be taken not to injure specific industrial sectors or reduce our overall economic possibilities, and therefore consideration of a targeted approach is very necessary. Similarly, a new approach to financial supervision denoted by the de Larosière wise men's report is also vital to ensuring against systemic risks.
The economic recovery plan must make new financing instruments possible and, at the same time, by means of regulations, inject stability and reliability into the system. The incentive to go for short-term profit by means of a selection of bonuses must be removed and replaced by rules for so-called lever funds and private equity funds. Transparency, open bookkeeping and supervision must render tax havens impossible. By means of a precise description of tasks, banks can once again become servants of the real economy, where the European Central Bank can act as a guard dog.
The report highlights the extremely adverse economic and social consequences of the crisis in many of the new Member States, which poses a considerable risk of destabilisation and increasing poverty. Spill-over effects are expected to affect the euro and the economies of the eurozone. We urge a coordinated approach at Community level, bearing in mind Community solidarity and the adoption of collective responsibility in this regard. We also invite the Commission to review and consolidate all the instruments aimed at stabilising the Member States affected, which includes stabilising exchange rates, so that security provisions and rapid, effective response packages can be implemented.
I have listened very carefully to the speeches of the rapporteurs and the group chairmen, including the swipe which the group chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament took at the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats with regard to their voting behaviour in respect of Amendment 92. Indeed, we do not agree with the implications of this amendment, and together with my group colleagues, I voted emphatically against it. Surely it cannot be the intention to take short-term measures that undermine long-term objectives?
For this reason, it is not reasonable to force Member States into making a budgetary effort, irrespective of their level of blame, which is an important factor in establishing to what extent deficit spending can be justified. My group was right to hold firm to its opinion which it shares with the Commission, namely that we should also have future generations in mind. This is why it is justified to vary the budgetary incentives according to the level of blame of the Member States. For this reason, demanding a uniform effort of 1.5% of GDP is not viable or justified.
I voted against Mr Kirilov's report on Cohesion Policy: Investing in the real economy. It is, in fact, crucial to understand that the EU's cohesion policy makes an important contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan and is the Community's largest source of investment in the real economy, providing targeted assistance for addressing priority needs and areas with growth potential, both in the public and in the private sector. However, this ought to make us think about the mistakes made in the past that have led to this serious economic situation. Strict legislation is required in this sector, too, otherwise the same mistakes are liable to be repeated in cycles.
After an understandably difficult start - after all, everything was new and had to be invented on the spot, as it were - the Tribunal has turned out to be a very sound, serious and capable legal body that does not limit its activities to administering justice, which, by the way, it does with the greatest care, something which has boosted its legitimacy. In addition, the Tribunal has set up proper outreach programmes to contribute to the assimilation and reconciliation process in the countries that came into being after the former Yugoslavia collapsed.
The Tribunal has also set up a proper completion strategy in three stages to meet the requirements of the Security Council. The plan provides for full completion of all legal proceedings by the end of 2011, with a possible extension into 2012. To provide for all eventualities but, above all, to ensure that Messrs Mladić and Hadžić will, in any event, undergo the same procedure, an effective, highly-qualified and sufficiently equipped mechanism will need to be put in place that can take care of the rest of the tasks, even after the Tribunal's mandate has come to an end.
When the ICTY was set up in 1993, the domestic judicial systems in the former Yugoslavia were unprepared for dealing with crimes of this scale. Yet it was clear that they had to be addressed. No contract, no agreement, no society can be sustainable without justice. Our strategy towards the region is to assist in stabilising the countries of the Western Balkans and helping them realise their EU perspective. A central element of that policy is cooperation with the ICTY. We support its mandate in several ways.
Firstly, the countries of the Western Balkans are part of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP). This process depends on respect for democratic principles, the rule of law, human rights and the rights of persons belonging to minorities, fundamental freedoms and the principles of international law and regional cooperation. It also depends on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. SAP conditionality is monitored through the annual progress reports prepared by the Commission. The next progress reports will be published in October 2009.
Madam President, clearly, the Court in The Hague, with 116 finished cases and much work in the region, can submit a very fine result. Nobody can claim any longer that the guilty get off scot-free. I am also pleased with the emphasis that is placed on the full cooperation that is to be given to the Court. This applies to all countries from which suspects hail. The people that are still on the run should be brought to justice, and all the countries in that region have given their word to the European Union to this effect. We would not be credible if we did not hold firm to this. In fact, with the rapporteur's consent, I will table an oral amendment on this matter tomorrow.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, we need to support, to its conclusion, the impressive work of the Hague Tribunal in bringing perpetrators of terrible crimes to justice and not impose an artificial cut-off, because time pressures would prejudice fair trials while shortcuts would harm the safety of witnesses. While many lower-level cases have been successfully transferred to national courts, some of them may be unable or unwilling to conduct criminal proceedings in accordance with international standards, which means that transfers are sometimes being resisted by victims and witnesses.
Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with the ICTY is a condition of EU accession but the truth is, as Commissioner Orban candidly told me last night in the absence of Commissioner Rehn, that there is no unanimity in the Council as to what that means. That has led to confusion and a consistent postponement of deadlines. Much as we all want Serbia and Croatia to join, the Council, Commission and Parliament must be united and firm in saying that indictees like Mladić and Hadžić must be delivered and, in the case of Croatia, evidence and witnesses facilitated. We cannot afford to relax these conditions.
(NL) Madam President, I should like to bring up a few points in this brief debate. The work of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is of eminent importance, not only because it guarantees that those responsible for the war crimes in the Balkans are brought to justice, but also because it serves the public's sense of justice. Moreover, the Tribunal plays an important role in European policy with regard to the Western Balkans. This is something that is also stressed in Mrs Neyts's report.
However, this cooperation leaves much to be desired, to say the least. During the last visit by the Chief Prosecutor, Mr Brammertz, to Zagreb, in February, where he had gone to ask for the missing documents relating to the use of artillery in 'Operation Storm', which, for the record, resulted in the exodus of 200 000 Serbs and the death of 350 civilians, the Prosecutor demanded Croatia's full cooperation and, although the European Commission has just given the green light to opening Chapter 23 on the judiciary and fundamental rights, some European governments will not hear of it, nor will the European Parliament.
(PL) Madam President, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has made a significant contribution to the process of reconciliation in the Western Balkans and has helped to bring about the restoration and maintenance of peace in the region. It has also contributed to the creation of the foundations of a new world standard for conflict resolution after the end of a war. It should, however, be emphasised that support for development of the potential of national judiciary in the Balkans is a fundamental matter, so that local courts will be able to continue the work which the Tribunal has begun. Proper cooperation between courts and prosecutors in the Western Balkans is another important challenge, especially in cases involving extradition and mutual legal assistance. There is also an obvious need to introduce mechanisms which will ensure that after its closure, the functions of the Tribunal and the material it has produced will strengthen the principles of states governed by law.
Let me just mention that we will be having meetings with the Chief Prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, in Prague tomorrow. I agree that the Tribunal should be in a position to carry out its mandate, complete the ongoing trials and open new ones against the two indictees still at large. I also agree that the legacy of the Tribunal has to be preserved by strengthening the local capacity to deal with the outstanding cases. After all, these are the cases which concern the Western Balkan countries and for which they themselves eventually need to take responsibility.
Ten years after the dirty war unleashed against Yugoslavia by the USA, NATO and the EU, those guilty of crimes against its people are salivating over the thousands of people murdered, including women and children, and over the massive damage they caused in the Balkans. The report in question extols the Tribunal in The Hague which they set up in order to try their victims and exonerate the American and European imperialists of their crimes, a tribunal with fabricated charges, with parodies of trials, which resulted in the murder of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. With unbelievable insolence, they are calling for its operation to be extended so they can set up new guilty parties and exert terrorist pressure on the people of Yugoslavia by calling on them to sign a declaration of repentance for defending their country and of subjugation to their European murderers.
Given the challenges that Europe is facing as a result of an ageing population, leading to an increasing number of people in need of care, combined with changes in size and composition of families, labour market changes and increased mobility which will all impact on the availability of carers, the Commission's Demography Report (SEC(2008)2911) recognised that such challenges would require a variety of policy responses including the strengthening of solidarity between the generations in terms of long term care, greater recognition for professional carers and, most importantly, greater support for family carers.
The Presidency is fully aware of the importance of long-term care in the context of an ageing population. According to Eurostat, the population of over-65s in the EU will double between 1995 and 2050. In its conclusion of 16 December 2008 on public health strategies to combat neuro-degenerative diseases associated with ageing, the Council welcomed the work already carried out by associations that defend and support patients and their carers and called on the Member States and Commission to reflect together on support for carers and to consider ways of developing it further.
(DE) Madam President, I think it is a very good thing that efforts are being made to support relatives so that they can take over long-term care. Unfortunately, in reality, there are not enough relatives to do so. On the contrary, we need an increasing number of highly trained staff. Hence my question: what initiatives will the President-in-Office of the Council take to ensure that sufficient professionally trained carers are available? Has any thought been given to a form of harmonised training, as these are new initiatives?
It is, of course, true that many of those challenges remain in the national competences of the Member States but, at the start of the debate, I mentioned the two conferences. I think Member States could provide training and counselling opportunities to family carers. The development of high-quality education is a key factor for improving the quality of care, as are temporary replacement care and special leave for employees who look after family members. Here, flexible working time, part-time jobs and other care-friendly employment arrangements are important.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I should like to thank Brian Crowley for raising the question. I think you are certainly aware that the Member States are, in the first instance, responsible for designing and implementing their employment policies. However, the Council has a number of responsibilities in the field of employment, including the annual adoption of the employment guidelines in accordance with Article 128 of the Treaty. Especially now that Europe is facing a financial and economic crisis, the Council is paying special attention to the employment policies of the Member States.
You specifically asked in your question about the current initiatives by the European Council to help combat youth and long-term unemployment in Europe. In December 2008, the European Council agreed on a European Economic Recovery Plan to provide a coherent framework for action to be taken at the level of the Union, as well as for measures adopted by each Member State, taking account of their individual circumstances. The European Council's conclusion stressed, in particular, rapid additional action by the European Social Fund to support employment, especially for the benefit of the most vulnerable groups in the population. The European Council undertook to evaluate the implementation of the plan at its upcoming March spring Council, indicating that additions or amendments to it could be made if necessary.
Moreover, the Presidency has decided to organise the Employment Summit so as to maintain a platform for the debate and eventual decisions, and that will be held on 7 May. Topics for discussion will be confirmed after the spring European Council - so we are planning to have the orientation debate on this next week. It should also be mentioned in this context that during this year, the European Parliament and the Council, as the co-legislators, are evaluating and considering amendments to the European Globalisation Fund, an instrument aimed at the elimination of negative globalisation impacts, where job losses certainly belong, as well as decreasing the risk that redundant employees will become long-term unemployed. The aim is to avoid long-term unemployment by timely assistance to the employees affected through activation programmes, such as training, which would enable improved qualifications.
But in light of that employment summit that will be taking place, there are three key issues which have to be focused on and dealt with: firstly, not just using the European Social Fund merely for training but also to ensure that that training leads to actual jobs and is not just training for training's sake; secondly, ensuring that the Globalisation Fund is made more active immediately because the job losses are occurring now; and thirdly, and most importantly, encouraging our colleagues in the Council not to engage in national protectionism of jobs in their own countries to the detriment of jobs in other countries, since if we coordinate and cooperate, we have a better chance of success.
We need to have measures and to react to the current situation, and we are trying to do this. I agree with Mr Mitchell that we need a plan, yes, and we have some plans. We have the European Economic Recovery Plan and we need to implement it. Of course, we are in discussion with and working with the European Investment Bank. Its President Maystadt held a conference two days ago at which he demonstrated how much the EIB had spent since the crisis started - about EUR 10 billion more than in the previous year. There is another initiative by the EIB, together with the EBRD and the World Bank, to allocate resources amounting to more than EUR 24 billion to cover the needs of the various SMEs, for example. That is important in maintaining employment.
Minister, I think the key focus of the question was that of competitiveness and how we retain competitiveness for EU producers. Given that EU producers, particularly of food, have the extra costs of meeting EU standards and, at the same time, compete with imports from countries that do not, in those circumstances could I ask you whether you are persuaded that the CAP should be used to fund maintaining the competitiveness of EU producers? Without that funding, we are going to suffer exactly the fate that Mrs McGuinness has referred to.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I am not among the greatest defenders of the CAP. I am generally in favour of continuing reform of the CAP, but I hope that we will not be in a situation of importing liquid or dried egg. Also, I believe that most of the EC's standards regarding placement on the market are based not just on what we have agreed here in Europe but on the internationally agreed Codex Alimentarius standards and the UN Economic Commission for Europe standards. It is important that everybody follow certain standards, and that we do not create the conditions which would seriously undermine this.
The Presidency has had its first meeting with the new US Administration and plans to have further exchanges as soon as possible. Climate change will be one of the topics discussed during the informal EU-US Summit in Prague on 5 April. The first signals coming from Washington are, in any case, encouraging so it will be crucial to ensure good cooperation between the EU and the US in order for our positions to be as ambitious as possible and to ensure that, consequently, the major emerging economies will follow suit.
The point behind my question is that we should be aware that our younger constituents in particular - and I am sure I am not the only one in this situation - want to urge both this Presidency in its mid-term, and also the Swedish Presidency, to look carefully at what the Americans are trying to do in ensuring that there is no conflict - and Mr Vondra did mention this - between tackling the urgent priority of the economic crisis, unemployment and so on, and encouraging action on climate change, promoting the climate change package and encouraging industries to be involved in the low-carbon economy.
I would like to recall for the Presidency-in-Office that at the Summit meeting last December, all Heads of State and Government agreed to a declaration which stated, inter alia, that, in the context of an international agreement on climate change in Copenhagen in 2009, for those who wished to do so, part of the auction revenues would be used to enable and finance actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing countries which have ratified the agreement, in particular, the least developed countries.
Yes, of course, we need to find common ground. There is the economic crisis; there are those ambitious environmental goals. You are right that we can find a lot of synergies and there is no need to fight. If you read the European economic recovery plans, there are a lot of programmes which have a green cover or a green colour. At the same time, a lot of public explanation lies ahead. The conditions in the Member States of the EU are not necessarily always the same so I expect a lot of public work and public diplomacy lies ahead of us in this area.
Sharing the same concerns as you and with a view to improving the current situation in the short term, the Presidency intended to hold a ministerial debate at a Council meeting in spring 2009 on future development in the area of road safety in the context of the preparation of a new action plan on road safety. However, in view of the fact that the Commission has indicated to the Presidency its intention to postpone the date of the adoption of this new action plan, the Czech Presidency considers this debate to be premature.
One example of concrete action under our Presidency in the field of road safety is a final negotiation between the Council and the Parliament on a proposal for a regulation concerning type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles. As you know, the Presidency and Parliament's representatives managed to reach an agreement concerning this proposal and the European Parliament adopted the regulation yesterday. The general safety regulation requires the mandatory fitting of electronic stability control systems on all vehicles, and an advanced emergency braking system and a lane-departure warning system on heavy duty vehicles. These new technologies can significantly improve vehicle safety and it is clear that road safety will benefit when they are introduced as the standard system on new vehicles.
Agreement at first reading will allow the obligatory introduction of electronic stability systems in new vehicles from 2011, one year earlier than foreseen in the original Commission proposal. Furthermore, the Council has just started the examination of the Commission's action plan for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in Europe and the associated proposal for a directive laying down the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport. Both items have as one of their goals the improvement of road safety through the application of information and communication technologies to the road transport sector.
Intelligent Transport Systems and applications such as emergency call and driver hyper-vigilance systems, speed alerts and alcohol locks could make a considerable contribution to enhancing our road safety. Electronic stability systems and eCall alone could save up to 6 500 lives a year in Europe if they are fully deployed. Given the importance the Presidency attaches to road safety, it will examine any other proposals on these issues that the Commission may present shortly, provided the limited time available until the end of June allows it.
Let me also briefly mention other provisions, such as those in Article 5 of the proposal: Member States would commit to defining national quality and safety standards, to implementing them effectively and to making them public. Healthcare providers would provide all the relevant information to enable patients to make an informed choice - including details of their insurance cover or other means of personal or collective protection with regard to professional liability, which must be in place in all Member States, patients would have a means of making complaints and of receiving remedies and compensation when they suffer harm arising from the healthcare they receive.
Let me also recall that, under the primary responsibility of my colleague Commissioner McCreevy, there is another important piece of EU legislation which regulates mutual recognition of qualifications for doctors, nurses, dentists, midwives and pharmacists. I refer to Directive 2005/36/EC, which is now in force. That Directive also provides for specific obligations for Member States as regards the exchange of information in the case of movement of health professionals. Those flows of data are facilitated by the use of the internal market information (IMI) system, which already allows for the electronic exchange of information on the five main health professions. Furthermore, an extension of IMI to all regulated professions is envisaged.
She raised one or two questions during her submission just now, including her question about why more nurses and doctors are not coming forward. If I may say so, I think that is half the question. The other half is why so many are leaving. The key to this will be to find ways of recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals. That goes particularly, perhaps, for nurses, but also for doctors and for other therapists and so on. I think we have to look at the career structures that we provide. We have to see how promotion is seen as a potential. We have to cut down some of the barriers within and between the professions. We have to ensure that the work environment is pleasant. It is going to be tough but it can be comfortable as well. We have to make sure that research facilities are available in Europe so we do not lose people abroad. Perhaps, above all, we have to listen to the sharp-end professionals. Too often - I know from when I have been in government and you know as a Commissioner - we listen to the top people and we do not go down to the beds and listen to the nurses and the doctors who are actually dealing on the ground. If we did more of that, then perhaps we would get more of our policy right.
I, of course, want to refer - as the Commissioner has referred - to my report, the Parliament's consideration of cross-border health. We said right from the beginning that important with that were the two measures that were not coming at the same time. One of them, of course, was patient safety and we do have a measure that has sped its way on the fast track to join us. This one is somewhat behind. It concerns the health professionals. We do need to have the health professionals providing that service - that back-up - to cross-border health to enable patients to move safely and with confidence. Indeed, standing here in Strasbourg, we think of the Strasbourg, Liège, Luxembourg example of where the reference network concept may be of great value in terms of both patients and training and research.
The Commissioner has referred to the movement of health professionals, and we need to look at ways of making that a reality without endangering patient safety. I think that certainly includes the issue of language tests, which are not an obstacle but must be a protective measure for patients. She has referred to the recognition of qualifications. That clearly is important, whether you are treated at home by an incoming doctor, or you are going abroad to meet a local doctor there. There are some professions - and chiropractice is one - where you have recognition in some countries and not in others. We need to look at ways of bringing those ancillary health professionals into the centre of our planning.
The Commissioner rightly referred to the brain drain. It is tragic that we are not providing enough health professionals but go and grab them from the countries that can least afford it. If you look at the figures, we see, on average, 1 in 4 doctors and 1 nurse in 20 has trained in Africa and is working in OECD countries. It is partly that we as countries pinch them and it is partly our NGOs who also use them and recruit them in the country concerned, pay them more than they would be paid in their own countries. Therefore, they do not go back to work there.
This Green Paper is important, seeing as it concerns a matter that needs to be dealt with. The Green Paper is the result of a controversy that arose over the proposals submitted by Mr Bolkestein at the time, and we welcome the fact that the Commission handles it in this way, with due care, with a Green Paper, and with ample room for debate, because there is, above all, much anxiety surrounding this issue, in my view. This is why I do not want to confine my contribution to the topic of health workers alone, because I think that we will discover the same fear of the unknown in the European dimension in healthcare in other areas too.
A great deal has been achieved in recent years, for example in the area of drugs for paediatric use, a matter in which respect the public is not even aware that there is a problem, but where a European solution is very much on the agenda, because Member States cannot resolve this on their own. It is precisely the economies of scale that come into their own here. I take the view that this also applies to other areas: to the policy on tobacco and discouraging smoking, for example, where the European Union leads the way, not only in the Union, but also beyond. In this instance too, it is precisely the economies of scale that make us effective. We are also very involved in cross-border care and the protection of patients' rights in Europe, also under the watchful eye of rapporteur Mr Bowis, and I hope and expect that we will achieve a positive result in that area too.
Each time, though, with each topic that is discussed, you notice that not only ministers, but also fellow MPs in national parliaments, are reluctant to further deepen European cooperation in the area of healthcare. With 27 different systems in the European Union, we are all convinced that our own healthcare model is the best. Anyone you talk to will convince you that their system stands out. This is, of course, impossible. You cannot have 27 different systems that are all the best all at the same time.
We should nevertheless achieve more, for example - and this is where the value of a Green Paper lies - where the actual free movement of health services is concerned. I am convinced that if we faced up to all the problems, because there certainly are some, and came up with solutions, for example, to prevent medical blunders, or to enhance the legal certainty of patients, but also that of health workers, that eventually everyone would benefit, provided this free movement is organised in a responsible manner but becomes possible nonetheless.
Madam President, I should like to join Mr Bowis and Mr Maaten in congratulating the Commissioner on her Green Paper which is not a day, or even hour, too soon, in my view. The Commissioner said herself that a rise in the ageing population will indeed bring more pressure to bear on health systems, but also, and mainly, on workers. Indeed, anyone who takes the time to listen to the people working in the sector will know that the general working conditions are extremely tough, both physically and often also mentally.
Working in this sector demands a great deal from workers, and is often underpaid. It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that the turnover of staff in the sector is very high. It is also a fact that all too often, the contracts are very precarious, resulting in many people leaving the sector prematurely. In my judgement, the Union will therefore need to pursue a number of things in its policy: sustainable employment, a good working environment, safe work, no brain drain, and decent work.
The first victims of this commercialised health system are the very people who work in this sector. 10% of the workforce of the European Union, these workers, often work under unacceptable conditions which are dangerous to patients. The constant violation of working times is probably the rule rather than the exception. Their pay, in the public sector at least, is being cut, as is their efficacy, due to the choices of private insurance companies. The central theme of the Green Paper is the mobility of workers and the application of the rules of the Bolkestein Directive in the health sector.
However, I wish to take the opportunity to emphasise one aspect of the Green Paper, namely the training of the health workforce. I initiated Written Declaration 0095/2008 on this issue, which is ongoing. I strongly support the idea that it is absolutely essential to develop training communication courses for the health workforce in order to provide clearer and more complete information to patients. Patients' ability to understand health and medical issues and directions is closely related to the clarity of the communication. Despite various initiatives to improve the quality and the availability of health information, studies indicate that patients want more information than they currently receive and that health professionals tend to overestimate the amount of information that is supplied.
I was in Liberia last week and was shocked to hear that for a population of 3 million, they have only 150 doctors. The rest of their doctors are all in the United States of America. This is a very big problem - not only for Third World countries, but also within the European Union, as there is a very serious brain drain from the east to the west. We have to see how we might possibly encourage health workers and health professionals to stay in their home countries. In order to do that, we have to create better work conditions for them.
Mrs Sinnott raised the very important question of how to train more people and offer people more opportunities to train. That is the other side of the coin. On the one hand, we want more health workers, but on the other, we do not have the capacity to train them. All these are very important questions which we shall be able to answer and give solutions to once we collect all the important comments that you and other stakeholders make on the Green Paper. At the end of the process, we hope we will arrive at some solutions to the problem before it becomes truly insurmountable.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for agreeing to accept the procedure laid down in Article 91 and to put this emergency resolution on last Monday's agenda, since, at our last plenary here, in Strasbourg, we already had an emergency resolution on this issue of Sri Lanka. I would also like to thank Parliament for having agreed to this debate taking place this evening, and I thank you, Commissioner, for coming to this debate, as I know the time is difficult for you.
Therefore, we are asking in this resolution for there to be an actual ceasefire. Of course, there will be debate with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats about an immediate or temporary ceasefire. We are really asking the authorities for an immediate ceasefire so that civilians can be removed from danger, because we know that there are people who have been killed. We have had another example of this today with these testimonies. We are asking, of course, in this resolution, for the Sri Lankan Government to cooperate with the NGOs and with countries that are willing to help to resolve this conflict. We are also asking if the European Union can help to deliver desperately needed food and medicines.
Finally, may I say on behalf of my group - since it is on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that we tabled this emergency resolution on Monday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs - that we are asking for this issue to be taken very seriously by some of our fellow Members, who have different interests in this country. I would remind you that, for a long time now, some of the political groups have been asking for the opportunity to speak about the situation in Sri Lanka and that, for internal reasons in some countries, we have not been able to debate this issue of the Tamils and their situation, which has deteriorated since the 1980s.
We are particularly preoccupied about the plight of thousands of internally displaced persons - you are right - trapped by fighting in Northern Sri Lanka. We are no longer facing a crisis but what I think is already a humanitarian catastrophe. This was confirmed to us by a wide range of independent sources, including the UN and the ICRC. The Government's recent announcement about opening two evacuation roads at the north and at the south of the safe zone is a positive step but we want to know how this will work in practice.
We have called on the parties - the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan authorities - to protect the civilian population as required under international humanitarian law and to allow the safe and voluntary movement of people away from the combat zone. Both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan army are responsible for the dramatic increase in civilian casualties during the past months. There is an immediate and urgent need to act to save lives in Sri Lanka, as was also confirmed by the UN Under-Secretary, Sir John Holmes, who drew attention to the high casualty rate, and also the ICRC.
At the end of the day the European Commission continues to be convinced, as I myself would say, that there is no military solution to Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict. An inclusive dialogue is required, leading to a political settlement. Lasting peace and reconciliation can only be achieved by addressing the concerns which led to the insurgency in the first place and by providing adequate space for all the communities. As a Co-Chair, I have always said there can only be a political solution by means of some sort of devolution package, which has been on the table, has been taken off the table, and now has to come back on the table.
We should be resolute in our support for President Rajapaksa in his efforts to end an insurgency that has only brought untold human misery to Sri Lanka and severely retarded economic development on that beautiful island. However, thousands of innocent civilian IDPs still remained trapped on a narrow coastal strip. These civilians must be allowed to leave so that the army can conclude its offensive. It is reprehensible, but entirely to be expected of the Tigers, that they are exploiting these civilians as human shields. The Tigers have been deaf to appeals from the international community to surrender and establish a temporary humanitarian corridor.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I very much welcome this debate in the presence of the Commissioner, whom I thank very much for her serious, her strong and her profound statement. It is clearly a very important subject, although it is regrettable that we are discussing it at 11 o'clock at night with so few people here. But the attendance does not, I think, reflect the interest in this topic, nor the seriousness with which many Members view it. We are, to use the Commissioner's words, deeply concerned about the situation. Tonight's debate recognises also that the situation has moved on and, as Mrs Isler Béguin said at the beginning, that we need to send a strong signal about the deteriorating situation that is worsening day by day.
I support the original resolution tabled, with the exception of the one word 'temporary'. I deplore the language that Mr Tannock has just used, when he said that a long-term ceasefire would be a disaster. Surely - I appeal to you - we are not interested in just a temporary ceasefire. In every case of conflict around the world, this Parliament, composed of compassionate people, has argued for a permanent ceasefire that can pave the way for diplomatic rebuilding, so that dialogue can begin - and, yes - so that we can get that peaceful, just and multi-ethnic society that Mr Tannock spoke about and with which I agree.
Then I turn my attention to Amendments 3, 4 and 5. I would like to read a short piece that I received from a Sri Lankan Member of Parliament in the Jaffna district, Mr Selvarajah Kajendren, dated 10 March. He says 'I wish to bring to your urgent attention the civilian deaths in Sri Lanka. The Army fired artillery shells fitted with cluster munitions from 2 a.m. till 10 a.m. on Tuesday 10 March 2009' - this week. 'The Sri Lankan Government forces indiscriminately attacked all parts of the 'safe zone' using every kind of lethal shells, some of them banned in many countries. In this indiscriminate cluster shelling, more than 130 civilians were killed, including children, and more than 200 were severely injured.'
I doubt that anyone would suggest that this is fabricated. More, I would suggest that we all want to do everything we can to help bring an end to that sort of violence. He also refers to his colleague, Mr S. Kanakaratnam, who is living right in the middle of the 'safe zone'. He says that from 1 January to 6 March this year, 2 544 civilians have been killed in these 'safe zones' by bombing campaigns and well over 5 828 civilians have been gravely injured. Yet the Sri Lankan army, he says, have been bombing by air and artillery fire, killing on average 30 to 40 civilians on a daily basis.
Amendment 6: I refer here to the report by Sir John Holmes, which was sent to me by His Excellency, the Ambassador of Sri Lanka, in Brussels. In the report, he says there is serious overcrowding in some of the transit sites. His words are reflected in my amendment and it is right that we should be concerned about these camps. I have some pictures of the camps. Anybody is welcome to look at these pictures that have been sent to me. Again, I suggest they are genuine and not fabricated. I know that the Commissioner's office in Colombo is following this very closely and has close contacts within the real danger zone.
For decades now, Sri Lanka has been afflicted by a terrorist campaign conducted by the internationally proscribed LTTE. There is no equivalence between terrorists and the legitimate forces of a democratic government. Let us remember that it was the LTTE that perfected suicide bombing as a tactic, that it pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks, and that it makes undisguised use of child soldiers and of human shields. Over the last 26 years, it has systematically carried out thousands of deliberate murders across Sri Lanka and, just two days ago, 14 people were murdered in a suicide attack during an Islamic festival in the Matara district.
The LTTE is now in a desperate end game and, typically in such situations, is turning to international apologists to get it off the hook. A tiny minority of Members of this House were unhappy with the resolution passed by the majority in this Parliament and, disgracefully and improperly, they wanted to focus condemnation on the Sri Lankan Government. We cannot support amendments based on unattributable - and often nonsensical - allegations, as we have heard from Mr Evans, or selective quotation from one NGO report. We have no good reason to dispute the Government's firm assertion that its troops have not fired on no-fire zones and will not do so.
However, I must say that, in this sort of war, the LTTE should make a move and unfortunately, is not doing so. You too mentioned that and the Foreign Ministers again urgently called on 23 February for this organisation to lay down its arms and end the terror. Just imagine a Member State of the EU in which terror has reigned for 25 years. That there is a great deal of chaos and disorder there is easy to imagine. I support the Tamils' cause, but I reject the LTTE's methods equally decisively. For weeks, we have heard that in this small district, more than 100 000 people have simply been seized. Reuters reported just yesterday that, according to eye witness reports, people are being shot when they try to leave this zone. So we need to call on the LTTE and the forces behind the LTTE to end these practices. The game is up; they cannot carry on like this.
Obviously civilians in this war zone are exposed to barrage fire from both sides. We must also call on the government to respect international law and permit humanitarian actions. It is the fundamentalism on both sides that is demanding so many victims. I think we should prepare for post-war order. As you said, the 13th amendment in the Sri Lankan constitution must be implemented, which provides for decentralisation in the sense of regional administration by the people who live there and the EU can provide valuable help here. I am sure that you in the Commission and we in the EU are prepared to do so.
(NL) Mr President, what is happening in Sri Lanka now has been in the making for quite a few years. It is not simply a humanitarian problem, but mainly a serious political failure. After years of violent struggle for the separation of the North-East of the country, a previous administration of Norway offered mediation between the Sinhalese majority government and the rebel Tamil movement. The Norwegian negotiator who worked for a long time to reach peaceful solutions is now a minister in the new government himself. Unfortunately, though, this option for a peaceful solution has since been abandoned.
In the summer of 2006, the Sri Lankan Government ended the peace attempts and opted again to unilaterally impose a military solution. This government is now probably labouring under the illusion that it managed to achieve a major success, whereas in reality, a peaceful, harmonious co-existence of the two peoples as equal partners will be even more difficult in future. Without a compromise on a peaceful solution, the future looks gruesomely violent. We have to revert back to peace mediation without winners or losers.
There is much evidence. It is not circumstantial. Some of it is from the office of the regional director of the health services of the Sri Lankan Government, which talks about a humanitarian catastrophe and the substandard conditions in which people are living. This is echoed by the European Commission, the ICRC, the UN, the International Crisis Group and Refugee Care Netherlands. The title of the debate this evening is the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, and we have a duty to do everything we possibly can to prevent that, which I think we can, if we find the right way forward.
Since the beginning of this Commission's term of office, as a Co-Chair, I have been very much preoccupied by Sri Lanka. There were moments when we had some hope - rather more at the beginning - but hope has now faded away. I wanted to take part in the Geneva Process, but it seems that was difficult for the Government of Sri Lanka. In any case, this process unfortunately broke down. I was also ready to go up to the north to start mediation, like my predecessor, Chris Patten. But the north was not ready - officially Mr Prabhakaran had measles or chicken pox. In any case, I am in complete agreement with Mr Gahler, who said - and this is also my own concern - that we should put people and humanitarian concerns first.
As is so often the case, we have been the largest humanitarian donors in Sri Lanka. In 2008-2009, we allocated EUR 19 million for humanitarian assistance, which was then channelled through partners like the ICRC, the United Nations and also some international non-governmental organisations. These organisations are ready to help the affected populations, but they have real problems - which they tell us about - in gaining access to the conflict area. Since September 2008, the ICRC has been the only agency allowed to operate in the LTTE controlled areas in Vanni. The World Food Programme has been allowed to send some food convoys, but this has only been sufficient for around 50% of needs. Since 2008, we have provided another EUR 7 million in humanitarian assistance to the two organisations. We have also been pushing consistently, in both Colombo and Brussels, for better access to these populations by humanitarian organisations.
Therefore, I can only say - together with the other Co-Chairs and also particularly with Norway - that we have used every opportunity to press the parties in conflict to implement the 2002 ceasefire agreement and to solve the conflict using peaceful means, but nothing has worked. Numerous calls for a return to negotiations have always been totally ignored and unfortunately, the military route has prevailed. The scope for intervention by the international community has narrowed more and more over the last three years, but not one of the Co-Chairs has abandoned the mission. We have all remained committed to contributing to a peaceful solution to the conflict, as can be seen from the last Co-Chairs' press statement released on 3 February, of which I am sure you will all be aware.
Madam President, I share your hope. Unfortunately we cannot hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will take advantage of this debate and this discussion to help advance the position of the European Union. In fact the Czech Presidency evidently considers a common European policy to be a barrier to the great national foreign policies of our national states. China is grateful for this, Russia is grateful, that is to say repressive and anti-democratic countries all over the world give thanks for this absence of Europe that is so well illustrated by the absence of the Presidency in this House.
I would like to point out to Mrs FerreroWaldner, as we tackle this point together, what is in my view the ultimate issue: it is not just a question of law and order - in other words looking at how many monks have been arrested and how many Tibetans have been killed recently due to brutal Chinese repression, hoping that the count will be lower than it was a year ago. What I would have liked to say to the Council and will now say to the Commission is that it must give an opinion on the fundamental political point, that is on the talks between the People's Republic of China and the envoys of the Dalai Lama, the aim of these talks and the reason why they were suspended - we could now say they have failed - unless we can revive them.
There are two opposing positions: on one side, the position of the Chinese regime, which says the Dalai Lama is a violent man at the head of a violent people, and that the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile want independence for a national Tibetan state, which runs counter to Chinese territorial unity. That is the line taken by Beijing. On the other side, there is the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama's envoys, who say they seek something else, that their means of fighting is through non-violence and that they simply want true autonomy, meaning autonomy to retain their culture, tradition, language and religion, or their cultures and religions. This is the message of the memorandum that the Dalai Lama's Tibetan envoys presented to the Chinese regime. This memorandum has been published and contains their demands.
At this point the European Union is being asked to choose, to take sides. There are two conflicting positions: one of the parties is lying. The EU can be decisive in the search for the truth. As the Radical Party we propose satyagraha, the search for truth, as a collective global political initiative. The European Union should make use of its diplomatic tools - Mrs FerreroWaldner, please say this to President Barroso - we must meet with the Dalai Lama and do him the honour of allowing him to speak, in order to find the truth. Is Beijing right in saying that the Tibetans are violent terrorists favouring independence, or is the Dalai Lama right in saying that they want a decent and dignified autonomous state? Europe cannot stand still and remain silent in the face of this conflict.
Madam President, 50 years ago, the Chinese army delivered the final blow to Tibetan resistance. Since then, Tibetans have fled, with an inordinate amount of effort, over the Himalayas and across the borders into other states. Up to now, several thousand people a year - all of whom are refugees - have made this supreme effort to cross 5000 m high passes. If, as China has always claimed, the situation of the Tibetans is so wonderful, there would be neither grounds for flight nor justification for the fact that journalists, people from the West and observers have been prevented for months from visiting this country at all or only under close escort. Female journalists are even followed to the toilet by female intelligence service observers to ensure that nothing forbidden can be done.
Before I come to the many issues you raised in the tabled joint resolution, let me also have a quick word on our bilateral relations with China. The EU policy vis-à-vis China is one of engagement. Our strategic partnership is strong, and this permits us to tackle all issues, including the most sensitive ones. We have constructed an impressive framework of high-level interaction where we regularly address all the global changes that our citizens are facing, without neglecting the issues where we may disagree. Tibet is one of them. Let me be very clear - we do not see eye to eye with China on Tibet, and we still have a very real and legitimate concern about the human rights situation in Tibet, as you have both just outlined; about the fact that Tibet has remained largely closed for the international media, for diplomats and for humanitarian organisations for almost a year now; and about the stalemate in talks between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, despite the three rounds of talks last year.
Let me again mention the EU's position, which does not leave any room for misinterpretation. Firstly, we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China, including Tibet. Secondly, we have always supported a peaceful reconciliation through dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama's representatives. I remember, when I went there with the Commission, President Barroso and other colleagues, I had specific dialogues with many of my interlocutors on this issue. We have always maintained that there should be a reconciliation dialogue and that the dialogue should go on.
This dialogue has to be constructive and substantive, and of course we therefore regret that, up to now, this dialogue has not brought really substantive results. We have always said that the dialogues should address the core issues, such as the preservation of Tibet's unique culture, religion and traditions as well as the need to achieve a system of meaningful autonomy for Tibet within a Chinese constitution. We have always said that this dialogue should address the participation of all Tibetans in decision-making. Therefore we would welcome it if these issues were to be addressed in China's future national human rights action plan.
For us, Tibet is a human rights issue and has therefore invariably been approached as such. We have also consistently passed this message to our Chinese counterparts and listened very carefully to their views. We have made every effort to understand the position in a spirit of mutual respect, but human rights are universal, and the situation in Tibet is therefore - rightly - of international legitimate concern to the whole international community, particularly the European Union. This fact is, of course, emphasised by the existence of instruments of international law for the protection of human rights over half a century.
Let me conclude by sharing with you a personal conviction. Throughout my political and personal career, I have always strongly believed that, through engagement and dialogue, even the most difficult issues can be addressed and hopefully, when the time is right, can also be solved. Therefore I wish to appeal to China and to the Dalai Lama's representative to resume this dialogue at the earliest possible opportunity with an open spirit and a view to achieving a durable solution in Tibet. I can guarantee, from our side, our wholehearted support for such a process. This is our position and this is the position that we bring to the Chinese side.
In 1950, Communist forces invaded Tibet, leading to the exile of the Dalai Lama 50 years ago. Ever since then, Tibet has been under the control of Beijing. The traditional Tibetan culture, which was isolated for hundreds of years, has now been heavily diluted by the actions of the Government, which has been at pains to prevent any sense of Tibetan nationalism from resurfacing. In fact, the systematic and sometimes brutal suppression of Tibetan culture has kindled the fire of Tibetan identity and awakened the world's conscience to the plight of the people of Tibet.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the Socialist Group is concerned about the human rights situation in China. While we recognise that the situation has improved significantly over the last 10 years, there are still many areas where human rights are still not properly or adequately protected. There may be a degree of freedom of thought, but there is not freedom of action. We would certainly highlight the failure to allow free trade unions to operate within China. We are concerned about the plight of the 100 million migrant workers who have moved from country to city and who have the most limited access to health and education. We are concerned about the plight of religious and ethnic minorities across the whole of China.
Nevertheless, the Socialist Group was opposed to this debate and resolution. The reason was proportionality. It is right to criticise China for its human rights record, as we criticise the United States for its use of the death penalty, Guantánamo and extraordinary rendition, but we do not have to do it every part-session. Frankly, it is becoming counterproductive. At one time, the Chinese authorities paid heed to our resolutions, but no more. As some individuals and groups in their desperate attention-seeking continue to up the ante with today a demand, I think for the first time, that Member States should abrogate the one-China policy and recognise the Tibetan government-in-exile.
I, along with Elmar Brok, Philippe Morillon and other Members of this Parliament, had the opportunity last summer to visit Lhasa. We were the first international group to travel there after the troubles in March and spoke both to the authorities and those who were sympathetic to the Tibetan protesters. As I wrote afterwards, the reality was that peaceful protests - and we support peaceful protest - turned into race riots, when shops, homes and Han Chinese were attacked and burned, with dozens of deaths. Schools suffered arson attacks and hospitals and mosques of the Muslim minority were attacked. The Dalai Lama himself recognised the reality of the situation when he threatened at the time to step down as a living god.
Madam President, during the last few decades, democratic countries have called, on numerous occasions, for human rights to be respected in non-democratic countries. These efforts have been effective only when countries and international organisations have been consistent in their actions and demands. Unfortunately, the case of Tibet or, more broadly speaking, the issue of human rights in China, has generally often been pushed to the sidelines, with trade relations taking priority. If it were not for the Olympics in Beijing, and the decisive stance taken by many social and non-governmental organisations, the world would still know very little about the situation in Tibet.
It is worth remembering that, in its resolution of 6 July 2000, the European Parliament called on Member States to recognise the Tibetan Government in exile if, within the space of three years, no agreement had been reached between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama's administration. As we know, Beijing still refuses to engage in talks with the indisputable leader of the Tibetan people. Let us also not forget the Eleventh Panchen Lama, the youngest political prisoner, who has been in Chinese custody for 14 years. He will be 20 this year.
A country is not made great by its military strength or its size or its economic wealth. What makes it great is the magnanimity of its acts and its generosity. The European Union can and must help to resolve this situation, while of course respecting the sovereignties involved, but it must do so firmly. The way to do this is to support the Tibetan request to restart the Chinese-Tibetan talks and to recognise that, if anyone has spent years giving way to and being pressurised by the Chinese authorities, then in this case it is the Tibetan people.
(DE) Madam President, on 10 March 1959, the Tibetan people were subjected to unspeakable suffering at the hands of the Chinese. Sixty thousand people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands were arrested, taken away and tortured in the months that followed. A year ago, the violence escalated once again. More than 200 Tibetans died, some as a result of deliberate fatal shots, and now - shortly after the 50th anniversary - monasteries are closed to the outside world, access roads are controlled and soldiers and security men stand in readiness to nip demonstrations in the bud. We still have no news of possible rioting. What is the response to this show of power? Silence in the media. The Dalai Lama has urged his people to maintain the path of non-violence. His call for dialogue has had no positive response in Beijing. When an envoy of the Dalai Lama presented specific steps for autonomy in a memorandum, they were rejected by President Hu Jintao. He said, 'we must build a Great Wall against separatism'. This idea, which is pure provocation, was topped by the planned forced introduction of a holiday for Tibetans: 28 March is to be Serfs' Emancipation Day. This is the bitter reality.
Two days ago, the European Parliament displayed flags. In plenary, an impressive number of us placed the Tibetan flag on our tables and showed our solidarity with the suffering Tibetans. There were peaceful protests in all parts of the EU. Our fellow Members - Mr Cappato, Mrs Lichtenberger, Mr Tannock and Mr Romeva i Rueda - are absolutely right: today's resolution speaks loud and clear. The memorandum must form the basis for further negotiations. It is a document for true autonomy within the framework of the Chinese constitution. The isolation of Tibet must stop - for the inhabitants, for tourists, for journalists. We must have an answer to 600 imprisoned Tibetans.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament cannot allow the recent cry of pain from the Dalai Lama to go unheard. Only a few months ago we listened to him speak in Brussels; we all know him to be a gentle man, a peace-maker, a spokesman for Tibetan culture, that is to say the culture of harmony and fraternity par excellence. It is in the name of these values, speaking of his 'Chinese brothers', that the Dalai Lama has asked - forcefully, however - for legitimate and tangible autonomy for Tibet, recalling the torture and terrible suffering of his people and his land. This is a request that Parliament should be proud to support. It is our political and institutional duty, in the name of democracy, human rights and the values of freedom. The Tibetans look to Europe, perhaps, as their only hope; we really must not disappoint them.
To be honest - as my fellow Member has already said -the government did hold these talks last year, but broke them off after the Olympic Games. We are forced to suspect then that these talks were only conducted during the Olympic Games to divert our attention. However, Mr Ford, we will not allow our attention to be diverted. We will place this matter on the agenda time and again and we call on the Chinese Government to enter into real and serious talks with the Dalai Lama, as human rights are still being violated in Tibet and we must ensure that this situation changes.
I deeply regret the fact that the Chinese Government no longer guarantees the freedom of the press. At the same time, there is absolutely no freedom of the press for journalists in China. Chinese journalists apply a system of self-censorship that requires them to adopt the government's position. In this case, too, there is a world of difference between the law - which is sound and guarantees the freedom of the press - and the reality on the ground, where journalists have to impose restrictions on themselves. All the media have to submit to the censorship diktats of the parties.
What is more, the government also blocks websites. Internet users inform one another quickly of political developments as they happen. For the dialogue between the Tibetans and the Chinese - the population, the people - it is crucial that they have accurate information. Negotiations can only be held on the basis of facts, and the freedom of the press in China is an important precondition for that to happen. There must be freedom to write, to enable journalists to inform the rest of the Chinese people about what is going on in Tibet.
The European Union's relations with China are of strategic importance to all Members of the European Parliament and they do and will have major global repercussions. I would have expected us to discuss the European Union's cooperation with China in reforming the global financial system, bearing in mind China's balanced and constructive position, especially now, before the G20 summit in London. It could have been the right time to put Africa on a common agenda, bearing in mind the major role which China plays there, and I could continue.
(PL) Madam President, in the early 1950s, the Chinese Government forced Tibetan representatives to sign an agreement in which it guaranteed Tibet far-reaching autonomy. These guarantees came to nothing. As a result of public pressure and the fear of a boycott of the Olympic Games, the Chinese Government began talks with the representatives of the Dalai Lama. However, these talks were held at a gallingly low level and, moreover, the dialogue was akin to communication between two televisions, set to different channels.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this debate has briefly but clearly shown once again our great concern at the situation in Tibet. The interventions have underlined that this concern remains as real and legitimate 50 years after the Tibetan uprising of 10 March 1959. Moreover, I think our discussion has also underlined the necessity for both parties to resume dialogue promptly. I say 'dialogue' because dialogue is always the first important step before moving on to negotiations. It is also the best way to avoid frustration and violence among young Tibetans. I think this is a very resonant reason. That is why a more substantial dialogue is in the interests of both sides.
For 50 years, Tibetan refugees have been calling for their fundamental rights to be respected. I am convinced that respecting these rights and reopening the process of dialogue with the people of Tibet is clearly in China's interest. In today's world, a country's image is an important part of the way it operates within the global economy, and in terms of international cooperation. China's refusal to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama's representatives, and its rejection of the extremely moderate demands of the Tibetans, is harmful to its image. Engaging in talks on rights which are in accordance with the principles of the Chinese constitution would not pose any significant risk for China. In fact, quite the opposite is the case. Great countries and great nations should be magnanimous. Such behaviour may provide proof of their greatness.
Engaging in a dialogue with Tibet provides China with an opportunity to show its good, positive, side. Showing solidarity with Tibet and the Tibetan people is not anti-Chinese. It is an expression of concern for human rights, religious and linguistic freedom, cultural diversity and the right to maintain one's national identity and autonomy. Therefore, we are not interfering in China's internal affairs, but merely trying to defend standards and values which are important to us everywhere - in Europe, Asia and throughout the world. China has not been singled out in any way. We defend the rights of small nations even when this proves to be bothersome or uncomfortable. This is because we believe that it is the right approach to take.
I would like to take the opportunity to urge our Slovene Members, for whom and for whose country I have the greatest sympathy, to find a way once again of continuing Slovenia's great achievements towards European integration. This country was the first new Member State to introduce the euro and was the first to implement Schengen. Slovenia is a pioneer of European unification. I would like to see Slovenia, in its national interest, also act as a pioneer in connection with the accession of Croatia to the EU.
(SL) It is my sincere wish that Croatia becomes a member of the European Union as soon as possible and this is a wish that is shared by Slovenia. If our wishes are to become a reality, we need to assist and cooperate with Croatia. We can resolve disputes by listening carefully to all of the parties involved. However, there is nothing in this report, which was endorsed by the European Parliament today, which suggests that we have struck the right balance in voting on the so-called Croatian-Slovenian border dispute. In order to avoid bias, we should also include the principle of equity as a minimum requirement.
(BG) Thank you, Mr President. I supported the Turkey progress report. The negotiations with Turkey on accession to the European Union pose a serious challenge to all Member States of political and economic significance, as well as in terms of the issue of security. It is particularly important for the country to meet the accession criteria and show consistency, sufficient precision and transparency towards the citizens of the European Union. I feel that it is especially important for the process to progress via good cooperation with neighbouring countries. In this respect, I think that we must note certain progress between Bulgaria and Turkey with the agreement which has been reached on initiating negotiations on matters which remain unresolved so far, specifically on resolving the property issues of the Thracian refugees, which is happening thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament. We will monitor this process particularly closely as it concerns the rights of thousands of people, which must be respected across the territory of the European Union. The Thracian question is also just as important as relations between Turkey and the other neighbouring countries. Thank you.
Yesterday Mr Wiersma mentioned that failure to acknowledge the 1915-1916 Armenian genocide is a problem. What should we say then about the acts of genocide against the Bulgarians which went on for 500 years, such as the massacres in Stara Zagora, Batak and Perushtitsa, described by the International European Commission in 1876? Mr Wiersma also said that there is no place in the EU for an Islamist Turkey; however, 20 years ago Turkish Islamists blew up coaches in Bulgaria, carrying women and children. Indeed, Turkey paid for monuments to be erected for these terrorists. This is modern Turkey, governed by a fundamentalist, Islamist party. These are its values and we think that they are not appropriate for Europe.
However, I have nevertheless quite clearly voted in favour of the report, because the Socialist call to focus the report on accession was rejected. This report is a great success and a breakthrough for us, because it expressly avoids setting accession as a goal and because it talks about a long-lasting, open-ended process, the outcome of which is still unclear. We would have preferred a 'no' to full membership, but this wording nevertheless comes close to that and is therefore a great success for those of us who are happy to say 'yes' to partnership with Turkey as part of our foreign policy, but say 'no' to accession.
However, it is also important for us to be honest with Turkey, and to say clearly and unambiguously that, if it fulfils all the conditions that other Member States have fulfilled, then it has the right to join. It is not right for individual heads of Member States to put unfair and unbalanced obstacles in the path of Turkish membership. If Turkey fulfils the conditions, then it has the right to join, and should be permitted to do so. We need an EU which is wider and not deeper.
(HU) For the last three years, Macedonia has been a candidate country for EU membership. In spite of this, accession negotiations have not yet begun. Unless the European Union promptly takes decisive steps, the resulting loss of credibility could have destabilising consequences for the region. Macedonia has progressed a great deal in the last few years, achieving good economic results, moving closer to a functioning market economy and showing success in the field of lawmaking. Consensus has been reached among government and the opposition, civil society and public opinion in order to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria as soon as possible. Coexistence between national and ethnic communities has also been well organised. Greece's stubborn obstruction of the start of negotiations for accession is beyond comprehension. The naming of the country must not be an obstacle! Bilateral talks about the name can be held simultaneously. I support the report because it is an important message to the Macedonian people and will give a decisive impetus to starting genuine negotiations before the end of this year. Thank you very much.
(DE) Mr President, this report sends an important signal to a country that is playing a stabilising role, has exemplary legislation on minorities, has a broad government majority in which all nationalities are represented and has taken a clear European course under the leadership of Prime Minister Gruevski. I therefore gladly voted in favour of this report, and I believe that we should emphasise two points in particular: firstly, we want the Council and the Commission to tell us this year when accession negotiations are to begin and, secondly, we will not tolerate any bilateral troublemaking, and definitely not with regard to this bizarre name issue. The country is called Macedonia, whether that suits some people or not, and we must finally start to smooth this country's way towards Europe.
I visited Macedonia very recently, on behalf of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, set up by Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister of my country, and saw a country with vibrant political parties and a fascinating tax policy, with flat taxes on both corporation and income tax, and a growing economy. It is a country that this coming month is going to have free, fair and honest elections - probably better than the ones we recently had in the UK, with postal votes. Such a country should be allowed to join the European Union, should it choose to, based on its own self-determination - which is why my previous colleagues should possibly reflect on this matter.
For the accession negotiations to be held up not because of an ethnic dispute or a democratic dispute or a human rights dispute but purely because the country decides to name itself Macedonia, is patently ridiculous. I hope that the Greek Members will see the sense of this. I hope that Macedonia will be judged on free criteria that apply to everybody else and, if they fulfil those criteria, if they are a democratic, secular state, if they pursue the right human rights policies then, like all other Member States, they should have the right to join and not be subject to a ridiculous veto by Greece purely on the grounds of the name.
Mr President, the growth of a corpus of international jurisprudence not anchored in any elected national legislature is one of the most alarming developments of our age. We are reversing not just 300 years of legal understanding of territorial responsibility, that is, that a crime is the responsibility of the territory where it is committed; we are also going back to the pre-modern idea that people who decide on laws should not be accountable to the people who live under them, but rather only to their own consciences.
It might seem very reasonable that, if a man like Milošević or a man like Karadžić is not receiving justice in his own country, we need to do something about it. But the objection to authoritarians like Milošević is precisely that they vitiated the democracy of their country and set themselves up as being above the law. If we replicate that problem internationally, we drag ourselves down to his level, as we did with the farce of a trial we had in The Hague, where for six years we had 27 changes of legal procedure, imposition of counsel and, ultimately, no conviction.
We have seen in recent times how the relentless pursuit of profit has brought the global economy to its knees. We certainly do not want to see the same thing happening where water is concerned. In order to ensure water quality and ongoing improvements in the distribution system, there needs to be continued investment in the transition system. There is no incentive for those in the private sector to do this because, of course, the temptation is simply to increase the price to the consumer, rather than invest in upgrading the transmission system. I have seen this happen in my own county of Sligo, where certain sectors of the community will end up paying more for their water than their fair share because there is simply a lack of investment by the private sector in the transmission system.
We cannot allow a situation where either the strategic partnership arrangement - or indeed a world trade agreement - has a negative impact on Europe's food security concerns. I reiterate the issue around food production standards, which are higher in the European Union. We penalise our producers where they do not meet those standards. We cannot allow a situation where we bring in food from third countries - Brazil or elsewhere - which does not meet our production standards and which results in very unfair competition for producers of food and agricultural commodities within the European Union.
(NL) Mr President, of course a strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico, and also, in fact, countries like Brazil, is a good thing and something that is in the interests of the EU. The report itself is framed in a largely balanced way, but what I would say is not in the interests of Europe - and this is something that will also give rise to a whole range of questions amongst the general public - is the provision in the report that calls for the conclusion of a mutual agreement on an immigration policy. This does not bode well and it is also the reason why I chose to abstain in the vote on this report.
(IT) Mr President, I take the floor to express my satisfaction at the widespread support the Assembly has given to the motion that we have put forward with Mr Pannella and Mr Onyskiewicz, The motion does something different from what we heard from Mrs FerreroWaldner today; that is, it takes sides: the side of the search for truth, for the real reasons why talks broke down between the Chinese and the Tibetans, rather than looking at this from a neutral standpoint, as the Commission and the Council unfortunately continue to do, as if it were enough for us to simply hope for dialogue between two parties.
I would like to stress that the behaviour of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament seems to me to be particularly hard to understand; first they were opposed to the debate, then they were opposed to my tabling a resolution, and then they actually voted against it, with Mr Ford offering a political explanation that we are passing too many resolutions on Tibet. Well, perhaps the party and Mr Ford do not understand - or else they understand all too well - that much more is at stake here; the freedom and democracy of more than a billion Chinese citizens as well as the Tibetan people.
author. - Madam President, my group proposes to delete paragraphs 2 and 6. This is not because we do not support the content but because we do not think it is necessary in this resolution and that, given the delicacy of the situation, it might help get Mr Al-Bashir to reverse his decision and allow the NGOs to go back. So we are calling for the deletion of paragraphs 2 and 6. I understand there will be a similar request from the Socialists and they will also be requesting the deletion of paragraph 5, which we also support for similar reasons.

Before turning to the substance of my report, I want to pay tribute to my colleague, Glenys Kinnock, who, as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, has been at the forefront of making concerns about economic partnership agreements (EPAs) and the development impact of EPAs heard, not just in this Parliament but giving a voice to ACP concerns throughout the world. As many of you know, Glenys is giving up at the end of this Parliament, and I think we will very much miss the work that she has done in relation to the ACP, and EPAs in particular.
I want to concentrate my remarks as rapporteur for the Cariforum EPA, which of course, at the moment, is the only full Economic Partnership Agreement. As this EPA has been signed, we cannot amend the text, we only have an opportunity to say 'yes' or 'no' to it. I believe that, if the Commission and the Commissioner are able to give us certain assurances and certain interpretations of the text, we could be in a position this week to give our assent to the Cariforum EPA.
Secondly, I would like to hear the Commissioner reassure us on the finance for EPAs. Calculations suggest that roughly EUR 580 million are available for the Cariforum countries over the existing EDF and other financial framework periods up to 2013. In my opinion - but of course I am no expert on this - this should be enough to meet the demands of the EPAs if they are properly programmed, if the money is all spent, if the Caribbean countries' priorities are met in terms of where the money should be spent. Furthermore, we have to make sure that the Member States deliver their part of the EUR 2 billion that has been promised for 'aid for trade' across the developing world. We also have to look at the post-2013 position; we cannot get any assurances from the Commission on that, because that is for Parliament and the Council, but we have to be aware that the money runs out, the commitments run out in 2013.
The first point relates to significant flexibility. This flexibility must encompass the following points. Firstly, the inclusion of a review clause, which is also flexible, so that it provides not for a five-year timeframe, but one which can be constantly re-assessed at relatively short notice. Secondly, sensitive matters should be discussed only when the country expressly wishes to do so. In particular, this refers to the Singapore topics, but naturally also to the question of how to integrate TRIPS, as well as similar issues.
In this context, Commissioner, you only really need to extend the concessions that you already made in the case of SADC to the Côte d'Ivoire. Doing so would increase the likelihood of a corresponding positive response from Parliament. We are simply very concerned, and it is a concern that has been voiced by many non-governmental organisations, that especially in the case of the Côte d'Ivoire the Commission initially appeared to show relatively little flexibility and this was the reason why the aforementioned issues were not taken into account during the transition from the provisional to the full agreement. A concession would therefore prove exceptionally helpful and would enable us to approve the agreement.
Moreover, during my discussions with the representatives of the Côte d'Ivoire I understood that they are very concerned that the technical aid will not flow rapidly enough and that here too not all of their concerns have been taken into account. As I understand they are especially interested in the Commission and the international organisations that are providing them with help giving them SME market access so that they can actually make use of the access to the European market. They are exceptionally cautious when negotiations touch on these Singapore topics, when they even discuss them, and are anxious for us to help them develop an understanding of how public goods can be used for society. In addition, they are especially interested in us providing them with help in matters associated with technical standards because for them they often represent real barriers to trade.
My final comment refers to the point concerning Parliament. As I mentioned previously, we only have the possibility of saying yes or no, and that obviously imposes relatively significant limitations on the extent to which Parliament is able to collaborate in shaping the vote. I wish to expressly remind you, and you will also find this reflected in our texts, that a possible approval of the provisional agreement does not necessarily mean that we will also automatically vote in favour of the full agreement. In fact, within the framework of the monitoring procedure, we expressly wish to be included in the continuing negotiations so that to a certain extent, in so far as it is within our power, we can follow up on the points that I have just raised.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, in this debate we are not simply discussing a package of sixteen oral questions to the Council and the Commission, eight resolutions and two reports under the codecision procedure, but also 79 developing countries, with which the EU is renewing its trade relations and mutual cooperation. Trade and cooperation are important tools in the fight against poverty, as well as for building more economically and socially stable national economies. Above all, this process involves providing support for the creation of infrastructure, for healthcare, food sovereignty, a functioning social system, education and cultural exchange.
In the past, our trade relations with the ACP countries were based on a system of non-reciprocal trade preferences, which allowed most of the products made in the ACP States duty free access to the common market. In 2000, it was agreed that a new partnership agreement would be drawn up by the end of 2007. Under this new agreement, unilateral trade preferences were to be replaced by WTO-compatible agreements, which aimed to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate poverty, as well as fostering sustainable development, regional integration, economic cooperation and good governance, helping ACP countries to develop their economic potential and gradually integrating them into the global economy. In addition to this, the production capacity of these countries was to be expanded, and measures were to be taken in order to facilitate private enterprise and investment.
For the ACP States, the abolition of customs duties results in lost earnings from these duties, and a loss of funding needed for urgent public investment in infrastructure, the social sphere, support for economic development and improvement of administrative capacity. Moreover, it means the slowing of the growth of the national economy and, therefore, continued dependence on exports from industrialised countries. This affects foodstuffs just as much as industrial goods and, ultimately, creates a vicious cycle. The increasing food prices in the ACP countries are the undeniable proof of this effect. I have often asked the following question: if 50 years of non-reciprocal trade relations have not fostered any even remotely adequate development, how could this be achieved with the mutual opening up of markets?
A further serious problem, which will be exacerbated by the proposed agreement, is the relationship between the partner regions and countries. Within the East African community, and I am personally responsible for the relevant motion for a resolution, the problem of internal tariffs may be less significant, as a customs union exists, but the trade relations between neighbouring states may become more difficult as a result of the different degrees of liberalisation. In this case, there are, of course, many problems that are linked to the country of origin regulations. There are serious fears in relation to the negotiations on comprehensive EPAs. They reflect certain conflicts within the blocked Doha development round. Many states do not think that they are in a position to deregulate their service, investment and public procurement markets and open them up to global competition. This is not even fully manageable, or even desirable, within the European Community itself. In terms of the lack of control mechanisms for financial markets, we do not need to go into greater detail here.
What financial, technical and administrative support measures are foreseen within the framework of re-establishing trade and development partnerships? Will the Commission, during the continuing negotiations, be flexible and take the needs of the partner regions into account, in particular in terms of facilitating export duties for development purposes, protecting fledgling industries, ensuring the freedom of movement of employees and special protection for the public procurement system? In addition to this, is the Commission ready to rethink its position on protecting intellectual property rights, in terms of ensuring that biological diversity and the transfer of knowledge are preserved, and that medical care at a reasonable price will be guaranteed in poorer countries? Are the Council and the Commission prepared to provide Parliament and civil society with adequate information concerning participation opportunities? Finally, is there the readiness to revise the negotiated agreement if it should turn out that certain points have a negative influence on development in the ACP States?
Let me finally make a brief, personal comment. I have now been chairman of the Committee for International Trade for two and a half years. As I am not standing for that post again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Secretariat, Mr Rodas and especially Mrs Pribaz, very, very much for their great support, and also to thank my colleagues. The collaboration was successful and I think we have achieved a great deal. It would be wonderful if we could achieve success with the EPA as well. I would like to wish all those who remain here all the best for the next parliamentary term. I am actually very hopeful that trade will begin to play a larger role in this Parliament. Thank you very much.
These countries are at risk of being the hardest hit as the global recession surges forward and the protectionist arms race looks set to intensify. I cannot, therefore, understand some of the criticism that has been expressed. Some people claim that these agreements go too far and are too comprehensive. Some critics would rather talk of lost customs revenue than of the potential for new trade. I think, on the contrary, that we should be pleased that we have achieved so much. I do not believe that there is an inherent conflict between trade and development as some speakers claim. Quite the contrary: trade leads to development, duties lead to poverty.
I was responsible for the interim agreement with Ghana. I acknowledge, first of all, that it contains a few flaws, such as the continued imposition of EU duties on rice and sugar for a transitional period, but it is, essentially, a very good agreement. It is therefore important for us to ensure that it is signed as soon as possible. The presidential election in Ghana previously presented an obstacle, but now I would like to urge the country's new President, John Atta Mills, to sign the interim agreement. I also hope that we in the EU will be sure to sign the agreement that we have negotiated. It is unacceptable for it to take so long, and it is particularly unacceptable for it to take so long due to the failure of the translation service in the Council to function adequately.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from where I stand, the agreements signed between the economic partners are vital in terms of securing trade relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific states. Cooperation is in the interest both of the European Union and of these countries. We need urgently to avoid supplying the African countries with development aid, as we have done for the last fifty or sixty years. We have to finally let these countries be free mentally too, so that they will be able to take their future in their own hands and so that they can build wealth for themselves, just as other regions of the world have done over the course of the last few decades.
Let us remember the initial positions of some Members of this Parliament in the face of increasing concern in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, in the face of demonstrations against the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), in the face of warning signals from NGOs from the North as well as the South, when we were demanding that the priority in these agreements should be development, something that seems obvious today, as the Commission is constantly repeating it. Mr Mandelson, however, at the time, scarcely dared to answer us because, for him, it was primarily a matter of stimulating trade, as if simply removing customs barriers would somehow miraculously bring about development.
People called us idealists, manipulated by the NGOs, and were offended by our demands for instruments for protection, regulation and intervention by public authorities, but what happened? It appeared that we were not being irresponsible. No, the governments of the ACP countries did not accept continuing negotiations under pressure or threats. No, the risks involved in opening up trade are not an attitude of mind, they are real and will have real and immediate consequences: state budgets will be reduced through loss of customs revenues, new industries in the agricultural sector will be weakened and the food security of their people put at risk.
I want to be completely honest, Commissioner, and I wish this to be quite clear. If you do not make a strong and precise commitment on behalf of the Commission to give us a guarantee that the EPAs will be genuinely pro-development, I will not vote for assent. Words will not be enough and nor will declarations of intent, we have heard too much of those. We want specific commitments and I would like to list them one by one. The EPAs will not be satisfactory agreements unless they promote regional integration and contribute to development in the ACP countries and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
When we call for the promotion of regional integration, that needs to be translated into practical terms. For example, in Central Africa, Cameroon has been criticised, not to say strongly condemned, by its neighbours, for having signed this interim agreement with the European Union. Out of the eight countries in the region, I note that five are Least Developed Countries, that is, countries that, automatically and fully in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation, have free access to the European market for exports without any requirements for trade concessions in return. I can quite understand their concerns when the Commission asks them to open up to 80 % of European exports.
The third point is services. In our discussions about EPAs with Cameroon, the Commission stressed time and again that our partners wanted to negotiate about services. That may be true, but, nonetheless, beware of those who would use this argument to impose liberalisation of services on all regions and all countries, and especially to justify liberalisation of public services. Commissioner, I expect a firm commitment from you that public services will remain outside the scope of the negotiations, in all regions. We know that the loss of customs revenue will cause a reduction in the budgets of our partners. If revenues are reduced, the first sectors to suffer will be sectors such as education, health or research. It would, therefore, be unacceptable for the ACP governments in this context to lose control of their public services and I call upon the Commissioner to give us her firm assurance on these issues.
The last point is that we know that upgrading the economies of ACP States will require a huge financial commitment from the European Union both to protect infant industries from the negative effects of liberalisation and to develop the competitiveness of our partners' economies. Unfortunately, contrary to the repeated recommendations of our political group, it is the European Development Fund that is to be used as the primary source of funding for the EPAs. We know that in the past the Commission has not been outstanding in the way it makes use of these funds, and I must, therefore, stress how important it is for these funds to be used quickly and according to the priorities of our partners.
The whole debate that we are having this evening was not triggered by any decision of the European Commission or the European Union that we wanted a new trade relationship with the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific, but by a decision - a decade or more or so now - of the World Trade Organisation that we were unfairly discriminating in favour of some developing countries at the expense of others. Some people have said that this should be just about development - I am very much in favour of that - but we have to bear in mind that one of the underlying requirements is that it is actually about making our agreements with these countries WTO-compatible. So we have to do that; that it is the first thing.
On top of WTO compatibility, we must do whatever we can to try and improve the situation of these various regional blocks and to try and deal with the particular situations that actually face them. With respect to the Pacific, for which I am the rapporteur, we have a collection of 14 - plus one if you include East Timor - very small nation-states. One, in fact, is the smallest country in the world, with a population that is exactly one million times less than that of China - Nauru. But even the biggest ones are actually comparatively small, and we need to take that into account in what requirements and demands we put on them. We need to make sure that there are adequate transition periods for small and medium-sized enterprises because, quite frankly, apart from some mining enterprises in Papua New Guinea, they are all small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to do what we can about regional trade and in particular to take into account the special relationship that countries of the Pacific have with Australia and with New Zealand.
Only two of the 14 have actually signed up for the Interim Agreement. However, I know from my visit to Port Moresby at the last ACP meeting that there are other Pacific countries that would like to sign a final agreement provided it meets their requirements, which is why, in my case, I am actually in favour of the interim agreement. That is the message I got, both from the governments of Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Not that they are entirely happy - there are issues that they would like to renegotiate - but they see the answer as being signing up and accepting an interim agreement which would lead towards a final agreement which will be more development friendly and will enable more of the Pacific countries to actually engage.
We also need to look at a number of specific issues that apply in particular in Papua New Guinea and Fiji and elsewhere in the Pacific, but may apply to some other of these agreements. We need to look at intellectual property right negotiations that cover not only Western technological artefacts but traditional knowledge; we need to make sure that there is a transparency of government procurement with openness to European contracts triggered at a point appropriate to the needs of the Pacific nation-states; we need to look in the case of the Pacific particularly at working visas to be made available in the European Union to Pacific island nationals for periods of at least 24 months for them to be able to work - not in the higher professions but probably working as carers and in similar occupations.
The last point I would like to make in relation to ESA, apart from to endorse the report of Mr Caspary - with some of the amendments which have been tabled - is to mention the situation of the Chagos Archipelago. It is in there because I tabled an amendment, which was accepted. Normally in these kinds of agreements we actually consult with neighbouring countries and neighbouring territories. The Chagos Archipelago is in the middle of part of this region: Seychelles-Mauritius-Madagascar. These people are currently refugees in Seychelles, and I hope that we will consult with them between now and any final agreement being made as to what the impact might be on them and on their territory should they get the right to return.
EPAs have always been a high priority for development ministries at their meetings within the framework of the Council for General Affairs and External Relations. In recent years almost all of these meetings have included discussions with the Commission on the implementation of the Council mandate concerning EPAs, which have often resulted in the adoption of conclusions. When the Czech Presidency presented its programme to this Parliament in January, we said that this was a key period and we promised to put maximum efforts into ensuring further progress. We took the opportunity to respond to many different questions and we have devoted considerable efforts to a range of topics. We continue to regard cooperation and constructive discussion between the institutions as the best way to create and develop the right policies.
Under these circumstances we must exploit every opportunity within the context of our response to the global economic crisis to make trade the driving force for sustainable development. The EPAs serve this end. Through gradual regional integration they provide an opportunity for regional trade and the expansion of duty-free and quota-free access to our extensive market, enabling a higher volume of trade with the EU. The EPAs thus operate in a way which conforms to WTO rules. This factor constitutes an important legal aspect distinguishing the EPAs from the previous commercial preferences which were implemented under the Cotonou Convention and which were detrimental to trade between the ACP countries and the EU and caused considerable uncertainty.
A series of binding reports have been published in recent months describing how the economic crisis may block progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in many regions. We should be very uneasy about this. The EPAs make use of all the flexibility allowed under WTO rules in order to assist development. They ensure for our partners from ACP countries the immediate and asymmetric opening up of markets with long transitional periods, exemptions and regular monitoring, and they also set out commitments to political reforms. The EU has at the same time undertaken that it will not leave its partners to face this challenge on their own. For the operation of these agreements we are also providing specially adapted financial support.
I am delighted that there has recently been a revival of interest in greater dialogue over EPAs on the part of both EU and ACP countries. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Ashton for her efforts and for the importance she has attached to listening to the views of our partners from the ACP countries. Following the outline of her approach on EPAs to Parliament in October last year and to the Council in November, there was a strengthening of contacts with our political counterparts in the various ACP regions. Significant progress is now being made in negotiations with various regions. Each region has its own characteristics and is proceeding at its own rate. In the months ahead, we should get a clearer picture based on all of these negotiations.
I believe that the European Parliament will support the EPAs with the Cariforum States and the interim EPA with Côte d'Ivoire. This will send an encouraging signal to all ACP countries. It will be proof for them that patience in negotiations brings results that are acceptable and beneficial to both sides. It will also show that the ACP-EU partnership is capable of reacting to new challenges, whether of a legal, economic or political nature. At this time of unease every new international agreement represents a stronger partnership and a new hope for the future. The signing of the agreements would send a worthwhile political message which will perhaps contribute something to the forthcoming meeting of the two joint bodies of the ACP-EU: the Joint Parliamentary Assembly taking place at the beginning of April in Prague and the Joint Council of Ministers at the end of May in Brussels.
The EU must continue to support its partners, and this means not only the Cariforum region which has shown the way to others by signing the first comprehensive EPA, but also those countries and regions that have taken the first steps and must be encouraged to go further. Among these is Côte d'Ivoire, whose interim EPA also awaits the approval of this Parliament. Further EPAs are being prepared. The Commission is working hard to create conditions for partner countries which will enable them to come together and to plot a course towards comprehensive regional agreements. The Council always emphasises to the Commission and the partners that these agreements are a development instrument and that the advantages for development can be exploited to the full only through comprehensive regional agreements.
The overall political and economic context within which Parliament has been invited to approve the Cariforum EPAs and the interim EPA with Côte d'Ivoire is important, but Parliament has nevertheless asked the Council and the Commission for a number of concrete explanations. This step is an essential and legitimate part of the process and I am trying to make the fullest possible response to questions that fall within my area of responsibility. I am aware that other questions have been raised which Commissioner Ashton is ready to answer. I would like to begin by addressing some of the topics that have been mentioned.
One of the issues you raised concerned the question of whether, when and to what extent reviews would be conducted into EPAs with Cariforum States. Both the Council and the ACP group fully share the concerns relating to this question. I can confirm that comprehensive reviews of EPAs will be conducted no later than five years from the date on which they were signed, which was in October last year. The reviews will of course be supplementary to the routine monitoring of the fulfilment of these agreements, as set out in Article 5. These reviews are mandatory under the terms of the agreements and they are one of the tasks of the joint bodies, including the parliamentary and advisory committees. Impact assessments will be carried out within the framework of the reviews and these will include the costs and consequences of operating the agreements. If an EPA is amended in any way or if there are changes to the way they are implemented the involvement of the parliaments is guaranteed, either under the laws of the signatories to the EPA or within the framework of the parliamentary committees set up on the basis of the EPA.
The second question that Parliament is interested in concerns the accompanying financial measures requested by the ACP regions and especially our undertakings to support trade. As you are aware, in October 2007, both the European Community and its Member States committed to increase assistance in the area of trade to EUR 1 billion by 2010 within the framework of the EU Strategy on trade assistance. Almost 50 % of this increased amount will be available for needs prioritised by the ACP countries themselves, including needs arising from the operation of the EPAs. All Member State commitments to support trade are supplementary to assistance from the European Development Fund and all our commitments are firm.
Article 4 of the EPA clearly states that in its implementation it will take proper account of the integration processes in the Cariforum States, including the CARICOM single market and economic space. Special attention will be paid to strengthening the regional integration programmes and ensuring a sustainable future for them. During negotiations the Cariforum States have already ensured that all of the obligations arising from the EPAs would be fully compatible with the regional obligations adopted by the Caribbean states within the framework of their relevant regional integration programmes.
However, the compatibility of the EPA with the regional integration processes is also important for all of the other regions which are at present negotiating comprehensive EPAs. As an example we might mention here the comprehensive EPA intended for the West African economies. A comprehensive regional EPA would strengthen regional integration, boost competitiveness and contribute to the development of the region. The negotiation process has itself already contributed towards increased efforts on regional integration, since the creation of a joint external tariff scale for the Economic Community of West African States is considered an essential precondition for concluding EPA negotiations. It is also possible to say the same about other regions, with due reference to their specific needs and integration processes.
Regional integration will undoubtedly be strengthened as soon as all regions sign comprehensive agreements adapted to their specific requirements. Parliament has repeatedly called for a flexible approach in the transition from interim to the comprehensive agreements. In this context I can only confirm that the Council shares the same view and emphasises the need for a flexible approach. When several difficult questions remained unresolved in the negotiations we called on the Commission in May last year to exploit all of the flexibility and asymmetry compatible with WTO rules to take account of the varying needs and different levels of development of the ACP countries and regions. In addition to these we also took other steps. The Council declared that ACP countries and regions, if they so wished, could depart where necessary from the provisions agreed by other countries or regions during EPA negotiations.
At this moment, in March 2009, when we are experiencing the worst economic earth-tremors for a generation, I would like to emphasise how important it is for us all to appreciate successful results in the area of politics. At a time of declining trade and with increasingly protectionist measures being adopted in this area, at a time of threat that the progress achieved in fulfilling Millennium Development Goals will be lost in some regions, the approval of the European Parliament for the EPA with the Cariforum States and the interim EPA with the Côte d'Ivoire will provide a positive signal in support of regional integration and in support of trade that will assist development. We must respond to the current crisis by establishing further partnerships and not by restricting them. The European Parliament's confirmation of the EPA with the Cariforum States will also bring hope and encouragement to other regions whose negotiations are at an advanced stage and who also need the sense of trust and strong partnership which these agreements can provide.
Before I say anything else, I would like to make one thing completely clear: I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in negotiating agreements with ACP countries that could make these countries poorer. I know that is an obvious statement, but my experience suggests that it is one that I should firmly place on the record and I cannot assume has already been widely understood. When honourable Members come to vote later on, I hope it will be on the basis of the discussion that we have had today and the arguments that have been set out here, rather than on any preconceived ideas you may have.
I believe that today's plenary session is an important step forward on economic partnership agreements (EPAs). You will be asked for your assent on the full EPA in the Caribbean and the interim EPA with Côte d'Ivoire. You have tabled no less than eight sets of draft resolutions and oral questions reflecting, in my view, the strength of parliamentary involvement and opinion on EPAs. I want to pay tribute, and place on record that tribute, to the huge effort that the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Development have put into the debate on this issue.
Over the months, I have listened carefully to the views expressed, and my aim is to set out the case for EPAs and to dispel the myths around them so that every Member is able to cast an informed vote when the time comes. I believe that what we have before us are good agreements that support economic development and integration in the ACP and provide stability in these economically turbulent times. They are partnership agreements founded on the shared goal of development that make trade the servant of this objective and not the reverse. Most of all, they are agreements that provide the opportunity for ACP States to lift their citizens out of poverty through the dignity of their own labour and the genius of their own ideas.
There is a perception that in EPAs the European Union is breaking with the past and unilaterally trying to redefine the EU-ACP partnership. It is true, of course, that EPAs are different from the Lomé and Cotonou Conventions that embodied the Union's relations with the ACP for 30 years, but the unilateral preferences that characterise those conventions became open to challenge in the World Trade Organisation by other developing countries. The dilemma that we faced was how to safeguard the development requirements of the ACP while respecting international rules and, I would add, moral obligations.
The answer was twofold: 'Everything But Arms' for the least-developed countries, and economic partnership agreements for the developing countries in the ACP. The common theme that stretches all the way back to the first Lomé Convention was trade. Trade has always been the defining factor of EU-ACP relations, and what was once confined to unilateral trade preferences for commodities and raw materials in the early days of Lomé has now been replaced by more diversified trade in manufactured goods, services and ideas in the 21st century.
EPAs offer the ACP the best ever access to EU markets and continue our commitment to provide opportunities for economic development. Regional integration within and between ACP markets has also been a key objective of this process and a subject that has attracted - not surprisingly - a lot of attention in oral questions. Our global economy means that size has become more important, a lesson that we have learnt in the European Union. By simplifying trade rules and replacing the complex maze of bilateral agreements with a small number of region-to-region trade relationships, the ACP can create bigger regional markets that are more attractive to the investment which developing markets need in order to create jobs and growth.
I firmly believe these partnerships will only succeed if they are anchored in an enduring partnership based on trust and mutual respect. The key test of this partnership is whether we and our ACP partners have a shared vision of the future. In southern Africa, I see a region that took conflict about EPAs and turned it into dialogue, and where we have now settled major issues of concern like export taxes, infant industry protection and food security. In the Caribbean, I see a region that has set down clearly its own ambitions for an innovation-based economy. In West Africa, I see an emerging regional market access position many thought impossible, and in East Africa I see an emerging customs union that did not exist when negotiations started and is now building an EPA around their own integration plans. This looks and feels to me like the beginnings of successful partnership.
Going forward, my vision for the negotiations of full EPAs is one where each negotiation reflects and respects the regional specificity of the parties to that agreement - a flexible process. This means both looking at content - because the EPA has to work for its signatories - but also the pace of negotiations. It also means that EPAs should be dynamic and not static, able to react to future events and to account for different regional interests and needs. In this process, the Commission will, indeed, continue to inform and involve the European Parliament in a transparent way.
While we should be ambitious, there must also be no imposed dialogue, which is why issues like government procurement have already been removed from some negotiations, and Singapore issues only included when they are welcomed and wanted by the countries concerned. We will also take the time and provide the support to build up regional and national regulation as a prerequisite for further negotiation, and 'aid for trade' and technical assistance will be absolutely key in that regard. I can guarantee there will be no opening of public services, no pressure for privatisation. The explicit right of the ACP to regulate their own markets will be recognised and there will be no limitation of access to essential medicines or collecting seed. In fact, we would rather seek to strengthen than limit ACP rights and capacity in these areas.
All of this is overlaid by our commitment that ACP regions can draw on provisions agreed in other EPAs, so that each region can move ahead secure in the knowledge it will not be disadvantaged. So, Côte d'Ivoire can directly ask for and have anything of relevance to it that is part of the SADC negotiations and discussions or those for anywhere else. This is a key aspect of the flexibility that you asked me to provide and of allowing EPAs to replace an all-ACP trade regime with one that matches regional solutions to regional needs without undermining ACP solidarity.
To return to where I began, Parliament has an historic opportunity today to give its assent to the first examples of a new generation of agreements that safeguard our special relationship with the ACP; agreements based on genuine partnership, not paternalism; that harness trade as the motor of development; that promote and encourage the regional integration that will help ACP countries flourish in a globalised world; that are flexible in terms of content, respectful of tradition, and are the latest manifestation of this long-standing trade relationship built on a respect for sovereign states. In short, they are the future and I hope, on that basis, Members will give their assent.
The assent procedure for Cariforum States and Côte d'Ivoire is crucial to realising the potential of these reforms. Approval of these signed agreements will allow for a formal negotiation procedure to progress. This will provide a level of legality essential for protecting ACP markets and securing a more stable environment. With regard to the resolutions on Cariforum - the only full Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) - I call upon Members to support the original text of the Committee on International Trade. It provides for a more balanced trade and development approach and is intended to support a number of the compromises proposed by the rapporteur. I believe these resolutions highlight both the opportunities and challenges facing the negotiating parties in a key step to ensuring parliamentary oversight and approving of the relations with ACP.
In order to ensure successful implementation of these agreements, it is vital for the parliaments to control the process by means of their parliamentary scrutiny. It is only if the parliaments are able to verify whether the new system of regulations can achieve what it was designed to do, that the Economic Partnership Agreements can operate as a driving force for development. It is only when the parliaments take on this supervisory function that we can ensure that financial aid reaches the areas where it is needed. This applies to the national parliaments of the Caribbean as much as it does to the European Parliament.
In all of the resolutions before us concerning the Economic Partnership Agreements, there are paragraphs which address the issue of parliamentary control. However, these references are not consistent. The text contained in the SADC-EPA Resolution presents a good compromise. It ensures that the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Development, as well as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee are involved in the process. As I view this compromise as a success, I have, together with my colleague Mr Sturdy, tabled a number of amendments, which aim to standardise these paragraphs in all of the EPA Resolutions. I would very much like your support for this initiative.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on the Interim EPA with Côte d'Ivoire, I would like to thank our colleague Erika Mann for having taking into consideration some of the concerns raised in that committee, such as the urgent need for a democratically-elected government in Côte d'Ivoire and the necessity for that country to receive an appropriate share of EU trade-related assistance.
Secondly, on the trade front, as you have pointed out, we have historic ties. For a long time there has been trade between North and South, but look at how it takes place. We plunder everything there is and take all the riches. Of course, we sell the coltan that our companies have extracted from Kivu to sell in the North, but look at the disastrous consequences for the people of the South, and the unequal sharing, to say the least, that we see there.
Aside from that, you add a development policy that we have been employing for 40 years saying that we Europeans are the world's biggest sponsor, but it is a policy that is failing now and has to be reviewed. Most of the poorest countries in the world are doing badly, just as badly as 40 years ago, if not worse. That, therefore, is the reason for our misgivings and our questioning. What guarantees do we have with regard to this? I am not going to repeat what Mr Arif has said but I join him in saying that we would like to have a statement from you, on behalf of the Commission, on a list of points that he has clearly set out, and I should like to finish by speaking about national parliaments.
We have been asked, as Members of the European Parliament, to make a decision about the Economic Partnership Agreements, the consequences of which, if they are badly negotiated, will be tragic for the people of the South, but not for us. No European citizen will be worse off if the Economic Partnership Agreements are a failure. On the other hand, there could be citizens in the South who are going to be even worse off. I shall finish by saying to you quite simply, Commissioner, that we would like the national parliaments of the partner countries to have their say, since they represent the people of the South in this matter, and not only us.
Apart from anything else, we must consider that the system we are going to replace, first the Lomé Convention and then the arrangement based on the Cotonou Agreements, in no way achieved the desired results. No one can claim that the Cotonou system was entirely satisfactory. If it had been, the figures - the volume of EU trade with those countries - would be far higher than they are today. Therefore we should not claim, either, that we are going to replace something that has yielded results, because that is not the case.
For all these reasons, these Economic Partnership Agreements should be seen as a great opportunity, particularly for all those of us who believe that the development and growth of these countries cannot depend solely on external aid. Clearly, I refer especially to those countries that are party to these agreements but are not among the least-developed countries. In this regard the concept of ownership, of taking control of one's own destiny and not depending exclusively on external aid, lies politically - and I may say philosophically - behind these partnership agreements.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, this debate is important because we are, of course, about to take a long break in our work on account of the elections. We therefore need to ensure that the Directorate General for Trade takes note of our sustained criticism of the content of the Economic Partnership Agreements, particularly as the Directorate will soon sign these agreements. In this regard, we need to emphasise the importance of the agreements returning to Parliament to obtain our approval.
I therefore have a couple of specific comments relating to the two agreements that Parliament is to commit to on Wednesday, and I will explain why the Group of the Greens does not support them. As regards the agreement with Cariforum, detailed analyses by the Overseas Development Institute show that the Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean countries is probably the least development-friendly of all of the agreements that have been negotiated so far. It will be a poor model for when other regional agreements are to be negotiated, especially when it comes to the aspect of development. Of course, it is not up to us to decide whether our concern is justified when the governments of the Cariforum states are themselves in favour of these agreements, but it would be perfectly in order for the parliaments of the individual countries affected to be permitted to vote on the agreements before the European Parliament has given its approval.
However, our concerns regarding the agreement with Cariforum, which we are raising here in the EU, are justified in any case. At the current time, when there is a great need for better control of the movement of money on the financial markets, we find it totally unacceptable that the Cariforum agreements allow full liberalisation of financial services with the eight tax havens that currently form part of Cariforum. If you do not believe me, take a look at your documents before you vote on Wednesday. In these documents you can read about the free movement of financial services sold over the counter, in other words what are referred to as 'unregistered speculative derivatives'. You can also read about the right to establish funds for individual inhabitants. This all comes into the EU via our own tax havens, for example Malta and Cyprus. This can happen as long as there is no monitoring or regulation across the EU, and therefore it is simply not the right time to protect these structures, which share a large part of the responsibility for the collapse of our economies.
This agreement was an opportunity to reduce the impact of certain so-called structural handicaps, such as remoteness, for example, in favour of the closeness between our islands. Why have we dispensed with negotiating a specific interregional market between the outermost regions of the European Union and Cariforum? At a time when the European Commission is concerned about addressing the underdevelopment of the Caribbean countries and establishing EPAs with this group for the purpose of opening up markets and regional integration, the outermost region of the Caribbean is taken into account only to become a part of the Cariforum open market and it remains stuck in the same market principles as were negotiated for the whole of the European Union. These principles can put us at a disadvantage.
Mr President, we all know that there have been many criticisms of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). I share some of those criticisms. I agree that EPAs should not be a method for aggressively opening up markets for EU companies only: they should also be of benefit to entrepreneurs and consumers in poor countries. I share Erika Mann's concern over the 'one size fits all' approach to EPAs, which does not take account of the differences between regions and between countries within regions. I welcome the fact that we have actually signed interim agreements only with those countries that have shown an interest in signing such agreements.
I was also concerned at the view expressed by a Commission official, at a meeting of the Committee on International Trade (INTA) a few months ago, that EPAs were more than just about trade and development and that they were about regional political integration as well. I believe, like many of my colleagues in this Parliament, that this decision should be left to the countries themselves, especially those which are democracies that do not want to sit in a regional assembly with dictatorships from the same region.
Despite these concerns, we should welcome the assent of the INTA Committee for these EPAs. For a while I was concerned about some of the anti-trade rhetoric I heard from the Socialists, when they voted against or abstained in committee. EPAs may not be perfect but many of my friends and family in poorer countries are fed up at the lack of access to goods and services and at being forced to rely on state-run monopolies or companies with links to corrupt politicians. That the Socialists wanted to keep it that way is also a matter of concern. Let us not forget that import taxes often mean poor citizens having to pay more for imported food and medicines.
The policy of concluding separate deals with separate countries has led to serious inconsistencies, and I can confirm to those who do not know the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), and who do not have as much contact with parliamentarians in the ACP as I and others in this room have, that it has created really very difficult situations and severely damaged the cohesion that I perceived amongst the ACP in the past. I know that just a few weeks ago the new President of Ghana wrote a letter on behalf of the entire ACP group to the EU Presidency, and he claimed that the EPA process continued to threaten the very existence of some of the regional integration groupings. That is a recent comment by a new president.
Finally, I was glad the Commissioner mentioned services, because I am concerned about the opening-up of banking in particular. Western countries failed to regulate properly the big international banks operating on their own territories, so you have to ask whether it is really wise to open up the banking sector in countries where there is much less of a regulatory regime in place, and when the WTO rules do not require such a move. Opening up the banking sector may help big companies, but it can drive local banks to join the pursuit of high-value customers and ignore small businesses, leaving them with even less access to credit than before.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kohout, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Ford, for the quality of his report and his sense of compromise. We were able to work on this issue in Papua New Guinea during the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, and of the European Union. I saw him working with members of national parliaments and I am, therefore, happy about that.
This agreement is an opportunity to give new impetus to trade relations and guarantees access to the European market with exemption from customs duties and without quotas for most goods. I should like to insist on the aid of EUR 2 billion to be provided by 2010, and in conclusion, I should like to add that it is very important that there should be no infringement, on the economic level also, of patent rights or of intellectual property rights which affect trade. With regard to human rights, I am amazed that we have dealings with Papua New Guinea when this country still penalises sexual orientations. Finally, on the political front, it is important for us to have an alliance with the ACP States within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.
The issue of bananas was raised. Baroness Ashton, you said there will be duty-free and quota-free access, which is fine, but the issue is that the agreements that have been signed with Central America, and subsequently with Mercosur and the Andean Pact countries, will reduce the tariffs for them, and nothing we do is going to make it possible for banana producers in the ACP to remain competitive. That is a critical issue, and the agreements have been reached before the ink has even dried on the CARIFORUM Agreement.
As regards Côte d'Ivoire, we would like very clear assurances. It is a country which has experienced a great deal of turmoil, uncertainty and instability over many years, and it is very important that we give assent, but also that we have assurances that you will indicate, in the form of a letter to the negotiators in Côte d'Ivoire and to the Côte d'Ivoire Government, that we remain committed to negotiating in good faith for a decent outcome for the people of that country.
I would like to stress that the Council is very aware of flexibility at two important levels. The first of these is flexibility in the sense of fully exploiting the options for asymmetric arrangements, timetables and protective measures within World Trade Organisation rules. I therefore cannot agree either with the opinion or with the sweeping conclusion that 40 years of assistance to developing countries has been a catastrophe. I believe that the situation would have been much worse without aid from the EU and other countries. At the same time I think that the rules we have allow such a degree of flexibility that every one of these countries - and in this I have faith in the Commission and the Commissioner - should be capable of finding a solution which matches their needs and interests.
The second kind of flexibility is the one that we are offering in the transition from the interim provisions of EPAs to full regional agreements in the interests of supporting regional cooperation. The second point I would like to respond to from the debate concerns the question of the development dimension of EPAs. There is no doubt in my mind that the agreements are not conventional trade agreements as they have an intrinsically strong development dimension. The agreements establish lengthy interim arrangements of up to 25 years and they also include exemptions - up to 20% of goods coming from ACP countries can be exempted from liberalisation. The agreements make provision for monitoring and reviews that will involve Parliament. Their implementation will be supported by the Aid for Trade financial package. I consider all of this to be proof of the developmental nature of these agreements.
At the same time I would like to say on behalf of the Czech Presidency and the Council that we will be closely monitoring the progress of negotiations over EPAs and I would like to express my support for the Commission and also Commissioner Ashton for the efforts she has made to date to fulfil the mandate that the Council gave her. During the course of the Czech Presidency we will be focusing on EPAs at the May meeting of the Council for General Affairs and External Relations within the format of ministers for development cooperation. If agreement is reached between us and our partner-ministers from the ACP countries then this issue will also be on the discussion agenda for the joint meeting of the ACP and EU Council of Ministers in May. During the Czech Presidency, the Council also welcomes the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Prague at the beginning of April, just a few days from now. I am certain that EPAs will form one of the main topics of discussion and that the discussions will prove highly important precisely because they are taking place in a parliamentary context.
I look forward with personal interest to your vote tomorrow. In my view this is a key moment in the development of EPAs. As we have heard, negotiations are still continuing in many regions, but in the Caribbean region important and good results have already been achieved. As far as Côte d'Ivoire is concerned, we have reached a key point in respect of further progress. Many countries await the approval of the European Parliament and with it the culmination of several years of difficult negotiations and I firmly believe that Parliament will give a positive signal to the world which is much needed at this point in time. I believe and I am sure, even in the current crisis that has been referred to several times here, that this is an instrument that will really help, even during this great uncertainty that we all feel. We all know that it will help the development of these countries.
Mr Guardans Cambó, Mr Hutchinson and Ms Hall, you all in different ways talked about the past and our need to do better. I agree with that. I may not completely agree with the analysis, but I do agree that this is an opportunity to look forward, and part of that is about looking forward to the involvement not only of this Parliament but also of parliaments across the ACP. Of course, it is up to individual nations how they involve their own parliaments. We have to be very careful - and I know honourable Members would want me to be - in not imposing what I think upon any other country. Let me say to Mrs Kinnock, that I look forward to the meeting with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA).
Mr Sturdy and Mr Martin, 'most favoured nation' is, as has been said, designed to capture in a sense those large countries that have not supported the process we have been involved in. It is not about damaging South-South trade or damaging in any way, shape or form the opportunities and the sovereignty of those countries that wish to open up trade. That is why we have a ceiling on the amount of world trade that a country must be involved in before this particular provision kicks in. I have to say we are always looking for any flexibility we might have within that too.
Mr Van Hecke, Ms Mann and Mrs Kinnock: what one gets, the other gets. Let me be absolutely clear: I am happy to write to anybody anywhere, but certainly to Côte d'Ivoire to say that the flexibilities that we have been in discussion with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will apply to them because there are one or two things only specific to that region that they would not want, but those that they wish to have they can have. I am very happy to put that in writing anywhere, any time to anyone. So please just tell me what you want me to do.
I was delighted that the Commissioner said she believed that regulation had to be in place prior to any liberalisation and opening-up of financial services. For some of us in this Chamber, that is also extremely important. She indicated - as we already knew, but it was important to have it on record - that nothing in these agreements forces privatisation of services in any of the Caribbean countries and that there is no expectation, through this agreement, that privatisation of public services will take place. I was pleased that she also made commitments on most-favoured-nation status.
Let me turn to a separate issue, which is the resolution. A couple of my Conservative EPP colleagues have made comments about this. For the Socialists, there are still red lines in terms of the current state of the resolution, which is different from the assent vote. Actually, all the things that the Council and Commission have committed themselves to are our red lines. So if the House is supporting the Council and Commission, I see no reason why it should not support our compromises and compromise text and get those into the Parliament resolution.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Council. What you have agreed on today is to give to Côte d'Ivoire what Parliament has been requesting for quite a time and I think the country will be more than happy. Commissioner, please could you make sure that you will send someone - or go yourself - to Côte d'Ivoire as soon as possible to give this very positive message and confirm this by letter as early as possible? This is an agreement which really fulfils what we are asking for.
I would like to comment on a few things which you have not really dealt with in detail. We would love to see monitoring. I know that this is complicated and that we will need the Council's help. We would like to see monitoring between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission taking place during the phase from interim to full agreement. That is the only way we can understand what you are going to negotiate. Otherwise, you will just send us a draft at the end of that period which we will have to agree or disagree with. That is something we do not want to see.
My final thanks go to two colleagues, firstly to Glenys Kinnock, because she was more than helpful and I am more than pleased to hear that she recommends assent on the case of Côte d'Ivoire. I know how complicated it is and I am very grateful that she is helping me in this matter. I would also like to thank my colleague Syed Kamall because he also helped as much as he could regarding the resolution. I know that sometimes it is against his beliefs with regard to trade. He is for open trade so it is not easy for him to come to an agreement. That is why I am pleased to thank both colleagues and give my thanks again to the Commission and to the Council.
It is, of course, with great satisfaction that I note the number of positive elements underlined by this report and the progress that has been made during the course of a year, which is relatively short for such a vast and, above all, politically ambitious exercise. To mention just one of these, we have this afternoon had a meeting between Parliament's ad hoc delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament of the African Union and the Pan-African Parliament of the African Union's ad hoc committee for relations with the European Parliament on the role of parliaments in implementing and monitoring Africa-EU strategy.
Rather than elaborating on the positive aspects of the Martens Report, I would like instead to touch on three key points that the report highlights for improving the EU-African Union partnership. The first point is on the role of parliaments. You know how much of a believer I am in the role of the parliaments, both as actors and as scrutineers of the democratic process. It is in this twin capacity that the European and Pan-African parliaments are invited to take part in the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership.
Moreover, the results and conclusions of this analysis were discussed with the government of the partner country during the programming dialogue. On the basis of this, the government was encouraged to explain its own reform plan or, if need be, complete it or go into more detail; to demonstrate the relevance, ambition and credibility of these reforms on the basis of three evaluation criteria, which then allowed the level of financial incentive for each country to be determined. In this context, particular attention was given to countries which are committed to the African Peer Review Mechanism and which have completed the review, showing their desire to continue along these lines. This exercise threw into stark relief the very different situations of each country; the respective needs for reform as well as the different capacities for drawing up and proposing a governance plan. Flexibility and pragmatism have therefore been necessary when apportioning the governance incentive fund. In January 2009, the Commission published an interim report on the incentive fund process and sent it to all the institutions of the European Union, for whatever purpose it may serve.
We are all aware of the criticism in our own countries, where people wonder whether it really makes sense to continue investing money in Africa, especially in these times of economic crisis. I would like to emphasise once again how important our efforts continue to be for the development of Africa, and that applies to both continents. Commissioner Michel was spot on when he said, in a meeting in this regard just a short while ago that the more poverty there is, the more instability there is. This is also important from the point of view of demographic trends. Before long, Africa will account for 20% of the world's population, while Europe will account for just 5%. We have common problems, we face common challenges. When people lack opportunities in Africa, it is only natural that they will seek them in Europe. Africa deserves our support, and not only for that reason.
Today, we are discussing the implementation of the agreed strategy and we have an action plan. We must continue to act together in order to realise the strategy and the action plan. I am pleased with the results that have been achieved so far in relation to the partnerships. In my previous reports I have always expressed concern about the lack of a clear specific role for the parliaments when it comes to the implementation of a joint strategy. In 2007, the Pan-African Parliament and the European Parliament issued a joint statement which actually quite pithily sums up what is involved. I will now read it in English.
'As institutions representing the peoples' will, our parliaments must see to it that their needs are satisfied, their concerns heard by decision-makers, and that their wishes are reflected in the policies proposed by the institutions that govern them. Our parliaments have an essential part to play in shaping the debate on the joint priorities for the future of our continents; they reflect the various currents of opinion in our societies, and are therefore the place where the debate must be conducted, and where differing views can be reconciled and compromises sought.'
(NL) I am therefore pleased that, at this meeting, we agreed what the role of the parliaments would be. It is also thanks to Mr Gahler, our colleagues in the Pan-African Parliament and all those involved that an agreement has been reached on the role of the parliaments. It is about participation in the group of experts in connection with the eight partnerships and the coordinating task force. The parliaments are to give their input in the annual progress reports and the presidents of the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament are to be invited to give their visions at the Africa summits. That is an important detail.
One of the reasons for the great importance of development policy is the fact that it has become an instrument of historically-oriented policy. In this context, the fundamental aim of cooperation on development issues is to counteract past processes and mechanisms. Jomo Kenyatta, the father of Kenyan independence, described this in a vivid, albeit simplified, manner. I know that the Commissioner is familiar with this famous quotation. Mr Kenyatta once said: 'When the missionaries arrived, the Africans had the land and the missionaries had the Bible. They taught us how to pray with our eyes closed. When we opened them, they had the land and we had the Bible.'
Historically-oriented policy is not, however, the only reason for Europe's involvement in development-related problems. There are also more pragmatic reasons. Africa remains the poorest continent in the world. Nevertheless, for the first time in 30 years, it is experiencing a period of economic growth. In any case, we may add, this economic growth is higher than in Europe. There are, of course, African countries which, as a result of the work of inept governments, have indeed managed to destroy their own economies. Generally speaking, we can state that Africa is a continent with untapped potential. I am pleased that the EU is helping to revive and activate this potential.
That is why one of the aims of the strategy is to ensure broader dialogue and cooperation, in fields other than those typically related to development issues. The strategy covers a wide range of policies, including security, energy and climate change. It is worrying, however, that little progress has been made in most of these areas. We must also admit that certain EU Member States have not been as committed to the partnership with Africa as others have. I am convinced that the second year of partnership will be better and that we will be able to achieve our goals more rapidly.
Down there, there is a shortage of everything. There is a shortage of managers, doctors, teachers and technicians. Here, there is talk of managed immigration, yet we still have not taken the measures necessary to allow diasporas, for example, to put themselves at the service of their states. Down there, they do not even manage to feed their populations. Here, we are renewing the export subsidies on our agricultural products and promoting biofuels, which leads to huge monocultures down there.
Down there, everything continues to fall apart, destitution spreads, disease kills and water is short. Here, we talk a lot, we make promises, we debate and we vote on resolutions; but what is happening in practical terms for the people of Africa? I think - as do you for that matter, and I know that you are firmly convinced of this - that it is time to bring together the parliaments of these countries, and thus to bring together their peoples. I believe that no process between the European Union and Africa will succeed as long as we remain at the level of politicians and technicians. The peoples of Africa must be brought together and it is through their parliaments that we must do it.
I am delighted to hear that there is a will to develop this special relationship at parliamentary level. However, I have my doubts, Commissioner, because just before this debate we had a long debate with your colleague Mrs Ashton about Economic Partnership Agreements. Bizarrely, it is almost impossible to achieve the involvement of the parliaments of partner countries in those agreements. We are not managing to convince part of this House, but also the Commission, that it would really be necessary for their parliaments to have their say first, before asking us - the European Parliament - our opinion on issues that will directly affect the lives of people down there. That being the case, I hope that things will change in this regard.
I find that the Member States ought to revise their current assistance to target countries, as the 2008 Millennium Development Goals Progress Chart indicates that Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region lagging seriously behind the progress expected. I would like to use this opportunity to encourage Member States to increase their contribution to Sub-Saharan Africa, which is the least developed region in the world. Also, target countries are not always too receptive towards the conditional nature of EU assistance. We should continue with the efforts to involve those countries more intimately.
The positive impact of the African Union on the economic situation is so small that, in practice, it is merely a sham organisation, with no influence in terms of solving everyday problems. It is an organisation of politicians, who use it to participate in global political life. Africa is a continent with rich natural resources, which are used by the whole world. However, this has had no positive impact on the living standards of the population or in terms of reducing poverty. Various organisations are trying to tackle the problem of poverty, but progress is barely noticeable. The rapporteur, Mrs Martens, has clearly stated this fact.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Martens, for this solid report. It is good that Parliament not only welcomes the announcement of a partnership, but also really does monitor the tangible results. That is what Africa needs: The foundations for a successful partnership with Africa require good governance and human rights. This is essential in a continent where mayors can overthrow presidents and where another president has been crippling his own population to carry out witch hunts. The Council and the Commission should make this a key priority.
When I mention good governance I am also thinking of the role of China, which is only mentioned in passing in this resolution. It strikes me that there is a failure to sound any critical note about the sometimes disastrous consequences of China's involvement in Africa. The European Union can perhaps learn a lesson from the EUR 2 billion that the China-African Development Fund invests in Africa. The fact that Beijing also invests in countries such as Zimbabwe says it all about China's contribution to long-term democracy and good governance in Africa.
I also have a comment to make to the rapporteur. In paragraph 46 she refers to African food security and food sovereignty. What I believe is lacking in this resolution is any text going into a problem that has been around for a number of years, namely the lease or even purchase by outside states or companies of large areas of agricultural land, with the harvest going to foreign investors and therefore not benefiting the malnourished local population. Such situations are really quite distressing. Furthermore, these investments do not provide any jobs. It is a shame that the resolution does not address this specific problem, which is currently receiving a lot of attention in the media once again.
(DE) Mr President, as chairman of the Ad-hoc Delegation for Relations with the Pan-African Parliament, I would like to take the opportunity today to thank the many people involved. First of all, I would like to thank Maria Martens, who has prepared an excellent report on progress made regarding the agreed EU-Africa Strategy. Secondly, I would like to thank the institutions involved. We have managed, within the framework of a hexalogue - that is, involving six interlocutors - to reach an understanding between the two Parliaments. Both Commissions have agreed, as have the two Parliaments as well as the two Councils. As far as the Council is concerned, I would specifically like to single out the legal service, which is always particularly important when it comes to such matters, as common positions sometimes fail here. However, following the first meeting in Adis Ababa, we have managed, in our second meeting today, to implement and finally agree on what we had agreed concerning the involvement of the two Parliaments.
I would like to comment on what Mr Hutchinson said. What is really happening? Yes, many bad things are happening in Africa. However, my impression - and perhaps this is coincidental - is that, since the agreement of this common strategy, Africa has reacted differently to coups. In Mauretania, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Madagascar, Africa has reacted by suspending the membership of these countries. That did not happen in the past. Back then, it would have been business as usual.
I hope that the next joint annual progress report will be much more specific than the first in its presentation of the results and in its indication of the financial envelopes. It is particularly important that we are vigilant in terms of honouring the commitments made by the European Union and its Member States with a view to selecting the Millennium Development Goals. We must also ensure that the global recession, which is affecting everyone, does not disproportionately penalise the countries and peoples of Africa, given that they are already the most vulnerable.
Secondly, the continuing financial and economic crisis may, unfortunately, worsen the situation facing African countries. The leading global financial institutions are making the following predictions for 2009. The IMF estimates that global GDP will shrink by 1%, while the World Bank estimates a fall of 2%. The WTO predicts a decrease in the value of global trade of as much as 9%. It will be the first time that this has happened in 50 years. The crisis facing the most developed countries will, according to the IMF, go on to affect developing countries, including those in Africa, while rising unemployment and poverty might cause civil unrest and, in some cases, may even lead to war.
In the last year we have made little progress on the targets we set ourselves and, given that the action plan covers the period up to 2010, we must take immediate action in two important areas. Firstly, we must cooperate on democratic governance, the strengthening of institutions and enhancement of the role of civil society, with particular attention to gender policies. Secondly, we must cooperate to address basic social needs, the fight against hunger and the launch of development programmes in education, health and access to basic resources such as water.
Moreover, I regret that it was not possible to conduct a thorough reform of the institutional mechanisms governing Parliament's responsibility for development policy. I remember that you asked for the country strategy papers to be debated not just here but also in partners' national parliaments. The European Council did not allow me to do that, which is why I sent the country strategy papers to the joint parliamentary assembly. Through that channel, you sent them on to the various parliaments of Europe, but all that does not add up to any sort of institutional rule, as I sincerely wish were the case. As a reminder, I add that that will continue to be one of my absolute priorities, because we would make enormous progress if the European Development Funds were included in the budget. While this will not be included in the budget, we will still have poor reasons for not letting Parliament play the role that it should, and as a result the commissioner in charge of development will sometimes be powerless. It would be far simpler if I could discuss the priorities, programmes and projects here in Parliament; I could move forward, strengthened by this backing. Unfortunately, that is not yet the case. I hope that we will get there.
I do not want to skip over issues that do not seem right to me either. I would remind you that last year, at European level, we spent the contribution of the Commission and Member States, knowing that each one put in EUR 46 billion. However, we are EUR 1.7 billion behind on the programme or, shall we say, on the objective that had been set. I am not at all satisfied with that and I think that we will have to fight for it in the future. Parliament will need to be a true ambassador for this message and exert pressure. We will need all our available strength at political level simply to hold Member States to respecting their 2005 commitments. It will not be easy. I still remember the struggle for the billion for the food facility. That was not easy, but we obtained good conditions. We got an additional billion, however it was spread over three years instead of two. Fortunately though, the projects are moving forward and their implementation is progressing in a positive way. I am therefore, naturally, entirely in agreement.
I must tell you, Mr Cook, that I do not agree when it is said that we have lost our ideals. I do not think that is the case. I think that you only have to hear the voices in this House to realise that we are still extremely committed to defending developing countries. It is not true to say that we are not contributing to the solution. Obviously, we cannot be expected to be able to solve everything, but I shudder to think how poor the world would be without European aid.
It is not enough, I fully agree, but it represents 57% of aid worldwide. Unfortunately, I do not think that we can discuss that now, but the issue of knowing whether European aid from our Member States or from the Commission is still achieving its goals or is still effective - whether it is a good way of working - is another matter. I would like this debate to return to the issue of the establishment, or not, of budget support and conditionalities because, like you, I am very unsure about the latter.
That said, we still need to know what we want. If we want to get a government to make approaches to civil society or get its population - or its parliament in some cases - to participate, we must all the same accept that we must impose conditions. This is because it is sometimes not enough to simply say to a government 'we hope that you are going to do that', to make impassioned pleas or simply friendly suggestions. The issue surrounding conditionalities - I do not like the word conditionality and prefer to talk about criteria - is still important. When you talk, for example, about profile, I believe that it is still quite normal to be able to set one up. That profile has not been used to set the budget for the initiative. It is still quite normal for us to analyse the governance profiles of each country when we are getting ready to grant them up to an extra 25 or even 30% in financial incentives. All of these debates are still open. I do not wish to close them, but I do hope that we are able to do so at some point.
It is indeed advisable to question the quality of the development policies set up between China and Africa. We cannot criticise them for doing it, but we can wonder. I have, for example, been receiving reports for several months of Chinese contracts in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am not saying that these are bad contracts. I am simply saying that a whole series of issues merit responses. We are busy responding to them at the moment, particularly the issue of the state guarantee because it is an agreement that is made with a private enterprise. We are also dealing with the percentage of loans compared to gifts, the fact that they did not go out to tender and the fact that it is almost the same amount as the country's debt to the European Monetary Fund. These are all issues to which a solution must be found, but not by denouncing this type of relationship. African countries have the right to make partnership agreements with the Chinese too. I will not return to this point.
It is true that for the moment - as was said in another meeting - there are superimpositions and duplications. There is even competition and it is not always useful competition. I can tell you that a lot of progress has been made in the last two years, particularly with the World Bank. I can tell you that seeing the new message, strategy and philosophy that I detect at the World Bank makes me quite optimistic. There is therefore room for another type of cooperation; for collaboration between the various partners, and I think that you have really put your finger on a fundamental point, which we will need to take a close look at.
Secondly, I am busy preparing a communication - the April package that I promised - which goes beyond public development assistance. It will attempt to mobilise a whole series of the Commission's sectional budgets for development policies. I must tell you that there are some really interesting leads. I am also working with the European Investment Bank on that package, particularly regarding supportive infrastructure to try to develop them quickly and have quite a quick impact. I will come to Parliament with that in April. I would just like to say that I still have one more very important issue to cover, which is the role of civil society and national parliaments.
I will finish with that. Mr Hutchinson once suggested that some experiments could be carried out with Members of this House, and perhaps members of the parliaments of Member States, to go wherever it were possible to do so, and hold debates on the country strategy papers. I have had the opportunity to do so in three different countries. It worked very well, but it is obvious that it worked well because in those three countries we had the support of their governments, because without such support on this issue it is extremely difficult. I therefore think that you are right: mobilising parliamentary action is certainly one of the priorities. In any case, believe me that I will do everything in my power to ensure this.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, I actually do not have much more to add. This is the first debate about the implementation of the strategy. We have made a start, but we are still at the beginning. There is still an exceptional amount left to do. Africa remains the poorest continent. You have all pointed out where our concerns lie and what challenges we face, be it in relation to peace and security, economic growth, good governance, building capacity or the role of the parliaments and civil society. The Commissioner has made the necessary remarks in that regard.
In this context, it is true that budget support - that is, financial aid directly included in the budget of beneficiary countries - could usefully contribute to providing more predictable aid that is targeted at priority sectors and is therefore more effective. That is why the Commission has come up with the idea of concluding Millennium Development Goal (MDG) contracts, which it intends to propose to certain countries in order to commit funds for a six-year period and put in place annual monitoring that emphasises the achievement of results regarding health and education.
Our report stresses the importance of such an initiative, but it also raises a series of questions that require clear answers. What criteria, for example, will the Commission propose that developing countries must meet in order to aspire to concluding this type of contract? What will the lifespan of such a project be and what will be the conditions for carrying it out? We would also like to emphasise that the Commission has not yet published any official communication on the subject; if you wish to know more there are currently no internal documents to which to refer, only the basic information available on the Committee on Development's website.
Although the Commission's budget support has several positive features, such as being linked to the achievement of results regarding health and education, or generally being planned over three years, you should know that it is far from perfect. For example, I remind you that the Commission, just as with the majority of other aid providers, will only grant budget support to countries that have implemented an International Monetary Fund programme. This situation is particularly problematic when we know that such programmes can limit the government's capacity to invest in development and when overly ambitious goals are set, particularly as regards inflation and the budget deficit.
I do not want to finish without touching for a moment on the Court of Auditors' recent Special Report on European Commission Development Assistance to Health Services in Sub-Saharan Africa. The report's conclusions are worrying. From a financial point of view, we see that public aid contributions to the health sector have not increased since 2000. Furthermore, it appears that budget support has been very little used for the health sector in sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, Commissioner, you understand why in our report we return to the idea that it is absolutely essential for us to be more focused on the health sector, but also that there is nothing to guarantee that it is the MDG contracts that will enable us to achieve this.
The Commission has already greatly increased the use of budget support and will do so again over the course of the next six years, within the framework of the tenth European Development Fund (EDF). It is to make this instrument more effective and more predictable and so the Commission has, in consultation with the Member States and other stakeholders, devised a longer-term form of budget support, which we have called the MDG contract, for countries that meet certain criteria: good past performance, reliable public finance management, appropriate sectional policy, and so on. The MDG contract is the natural evolution of general budget supports, not just because it is more predictable but above all because it is focused on results and can have a response that is graduated according to performance. These are partner states that commit to focusing their policies, and consequently their spending, on the MDG.
The MDG contract offers the following key elements: a six-year commitment, that is six full years as opposed to the normal duration of three years for general budget supports; a guaranteed, fixed payment of at least 70% of the total commitments, provided that there is no breach of the conditions in which payments become due or of the essential and fundamental elements of the cooperation; a variable component of up to 60%, intended to reward performance with a view to achieving the MDG and linked to results indicators, mainly in the fields of health and education, as well as progress in public finance management.
After evaluating 10 countries, the Commission awarded MDG contracts in seven of them: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. These programmes were presented to and awarded by the Member States last December. Three contracts have already been signed: Zambia and Rwanda - which I signed personally - as well as Mali. The others will be finalised in the next few weeks. Collectively, these seven programmes represent approximately EUR 1.8 billion. In other words: some 50% of the overall general budget support and some 14% of the tenth EDF's total for national indicative programmes.
This is therefore not just a matter of the protection of workers, but of safeguarding the competitiveness of companies that respect the rules. In a word, it is about prevention of the grey economy. As long as subcontracting chains are a surreptitious way to keep wages down and avoid paying tax and social contributions, the burden will fall on the taxpayer and competing companies, most of which are small- and medium-sized enterprises. The subcontractors too, which are frequently small firms, need clear rules when they are working for very big contractors.
However important subcontracting may be for increasing productivity and competitiveness, we fully recognise the need for effective measures to ensure that it neither encourages nor facilitates non-compliance with employment conditions, particularly where there are long subcontracting chains. Adequate, effective, deterrent penalties are needed to ensure that subcontractors meet their legal and contractual obligations in full, in particular in relation to workers' rights. Greater transparency in the subcontracting process will lead to greater overall protection of workers' rights, an issue to which the Commission is - and will remain - very attached, as you know.
The report also seems to go in this direction in paragraph 15, where it calls for an impact assessment on the added value and feasibility of such a Community instrument. As regards the call for the Commission to guarantee effective compliance with the directive on the posting of workers, made in paragraph 25, I would like to point out that we have recently set up a high-level working party on the posting of workers. This working party consists of representatives from the Member States and the social partners and is aimed at improving the practical application of the directive and, in particular, administrative cooperation among Member States. It will hold its first meeting on 25 March.
I fully agree that this problem deserves more complete research and that, before presenting draft legislation, we must study carefully various non-regulatory methods for dealing with some of the issues raised in the report, in other words: improved cooperation and coordination among national authorities, inspection and other national enforcement authorities; an awareness of good practice within companies; current guidelines and standards; initiatives on social responsibility; and transnational company agreements, into which are already built innovative provisions relating to risk assessment procedures and the supervision of subcontractors.
His report effectively covers trade in goods, services, investment and intellectual property, and development issues. A joint alternative resolution by the PPE-DE, ALDE and UEN Groups has now been tabled, because it was felt that the original committee decision was the upshot of a rather unrepresentative vote, which left the report with several protectionist clauses intact. The alternative resolution better highlights how important a trading partner India is for the EU and the benefits that the liberalisation of trade can bring to both countries.
The EU and India launched negotiations in June 2007 on what is termed a free trade agreement, but what many would probably more correctly call a preferential trade agreement. The report calls for the conclusion of a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced free trade agreement between the EU and India, which should improve market access to goods and services, covering substantially many areas of trade, and including provisions on regulatory transparency in areas relevant to mutual trade investment, as well as things like sanitary and phytosanitary standards, intellectual property protection, trade facilitation and customs.
The main points of the report indicate that, if you look at trade in goods, India's average applied tariffs have decreased to levels that are now comparable with other countries in Asia - notably India's average applied tariff, which is now 14.5% compared to an EU average of 4.1%. It also notes India's concerns about the implications of REACH, costly certificates for exporting fruit to the EU and costly conformity procedures for the EC mark, and stresses that those issues must be resolved in the preferential trade agreement.
Finally, the report recognises that a substantial development chapter is an essential part of any trade agreement, and that we should ensure trade and foreign direct investment. It also recognises that there is concern, particularly in this House, over issues such as environmental standards and core labour, occupational health and safety legislation. We should also recognise that, in seeking some sort of balance between trade issues and environmental protection, ILO standards etc, the pendulum can often swing too far one way and we end up with these taking precedence over trade and condemning poor countries to even more poverty because we make it difficult for entrepreneurs in those countries to develop capacities.
In particular, I am grateful to Mr Kamall and the Committee on International Trade for the excellent work that they, along with the associated Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Development, have done in preparing the report on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement. The exchanges with Parliament have been very comprehensive, and the draft motion for a resolution deals with almost all possible aspects of the negotiations on a free trade agreement between the European Union and India. The opinions expressed are a useful tool for our negotiations on free trade agreements.
On Wednesday, our Parliament expressed its opinion on the future free trade agreement between the European Union and India. Thanks to the work of the socialists, the text adopted in committee points out the economic and social fragility of India, a country in which 80% of the population lives on less than USD 2 per day. To confront this reality, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has tabled a number of amendments pointing out that any strengthening of the EU's trade relations with India should be accompanied by a strict framework, to prevent any liberalisation of public services, to guarantee access to public healthcare and essential medicines, and to protect the interests of the most vulnerable people and sectors. Unsurprisingly, the right in Parliament has formed an alliance to propose a much more liberal text in plenary, calling in particular for the liberalisation of banking, insurance, postal services and public procurement. In Wednesday's vote, I will be defending the socialist vision of fair and equitable trade and I will oppose any attempt by the right to go back on these principles.
I welcome this report because it calls for the conclusion of a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and India which will improve market access for goods and services, covering substantially all trade, including provisions on regulatory transparency in areas relevant to mutual trade and investment, as well as conformity standards and assessment, SPS, IPR including enforcement, trade facilitation and customs, public procurement, and trade and competitions, as well as trade and development and the human rights clause as an essential element of the FTA.
Commissioner, I should like to start by asking a very simple question: when consumers go to supermarkets to buy milk or yoghurt, why do they buy it? For the milk and the yoghurt or for the bottle and the tub? I put this question to you because the perception and attitude have been skilfully conveyed to consumers that they are buying a foodstuff where the industry that processes it, markets it and transports it is now more important than the agricultural product, the raw material itself. About 15 years ago, agricultural produce accounted for approximately 50% of the final value of the product; today it does not exceed 20%.
We are not attempting to draw dividing lines, to classify the productive sectors in the supply chain, the farmers, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers as 'the good', 'the bad' and 'the ugly', because I do not believe that we are living in a 'Wild West' society and economy; I believe that we are living in an economy based on the regulations of the internal market of the European Union, a market which provides opportunity for growth and competitiveness when it operates transparently, but which ousts or eliminates producers and economic activities when unfair and opaque functions penetrate it.
In addition, analysis of the structural factors leads us to fear a further escalation of prices of agricultural raw materials in the medium and long term. By improving the operation of the food supply chain, it ought to be possible in future to avoid such high rises in food prices and to curb the instability of consumer prices. I share most of the concerns raised in the report in relation to the need to improve the overall operation of the food supply chain. In particular, there is a need for increased transparency all along the chain, in order to offer consumers better information and to improve the way added value is shared out along the chain.
In the communication on food prices adopted in December, the Commission also proposed, in the form of a road map, several solutions for improving the operation of the food supply chain in Europe. It is absolutely essential to make progress in the implementation of this road map. In particular we must make progress in the introduction of a permanent European Observatory on the food supply chain and food prices. By supplying reliable information on prices from one end of the chain to the other, we will be able to help combat the lack of transparency, whilst improving our understanding of how the chain operates.
We must also make progress in analysing how added value is shared out along the chain. I attach particular importance to this issue. As is recognised in the communication on food prices, imbalances between the negotiating power of agricultural producers and the rest of the chain are having a serious effect on producer margins in the agricultural sector. It goes without saying that an effort to bring clarity and understanding to the question of how added value is shared out would be a first step towards restoring the balance of negotiating power all along the chain. In this regard, it should be stressed that the competitiveness of the European Union's food chain cannot be built to the detriment of some of its component parts. It is essential for food producers and retailers in the agro-food sector to be able to continue to rely on a sustainable, competitive agricultural production platform within the European Union.
In a context of decreased purchasing power in Europe, it was important that Parliament reach a decision on a problem for which the solutions are, nevertheless, known. In fact, the difference in prices between the beginning and the end of the food supply chain can be as high as a one to five ratio and, even if the liberals still refuse to admit it, the problems of the market need tackling to ensure reasonable prices for consumers and decent revenues for farmers. I myself have proposed that the importance of market-regulation instruments - more necessary than ever in the face of the crisis that we are going through - be reaffirmed in the text.
In addition, it values training as a very important factor for the success of professionals in the artistic and creative sector, since artistic studies that focus on developing a career and profession require of the students, in addition to talent, a solid cultural basis that can only be acquired through multidisciplinary and systematic training. This increases the opportunities for access to employment in the sector in so far as it provides a general education, a research methodology, entrepreneurial abilities and business knowledge, as well as skills in various areas of activity.
This issue is occupying an increasingly important place at European level. In fact, we all agree that culture and the arts form a fundamental part of education. They help to develop sensitivity and self-confidence, essential qualities not only for our role as citizens but also for the role of economic operator that is in each of us. There can be no doubt about this. Artistic education is a vector of well-being, creativity and social integration. It is essential that it be promoted in Europe's education systems from as early an age as possible.
The importance of the arts and artistic education in building a better society goes hand in hand with its impact on economic life. According to recent estimates, the contribution of the cultural and creative industries to the creation of economic wealth is estimated at 2.6% of European GDP. In addition, any economic activity can benefit from the arts and cultural education. Innovation encourages the creation of synergies between traditional areas of activity and more innovative ones. Today we must combine technology and design, whilst integrating the principles of sustainability and economic viability. This combination requires a redefinition of the ways in which knowledge is transmitted and acquired.
The European Agenda for Culture has introduced new methods, particularly the structured dialogue with civil society and, recently, new open methods of cultural coordination. The implementation of these methods has been made possible thanks to an initial three-year work plan, adopted by the Council on 21 May 2008, which defines five priority action areas. In this framework, a working group made up of experts from the Member States was set up around the theme of synergies between culture and education. This group will be drawing up recommendations to identify good practices at national level and will also make a number of recommendations to the Member States and the European institutions. In addition, it will provide methods for assessing the progress achieved in the policy areas that fall under its mandate. Finally, this group should make a valuable contribution to the European Forum for Culture scheduled to take place on 29 and 30 September 2009, in Brussels.
When I received the report, I began to read it with great enthusiasm. I must say, my enthusiasm declined to some extent by the end, since I myself realised how many obstacles there are to engaging in active dialogue with citizens, and how far removed the bureaucratic machinery of the European Union is from the daily lives and wishes of its citizens. In any case, I realised thanks to the report that - perhaps unsurprisingly - the lower the educational level or status of our citizens, the less they understand integration and the more eurosceptical they are.
It has long been the wish of Members of the European Parliament, their desire but one might also say their demand, that Euronews, which is funded - at least in part - by EU money, should broadcast programmes in each Member State's official language. There is something absurd about the fact that Euronews broadcasts in Arabic or Russian but not in Hungarian or in some other Member States' languages. I am sad to report, by the way, Commissioner - I presume that you are hearing this for the first time - that cable television packages in Budapest have dropped the English-language Euronews, and are offering a Chinese-language programme instead, for unfortunately there is more demand for Chinese television than for Euronews, given that the latter is not broadcast in Hungarian, whereas there is a considerable number of Chinese people living in our country now.
This has formed the basis of the Commission's work during the last four years. I very much welcome the report by Mr Hegyi entitled 'Active dialogue with citizens on Europe'. We are striving to give the citizens of the 27 Member States of the European Union a wide range of basic information on the European Union, so that they can not only understand how the European Union could help to respond to the major challenges facing Europe and the world today, but also exchange and share their opinions on this issue.
In addition, the Commission can certainly not be alone in communicating with the citizens on the issue of Europe. A collective effort from all the institutions and all the Member States is needed. This is why we have negotiated an agreement with the Member States and with Parliament for joint communication on Europe. This political agreement entitled 'Communicating Europe in Partnership' was signed on 22 October 2008. This is the first time that the institutions of the Member States of the European Union have made a common commitment jointly to communicate on Europe with the citizens of the European Union. It is important for us now fully to implement this agreement. I am in complete agreement about the importance of the process for consulting the citizens and about the need to extend the dialogue to all levels of society.
I will take this opportunity to announce that the Commission also intends, in the context of the European elections, to run special activities in the framework of the Debate Europe Plan D initiative. As for the creation of a new website and the establishment of links with local television stations, I would like to say that the Commission is in the process of creating networks of radio and television operators that will broadcast programmes on European issues. Once they are all up and running, these networks, together with Euronews, will reach between 60 and 90 million citizens each week in all the languages of the European Union.
We must make it possible for European citizens to have a more effective voice in shaping European Union policies. To do so, appropriate education is needed, for there is greater opposition to integration among those with low levels of education. For instance, it is essential to provide education in general EU and citizenship knowledge in open universities or as part of secondary school curricula. It is important for people to know their rights, to know that the EU is not working above their heads, but with them. We need to ensure that appropriate information sources are made available in the less developed regions. The guarantor of a functioning democracy is not the bureaucracy but the citizens themselves - this is the core of democratic culture. It is indispensable that the media help develop communication between institutions and citizens, as well as communication among citizens.
We cannot expect responsible decisions, or any decisions at all, on the part of citizens, if we do not provide them with suitable information. Providing information is our responsibility and our duty, whereas decision making is the citizens' right. This May it will be five years since Hungary joined the European Union, and we can already see that the European Union is not faceless, but that the EU is us, the sum of all individual citizens. We need to know that decision making is in our hands. So let us take advantage of this opportunity.
One reason is obvious: the Union has a very male face. The President of the Commission is a man, as are almost 70% of the Commissioners. Likewise, it is a man that strikes the gavel of the President of the European Parliament and a man that is Chairman of most of the parliamentary committees. It is important that gender equality is implemented as much as possible in the forthcoming term when 'top' posts in the EU are being filled. At least one woman should be appointed to these.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is particularly fitting that Commissioner Michel is taking part in our debate. As we know, he always pays great attention to human rights issues and tragedies in Africa. In fact, Mr Michel's presence gives me hope that the Commission may give serious consideration to an issue that today not only affects 28 African countries and various countries in the Middle East and neighbouring countries, but is now a particularly distressing problem within the European Union itself.
The mass immigration that has taken place in recent years has brought this tragedy to EU countries. Tens of thousands of girls and young women are at risk every day of suffering a terrible practice that injures them irreversibly from a physical point of view, but also does extremely serious psychological damage. That is why - although Parliament has already condemned this practice on several occasions in previous years and in fact gave funding through DAPHNE to 14 projects to combat female genital mutilation - that is why today we again find ourselves discussing this topic, because the phenomenon has unfortunately not become less prevalent, but remains on the increase.
Consider a girl who attends a French, Italian or Belgian school and suddenly, after having socialised with her peers, finds herself snatched from normality and forced to suffer a tragedy that will mark her for life. This girl is not only physically mutilated, but it is impossible for her to resume a normal relationship with other people; she feels diminished, different, and in our society we do not want people who are different. We want people who, no matter what their religion, skin colour or geographical origin, can work together to build a better Europe, closer to its citizens.
For this reason, Mr President, Commissioner, we as Parliament - and I would like to thank all my colleagues from the committee who helped me draft this report - want the laws of all Member States to be harmonised so that female genital mutilation is classed as an offence. We do not want palliative proposals such as 'pricking'. We want women to be truly equal with men; we do not want initiation rites, but real integration instead. We want NGOs to be able to carry out their work, we want a prevention policy that involves immigrant women's associations, we want to punish anybody who seeks to mutilate girls and drag them into a perverse spiral of desperation and marginalisation.
The European Commission has very clearly denounced, both within the Union and in third countries, the unacceptable nature of traditional practices that seriously undermine the fundamental right of women and young girls to respect for their physical and mental integrity. We are obviously in full agreement with the report. We think that all the Member States of the European Union should take strong measures. I would say much stronger measures should be taken to put an end to these practices, both within the European Union and in third countries, because it is totally unacceptable and quite incredible that this can still go on within the European Union. We must also ensure, in the framework of all the political dialogues that we hold with third countries, that the latter fully understand our position. I would like to move away from the text for a moment to say that I can assure you that this issue is always on the agenda in all the political dialogues that we hold with developing countries.
In Europe, our main instrument is the DAPHNE III programme, which supports European non-governmental organisations and local and regional public institutions and authorities in their fight against female genital mutilation. Since its launch in 1997, DAPHNE has cofinanced 14 projects specifically dedicated to this issue, providing a total amount of around EUR 2.4 million. The DAPHNE projects have enabled us to implement community training and support programmes, to carry out awareness campaigns, to analyse national legislation, to gather information and statistics, to develop tools and to establish best practices for use by the actors on the ground, and to recommend policy directions to European and national decision makers.
I am going to turn my attention away from the text again for just a moment. I have to tell you that I am somewhat shocked by a certain kind of cowardice on the part of our governments and some politicians who consider this to be part of culture and therefore untouchable. I am sorry: the minimum we should expect of people who come to Europe is that they comply with the rules in force. I believe that there can be no two-speed justice; there can be no concept of two speeds. This has no effect on the capacity of a European country to welcome incomers, rather the contrary. This is a debate that I myself have experienced in my own country in the past. I must say that I am shocked that some people, on the pretext of respecting the culture of migrants, basically refuse to penalise this type of thing. I think that if we want at least to sort out this issue within Europe, we must reach the stage where we penalise these practices. We need to have this political courage, and I do not think that it would hamper a country's ability to welcome incomers if we were to say: 'This is our constitution, these are our rules, these are our human values, and you must comply with them. If you do not comply with them, you will be acting outside the law and you will be punished.' That is the end of my aside, but I am glad I have said these things because I fully share your irritation regarding this issue.
Thirdly, it is supporting initiatives intended to strengthen the scope for action of political leaders, along with awareness campaigns aimed at all sectors of society. The multiannual Hague Programme, covering the various actions that will be carried out to develop the area of justice, freedom and security, comes to an end in 2010. We are going to present the new Stockholm programme 2010-2014 in a communication in Spring 2009. I can confirm to you that this programme will lay great emphasis on the aspect relating to the protection of fundamental rights and of victims, including the promotion and protection of children's and women's rights.
Each year in Europe, 180 000 migrant women suffer or are at risk from suffering genital mutilation. It is important to remember that these mutilations constitute a violation of human rights that has very serious physical and psychological consequences. These practices cannot be justified on the grounds of cultural or religious traditions. In order to put a stop to them, the Member States must enforce compliance with the prohibition laid down in their criminal law, and the practice of mutilation must be considered a criminal offence. At the same time, actual or potential victims must be given access to legal and medical assistance.
The EU must increase its support for those NGOs that are doing remarkable work on the ground in the areas of prevention and assistance. At national and European levels, targeted information and education campaigns would remove the taboos associated with these practices whilst informing families of the criminal consequences of such mutilations. It is therefore important for the EU to tackle this problem by defining joint preventive actions to prohibit the practice of mutilation in the EU and by referring to this prohibition in all cooperation agreements concluded with third countries. Genital mutilation is a social problem that concerns us all.
I also highlight the importance of language as a factor of social inclusion. I confirm the importance of dialogue with other regions of the globe, paying attention to the specific links existing in terms of language, history and culture between the countries of the EU and third countries. I indicate the need for policies supporting translation, both literary and technical. I tackle the issue of multilingualism in the audiovisual sector, the need to support language teachers, and the extension of language competence indicators to all the official EU languages, without prejudice to their also being extended to other languages spoken and studied in Europe, including classical Greek and Latin.
I welcome your support for our approach. To reach these groups, individual motivation and the implementation of appropriate teaching methods are essential. New technologies, such as the Internet and interactive audiovisual media, offer many possibilities to reach these groups and to develop and adapt teaching methods to their specific needs and abilities. At European level, our lifelong learning programme promotes all languages: the official languages of the European Union, regional and minority languages, and the other languages spoken around the world. This is a reflection of the new reality in the Union and also of the linguistic needs of our citizens.
Unfortunately, demonstrations have been organised, even at the European Parliament, and initiatives have been launched which have called for the dismantling of the Babeş-Bolyai University on the grounds of wrongful discrimination based on ethnic separation. This is why I wish to draw your attention to the danger posed by the deterioration in the tone of the debate on ethnic matters. Respect for minorities' rights and the promotion of multilingualism must not be perverted by being turned into smokescreens behind which actions are being carried out against the European spirit and interethnic harmony. Multilingualism must be a common denominator, not a factor of division for the European Union.
in writing. - (DE) Linguistic diversity is important. It is part of the day-to-day reality in the European Union and is gaining increasing significance in the relationships between the Member States, in the way in which our multicultural societies live together and in the common policy measures taken by the European Union. However, the decision-making power on matters of language policy lies primarily with the Member States. It is not the responsibility of the European Parliament to lay down requirements and recommendations for language policy. The fact that the EU has a Commissioner for Multilingualism makes it clear that reform of the Commission is urgently needed and that there must be fewer Commissioners than there are Member States.
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are discussing is very clear and straightforward: there are approximately 500 million mobile telephones in use in Europe and 30 different types of charger. The technical reason for this difference: there is none. There is no technical reason. It is merely a source of unfair speculation on the part of producers, on the one hand, and a creator of obvious environmental damage, on the other, since, as a result of this inescapable trap that consumers are caught in, hundreds of millions of phone chargers are being dispersed into the environment every two to three years.
We would therefore say straight away, Commissioner Verheugen, that, whatever guarantee of self-regulation producers wish to give, we will have to make it very clear that we will intervene with regulation should this response be insufficient, and that this regulation should not relate solely to mobile phones and mobile phone chargers, but also to other digital devices for which the same problem exists. In this way Europe could also - I have finished, Madam President - impose standards that could ultimately be imposed as international standards, too. This is a great opportunity concerning a technical matter, but an important one for European consumers.
I fully agree with them that we must put an end to the ever-growing number of chargers and that it must in future be possible to charge mobile phones using a single, standardised charger. The hundreds of millions of useless chargers and adapters in Europe place a ridiculous burden on the environment and, at the same time, are an expensive irritation for consumers. Nowadays, anyone who changes their mobile phone generally needs a completely different charger. Even different models from the same manufacturer do not use a standardised charger.
This is good, but it does not go far enough. The Commission would like to see complete harmonisation on the basis of a uniform standard and a binding undertaking from the industry to do this. The Commission expects the industry to produce a binding agreement in the form of a memorandum by the end of April. This memorandum should be signed by the major manufacturers of mobile phones and should ensure that every charger is capable of charging every mobile phone and that every mobile phone can be charged by every charger.
I believe that the schedule presented here by the Commission is a good one, as it requires the industry to come to a voluntary agreement by April or be subject to technical legislation. Of course, this is not as easy as it seems. On the one hand, we have the connection between the charger and the mobile phone. It will be straightforward to establish a technical standard for this. However, on the other hand the wall socket presents a problem that we are familiar with from European standards. In this case we should also develop proposals to find a solution to this problem, which concerns not only Europe but also the rest of the world. Perhaps we could involve the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) in order to find a worldwide solution.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, we are today discussing a subject that is of special interest to consumers, namely the standard connection for mobile phone chargers. As a Liberal, I am, of course, in favour of allowing the internal market to work and of the minimum possible amount of government intervention in the market. That said, consumers must also have choices. At the moment, consumers buying a new phone have no choice at all. The charger must automatically be bought with the phone, and this frequently gives rise to great annoyance amongst consumers. What is more, research shows that consumers spend EUR 300 million a year on new chargers because they are automatically included with the purchase of new phones. The result of this is that there, too, the environment is also burdened to the tune of EUR 300 million a year, and that is without mentioning the waste of energy that these cheap chargers cause, as they are often left in the socket even after the phone itself has been disconnected, where they continue to consume energy.
My colleague, Mr Cappato, and I have been calling for years for the introduction of a European standard and I would very much like to compliment the Commissioner for the manner in which he has regulated this by flirting a little with the industry whilst also threatening it, saying to it, 'You come up with a solution or, if not, we will introduce binding legislation'. I would like to congratulate him even more on that approach, as, being a Liberal, I am against mandatory regulation where coaxing can be used instead. Coaxing means that people prefer to do something because they see the benefit of it and I think that the Commissioner has achieved exceptional success in this.
I have told the following little joke a few times before: when I met my wife 35 years ago, I coaxed her into going out with me. If I had forced her, she would probably not have seen the added value we have now and the idea would therefore not have lasted this long. I believe that this example also applies to the industry, as, if the industry has to resolve the issue itself, it will make a better job of it than if the solution is laid down by politicians.
I therefore think that this is an excellent solution. I hope that, in time, you will manage not only to bring in a standard for phone chargers but also for more items of electrical equipment, as the same irritation applies to those other electrical appliances. If a family goes away for a weekend, it might take 30 chargers with it. There are always people, including in this House today, for instance, who have to ask whether anyone has a charger they can borrow as they have forgotten their own. You then need to find a specific charger of a specific make and model. My compliments, again, Commissioner. I hope that this really happens in 2012 and I hope that you act strongly if the industry does not live up to its commitments, as that is very important. You have to keep the big stick in reserve, but preferably reach a solution through coaxing and self-regulation. You have succeeded in that, and you have my congratulations.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I had already noted that, Mr Rübig. I wanted to say to you that that is why I am so relaxed about this issue, because I do not believe that we are making life unnecessarily difficult for the industry, as the USB standard is already in place. All my experts tell me that the existing standard can be used for all hand-held devices. You cannot use it at the same time for desktop PCs and mobile phones, but it is possible for all hand-held devices.
This is also my answer to Mrs Ţicău. The standard you are asking about is in fact already in existence. In addition, I should tell you, Mrs Ţicău, that intensive work is already underway into the issue of energy consumption and the effect of chargers of this kind on the environment. We will look into this question at the latest when we start work on implementing the directive concerning products that use energy, for which we have presented you with a new proposal.
A complete revision of the visa rules is foreseen with the visa code on which my ALDE Group colleague, Henrik Lax, is rapporteur. Once adopted, this piece of legislation which we are now discussing will become an integral part of the visa code. The underlying rationale for separating the proposals was that the Commission expected the adoption of the visa code to take longer than the present proposal, and they did not want the adoption of the visa code to hold up the launch of the VIS.
It is my understanding that the central system for the VIS will be ready by December this year and could start operating in the first region, North Africa, in early 2010. I have been negotiating with the Council for quite a long time. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted my report in November 2007. Unfortunately we could not get a first-reading agreement, so in July 2008 I asked Parliament to endorse my report; however, during the French Presidency we were able to make sufficient progress for me to be able to recommend adopting this compromise at second reading.
I am pleased to note that Parliament has accepted the Council's common position and thus given shape to the political agreement which it and the Council reached on this proposal during the trialogue on 2 December 2008. I would thank both Parliament and the Member States for the spirit of compromise they showed in achieving the formal adoption of this instrument, and in particular I should like to thank the rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, and the co-rapporteurs for their support and cooperation. This agreement will allow preparations to continue for the launch of the Visa Information System scheduled for the end of this year.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports with a broad majority the compromise that a Member State which is responsible for accepting and processing applications must also be able as a last resort to work with external service providers. A decisive factor in our agreement to cooperation of this kind is that the Member States remain responsible for data protection and data security in these cases. This means that the electronic data sent by the external service providers to the authorities of the relevant Member State must always be fully encrypted.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I value the commitment of the rapporteur very highly and would like to thank her and everyone involved very warmly for their excellent work over recent years. Nevertheless, I will be abstaining from voting, mainly because I do believe that taking fingerprints and the entire process of using biometric identifiers is out of proportion to the size of the problem. I think that the desire of home affairs ministers and security authorities to collect as much personal data as possible is deeply questionable.
The regulations on outsourcing also cause me some concern. Strict, standardised regulations are certainly needed, as some Member States are already using external service providers. It is understandable that in many strictly limited cases it can be useful to transfer the processing of visa applications to external service providers. However, this must not be done at the expense of the applicants and of data security. I do not believe that the compromise agreed with the Council in this respect is adequate. Both the Legal Service of the Parliament and the European Data Protection Supervisor have indicated the risks involved in outsourcing, when the external service provider is not in an area under diplomatic protection. Unfortunately, the Council has ignored these concerns.
A further problem is the service charge involved in outsourcing. I believe it is wrong to pass this charge on to the applicants. The visa fee of EUR 60 is already too high and very difficult for people from third countries to afford. If a charge of up to EUR 30 is added, this does not correspond with my idea of an open and hospitable Europe. Undoubtedly it can make things easier in the case of very large countries not to have to travel halfway across the country to a consulate to apply for a visa, but instead to be able to submit the application to an external service provider. However, in my opinion, the higher charges would immediately cancel out this benefit.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, it comes as no surprise to hear Baroness Ludford of the Euro-fanatic Liberal Democrat party wanting to harmonise yet another area of what should be sovereign national policy. Why on earth would any EU Member State want a common system for the application and processing of visas for third-party nationals? Deciding who can and cannot enter a nation state should be the sole concern of the nation state - except that, in the minds of the Euro-fanatics, European nation states no longer exist, having been replaced by the great EU borderless state.
Since 1997, about 6 million migrants have entered the UK. About 4 million have left, leaving a net population increase of over 2 million. The current immigration rate to Britain now results in a net population gain of over 200 000 people per year - or a net population gain of over 1 million people every five years. This is equivalent to a new city the size of Birmingham. Most of these migrants enter legally, because they are EU citizens. In addition to that, we probably have one million illegal immigrants. England is one of the most densely populated countries in the world - more densely populated than India, China or Japan. On current trends, our population of 61 million is set to rise to 75 million by 2051, and is projected to rise to 85 million by 2081.
I expect that its advocates would justify it as merely introducing common criteria and processes to make everything run more smoothly. However, it might have some unintended consequences. Look at another example of EU legislation championed by the Liberal Democrats. The European arrest warrant means that British citizens accused of a crime by other EU Member States cannot now be protected by British courts or even the Home Secretary, even when it is obvious that a grave injustice is being done. Any corrupt legal system may now demand the surrender of a British citizen, and we have to comply. We have surrendered the right to protect our own citizens. Soon we will have trials in absentia and the common recognition of fines and confiscation orders. All this was voted for and welcomed by the Liberal Democrats. These measures overturn the most basic freedoms enjoyed by the English for centuries, as enshrined in Magna Carta and the 1689 Bill of Rights.
This afternoon, Graham Watson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, urged Gordon Brown to take Britain into the European single currency, which is something that anyone in touch with the real world would know is economic suicide. Now the Liberal Democrat fanatics want us to embrace a common system for the application of visas. When the London voters become aware of Baroness Ludford's position on these issues, hopefully they will grant her a one-way visa out of the European Parliament in the European elections on 4 June 2009.
Firstly, I disagree with the use of external service providers. When we adopted the second version of the Schengen Information System, SIS II, with the agreement of all the political groups, this Parliament refused to allow private companies to have access to the data, even though at the time this merely involved car registrations. What justifies Parliament's radical change in position in allowing private companies to gather these data, which are sensitive personal data, such as fingerprints? These companies will be able to retain these data for one week, according to the terms laid down in the compromise.
Secondly, there should have been better data protection. Diplomatic protection is vital to ensure effective protection of the personal rights of individuals. How can the protection of data gathered by private companies be guaranteed, given that this diplomatic protection has not been assured? Are we already forgetting the SWIFT case, involving the transmission of data gathered by the US authorities? If this type of situation can happen in a country like the United States, just imagine what could happen in less developed countries with less protection of fundamental rights.
Thirdly, the cost of visas will rise and will vary from country to country. The Commission proposal aimed to prevent visa shopping. By allowing private companies to charge a fee which will be added to the visa price, this will create a difference in the cost of visas from one Member State to another. We will therefore be encouraging exactly what we wanted to combat, namely visa shopping. If the cost of a visa in one Member State is EUR 60 and in another it is EUR 90, where will most of the applications be made? This will particularly apply in the case of families with several members. This is without even mentioning the need to review the visa facilitation agreements, which were so firmly supported by this Parliament, such as those with the Ukraine and Serbia.
I believe it is also more citizen-friendly if the process can be made shorter by calling for the cooperation of the Member States or bringing in external service providers, if the data protection regulations are followed. We will guarantee that they will be followed, because the necessary precautions have been taken. I would like to reassure everyone who is concerned that there will be abuse of the system or the regulations will not be adhered to as a result of using external service providers. In my country we have had very positive experiences in this respect. For this reason, I am supporting this more citizen-friendly approach.
Up to this point I also support the rapporteur and I would like to congratulate her. In the course of our work together, this has not always been the case, Baroness Ludford. However, I am not as pleased about the fact that we cannot take fingerprints from children from the age of six upwards. I object simply because this would result in a safer situation for children, because their identity could be determined without doubt and because we could prevent child trafficking and other criminal activities. I regret this. However, I hope that after a study has been completed and after three years at the latest everyone will be sensible enough to decide that it is possible to take fingerprints from the age of six in order to provide better protection for children.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have worked with me. I have been 'Mrs VIS' for over four years and, together with the shadows, we have formed quite a close club and I will miss you all. I will particularly miss you, if I may say so, Madam President, as we may not see each other after June. We have been an all-female club, which has been delightful, but I would also like to thank all the staff involved, who have not all been female. They have been excellent.
In this situation we must ensure that Member States apply standard rules with regard to issuing Schengen visas and that the Common Consular Instructions are redefined and adapted. Furthermore, we need to focus particular attention on protecting the biometric data of those who have supplied it. We must be aware that, although this biometric data collection system is intended to combat crime and terrorism through the provision of access and the exchange of information between Member States' police authorities, it could equally be accessed by different interest groups, if high-level security measures are not devised and implemented.
On Monday evening we had a very important debate on whether or not we can give assent on CARIFORUM. The Commission and the Council - and it is important that both institutions made these commitments - promised us that, in terms of aid promises, they would deliver on the quality of the aid and in a timely fashion. They assured us that nothing in the EPA would affect the Caribbean countries' access to medicines. They assured us that the application of the most-favoured-nation clause would not in any way impact on South-South trade and that the five-year review at the end of the first phase of this EPA would be a genuine review that would take into account development objectives.
'The interpretation of Rule 47 by AFCO to which you refer was announced at Parliament's sitting of 18 February 2009, and, in the absence of objections, was deemed adopted. [...] The proposals concerning the two EPAs [i.e. the reports by David Martin and Erika Mann] were formally announced and referred to your committee [i.e. the Committee on International Trade] only at the sitting of 19 February 2009. In the light of the above interpretation, it will no longer be possible to apply Rule 47 in relation to those two procedures, nor to any further procedures.'
As many of you will be aware, following the Council's decision last October to suspend temporarily and partially the visa-ban list, we have seen a number of positive developments in Belarus. I would point in particular to the registration of the 'For Freedom' movement and of the Centre for Chernobyl Initiatives, the printing and distribution of independent newspapers such as Narodnaya Volya and Nasha Niva, the round table on regulation of the Internet with the OSCE Representative on the Freedom of the Media, the ongoing expert consultations with OSCE/ODIHR on improving electoral legislation, and the establishment of Consultative Councils, including one on human rights issues, which brings together representatives of civil society and even the opposition.
Belarus has taken measures that are unquestionably along the lines of more democracy. I am thinking in particular of the return of two independent newspapers to news-stands, of the fact that even Mr Milinkevich's organisation has finally been legalised, of the cooperation with OSCE/ODIHR on electoral law, and of the various congresses of opposition parties or NGOs - such as the Union of Poles in Belarus - that have been able to take place. Admittedly, this progress is limited and insufficient, but it is also unprecedented and, in general, we can still conclude that progress has been made.
At the same time, we are holding on to the tool at our disposal, since the sanctions may be reintroduced at the end of the year if we consider that the progress made by then is insufficient, and we are going to continue our examination by paying ongoing attention to the situation on the ground with regard to whether progress has been made in the five key areas identified in the GAERC's conclusions of last October. Furthermore, thanks to our delegation in Minsk, the Commission is playing an active part in analysing the situation on the ground.
Ladies and gentlemen, developing our relations with this neighbour located at the heart of Europe requires us to take the time to reflect on a response, including in the longer term, to the progress made by Belarus. A response that enables us to bring Belarus closer to our European family and its values, and to do this, in fact, as our President-in-Office said, the European Council took the decision last Friday to admit Belarus to the Eastern Partnership, and, more specifically, to its multilateral component, the platforms. This Partnership will provide Belarus with an opportunity to develop new support and exchange networks with all its neighbours, including on behalf of Belarusian civil society, which wants to end its isolation and take part in the forum on civil society.
Finally, in the light of the financial and economic crisis that is also seriously affecting all of our neighbours in the East, I am personally in favour of economic support measures for Belarus. An important first step has been taken by the IMF, with the active support of its European members, and that was to grant a USD 2 billion loan to tackle the immediate effects of the crisis, by which I mean putting an end to the balance of payments. The second stage should enable Belarus to gain access to EIB loans and to more substantial EBRD loans in order to fund projects linked to the trans-European networks, while also helping to diversify the country's economic links.
It is essential that the Council maintains a carrot-and-stick approach to Belarus: if Lukashenko is offered clear incentives for internal political reform he may well respond favourably. But, equally, he needs to know that he cannot carry on as before and that any sign of increased authoritarianism and repression will cause rapprochement to cease and reduce support by the EU for Belarus's WTO membership ambitions. At this stage, inviting Lukashenko to Prague for the May Summit to launch the Eastern Partnership, to which Belarus belongs, could be a step too far in my view. We need to link closer relations to tangible commitments on the regime's part to change its ways.
Belarus must also be persuaded that recognition of the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states - as at present is the case only by Russia - is unacceptable. I believe that Belarus is seeking to distance itself from Russian control and we need to take advantage of this window of opportunity. Undoubtedly, promoting genuine change in Belarus demands patience and commitment on the part of the EU, but the prize - Belarus back in the European family of nations - is well worth aspiring to.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we, too, are happy to support the continuation of the European Union's policy of bringing about dialogue and closer cooperation with the Belarusian regime. We have been working on this for six or seven months already and we need to see whether what the European Union is aiming for also bears fruit over the coming period. That does not change the fact that we will continue to have our doubts about the intentions of a government that is not known for being democratic. I have personally had the honour of being in contact with the regime on a number of occasions and, believe me, Mr Lukashenko has not become a democrat overnight.
The fact that he wants more involvement with the European Union has to do with other factors, but the fact that that is what he wants is something that we can use in order to put pressure on him to move further along the path that he has now embarked on by taking a number of positive steps in the area of human rights. Like Mr Tannock, I think that it is still too early to speculate whether he should be rewarded with an Eastern Partnership. A real dialogue on human rights still needs to be brought about and violations of human rights are still taking place.
When it comes to dialogue on human rights, we believe that the opposition must be allowed to play a fully-fledged role. We have supported the opposition in all kinds of ways in recent years, including by means of awarding it two Sakharov prizes. Minsk thinks that it is not acceptable to support the opposition like that. There are precedents, however: for six or seven years I was personally involved in an attempt, along with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe, to bring about dialogue involving the government of Belarus and the then opposition. That attempt did not succeed, but it does represent a precedent for that kind of gathering.
When sanctions against Belarus were lifted we hoped that the process of softening the system would go a little further. It turns out, however, that this has not happened. Those who have already spoken today have mentioned this, but I would like us to remember that no other political parties have been registered, the threat to cancel the registration of parties which already exist has not been lifted, newspapers which might have been granted the right of distribution have not been granted that right, and web-based attacks on Internet sites, such as the Radio Free Europe site, have been renewed. Furthermore, President Lukashenko decided to leave Minsk and so Mrs Ferrero-Waldner's visit could not go ahead. I do not think this was a friendly gesture, and neither does it show that he respects and understands the significance of contacts with the European Union.
It is true that President Lukashenko has not recognised Abkhazia and Ossetia, but he has visited Abkhazia and it seems that there is to be close economic cooperation between these two partners - I will not say states, because of course for us Abkhazia is not a state. As for the opposition, President Lukashenko calls it a 'fifth column', and we cannot see any readiness whatsoever to recognise it, as is the case in every country, as an important element of political opposition.
I think that in this connection we should, however, maintain some kind of dialogue. I agree with what Mr Tannock said, that President Lukashenko should not be present in Prague. That would clearly be going too far, but really we should make significant and more effective use of another instrument which we have at our disposal, namely a financial instrument in the form of the funding for democratic and economic development. In connection with this I would like to ask a question - not what sums were allocated, but what sums were spent on support of democracy in Belarus last year and in 2007, not including support for radio?
We must also be very careful. The first months have given us only a vague picture of the intentions of the authorities in Minsk. At the same time repression continues against the Association of Poles in Belarus, Catholic priests are being expelled, and Belsat Television, the only independent television which broadcasts to Belarus, has been refused registration of an office in Minsk. This is sufficient cause not to invite Alexander Lukashenko to the EU summit, in response to the appeals of the Belarusian opposition.
The Eastern Partnership means the chance for cheaper visas, better economic cooperation and financial support for civil society. These are ways in which Belarus can profit from the new policy, after many years of isolation. On the cost side, however, there is undoubtedly a cynical abuse of our good will in order to lend credibility to undemocratic rule. The Belarusian Government, which controls the main mass media and uses them not for information but for propaganda, is already announcing triumphantly that the European Union accepts the 'Belarusian model', in which democracy and freedom can be restricted. In this Chamber we must state unequivocally that Belarusians have the same rights as the citizens of other free European countries, and this includes the right to demonstrate freely in Minsk today, on the 91st anniversary of Belarusian Independence. Participation in the Eastern Partnership is intended to help them realise those rights, and if the Belarusian authorities stand in the way of this they will not be able to count on partnership and good relations with the West, especially not at the high level which Mr Vondra mentioned, and especially not when we are thinking about the Prague Summit in May, which is about the Eastern Partnership.
- Mr President, the 'catch-the-eye' procedure agreed by this House does not lay down that the President may select Members according to which group they belong to. The 'catch-the-eye' procedure, as I understand it, is for each individual Member to catch the eye of you, the President. I think it is regrettable that you have just said you will only allow three members of the PPE-DE Group to speak. That is not in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.
- (LT) Today the people of Belarus are marking Independence Day. I would like to remind you that Belarus declared itself a republic on 25 March 1918. Right now, as our discussion is taking place, in Minsk in the square opposite the Academy of Sciences, there is a demonstration initiated by the democratic opposition. Five thousand people have gathered in the square. I hope that repressive measures will not be used against them. Therefore, as before, and especially today, I would like to show solidarity with all Belarusians throughout the world, and above all with the Belarusians who have gathered in one of Minsk's squares, those who hold dear the spirit of independence and freedom.
As for dialogue with Belarus, this is necessary, but not at any price. What we, the European Union, can do without making concessions to the regime, but by encouraging dialogue with civil society, is to solve the question of the price of Schengen visas as soon as possible. The Schengen visa, which costs EUR 60, is too expensive a treat for many Belarusians. I would like to remind you that for Russian citizens the Schengen visa is half this price.
Therefore I agree with the philosophy of encouraging Belarus to make every effort to move towards democracy, and I am pleased with the decision to include Belarus in the new programme for strengthening the EU's Eastern policy through the European Neighbourhood Policy. I believe this will help Belarus to achieve stability and security, and to raise the standard of living of its citizens. The Community should continue to give financial aid to the deprived in the region, and to intervene when citizens' rights are violated. I repeat: intervene when citizens' rights are violated.
Many in the EU believe that the success of the Eastern Partnership depends on Belarus as well. Brussels needs to fill the gap left by Ukraine's uncertainty, and for this purpose even President Lukashenko may prove acceptable. The EU institutions have succeeded in killing off their own set of conditions. The Commission's work over many years has been torn down by a single visit by Javier Solana. President Lukashenko thought he was strong enough to cancel the visit of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner. Instead of accepting the conditions, Minsk has found a partner in the compromise-loving Javier Solana.
Dialogue must be used to achieve progress in human rights policy in this country, for example so that the European University for Humanistics can legally return or so that freedom of expression is no longer restricted or so that demonstrations such as today's can take place unimpeded. Dialogue must strengthen the democratic forces. Only then does it make sense. It should not stab the democratic forces in the back. Human rights issues must be addressed as the core issue at this point and the EU's human rights instruments must be permitted in this country.
On one point I believe that the Commission could require clearer and more consistent behaviour from Minsk: I refer to the situation of the tens of thousands of children who stay with European families for a few months. For many years, the Belarusian Government has acted absurdly, sometimes incomprehensibly, often cancelling children's visits at the last minute, mortifying the host families and giving another loud slap in the face to children who, often orphans from somewhat complicated family backgrounds, resented the whole affair. Let us try and come to a change of course on this as soon as possible.
I firmly believe that President Lukashenko should not come to Prague. Based on my personal experience with the totalitarian regime in Slovakia, I do not believe that a totalitarian leader is capable of transforming himself into a democrat in heart and mind. This can happen only when he is motivated by pragmatic reasons to do so. Ladies and gentlemen, we should listen more to the Belarus opposition, to Alexandr Milinkevich, and only if we can be sure that Belarus has become genuinely democratic should we lift all sanctions against Belarus.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I should like to thank you for all your contributions. As I said in my introductory remarks, in the last months we have seen steps made by the Belarus authorities that go towards the expectations formulated in the October 2008 Council conclusions. These steps are significant in the Belarus context. At the same time, the picture is mixed, and I think the debate here confirmed that. We would like see further steps, such as the changes to the criminal court, registration of other media outlets and NGOs in Belarus.
I should like to thank you once again for this interesting debate and your valuable input. We very much appreciate the interest and active involvement of the European Parliament on Belarus. We are also encouraged by your support for the EU's policy of engagement. Belarus is an important neighbour of the EU and, therefore, developments there are of concern to all of us. It is important that we send a clear and consistent message to Minsk and I am pleased that Parliament has been able to support us on this.
The question of consent is extremely complicated and, if we do not resolve it right now, it will come back to haunt us. Let me give you an example: a few decades ago, no-one knew which newspaper I read; only my family and perhaps a few of my friends. That is why - and this is especially true during a dictatorship - the secret services tried to find out, so that they could put me on file. So that they could say Mr Lambrinidis reads such and such a newspaper, so he must be a Communist or he must be pro-American. Today, every time I read a newspaper, I leave a trail. This means that private companies can compile similar 'files', can create a profile for me, of the policies in which I believe, of my eating habits and even of my health. Does the fact that I visit these websites mean that I consent to my society going back 40 years?
We urgently need to pass sensible laws which strike a balance between combating crime and protecting rights in the electronic age. This balance appears difficult but it is not. It is feasible. We need to stop dealing with cyberspace as if it were something outside our daily life, something separate. It is our life. That means that any rights or barriers which apply to the police and private companies inside the Internet must also apply outside, otherwise we run the risk of abolishing freedoms for the sake of security and, ultimately, of having neither freedoms nor real security.
Regarding freedom of speech, the Commission will continue to promote this fundamental right in international forums. New legislation in this area would not be considered as the way forward for the time being. We already have a number of binding international instruments on this subject. At this point in time, I believe that it would be useful to engage in effective reflection on the proper ways to enforce the existing legislation. So it is about implementation. This reflection should also include and help global commercial players to better define their roles and their responsibilities in the promotion and strengthening of the fundamental freedom of expression in the global online environment of the Internet.
Of course crimes on the Internet and crimes that exploit children and young people must be combated. However, the key issues in this context are, for example, the fact that the Swedish Conservative Government has adopted the so-called FRA law, a law that deals with the scrutiny of citizens who are not criminals and have not committed a crime, whereas it should instead be the citizens who scrutinise us. The report is a strong criticism of the Swedish Conservative Government, which defied all criticism and introduced this FRA law in Sweden. The authorities in Sweden now have the right to monitor Internet traffic without there being either a suspicion of crime or any risk to the safety of individuals or society.
This report, which addresses the important questions of the information society, is an important step towards creating an Internet which guarantees both security for our citizens and their fundamental freedoms. The borders between freedom and security do not end at the borders of the virtual world. He has taken account in his report of the fight against cybercrime, child pornography, identity theft and fraud, as well as copyright violation. He has tried to involve Europol and makes clear that the current laws of the physical world must also apply to the virtual world.
As several Members have already said, the Internet has brought with it greatly increased opportunities for the freedom of expression. Citizens who do not normally have access to the discussion forums of the large-scale media can stir up opinion and pursue issues. It is a new arena for the exchange of opinions that is sorely needed for political mobilisation. It provides greater opportunities for citizens to scrutinise the decision-makers. What is important is that citizens have the opportunity themselves to scrutinise legislators and other holders of power. It has brought about increased knowledge. Most of all, we also have the opportunity for exchange and to make contact with people from different cultures and different parts of the world.
Internet crime committed against children is particularly serious. In this regard we follow the Council of Europe Convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. Other groups have also been affected. I am thinking, in particular, about women who have fallen victim to the sex slave trade. The sex industry today uses the Internet and the sexual violence that many women and children suffer. In this context I would like to remind my fellow Members of the fact that they can support a written declaration that is seeking to put a stop to this violence, and that is Written Declaration No 94.
Finally, I would also like to mention the danger that we have seen with regard to the so-called war on terror. This has, on occasion, led to unreasonable government restrictions on the freedom of expression and the privacy of individuals. These restrictions have resulted in a security risk for citizens. The security services of various countries have traded the personal data that they have obtained by monitoring the Internet. This has put people's lives at risk, for example where someone is forced to flee from their home country on account of political oppression. I urge you to give great backing to this report tomorrow.
Mr President, I am fascinated on a daily basis by how fantastic a tool the Internet is, but, however much the EU might contest it, a global network of computers is not a European one. To believe that a decree from Brussels or Strasbourg could change that is quite incredible and very detached from reality. It may justifiably be argued that the EU is the wrong forum to solve the type of problem highlighted in this report. Allow me to give you a couple of examples. The report compares the right to the Internet with the right to attend school. That is a bit rich when we know that the right or opportunity to attend school is not a foregone conclusion in many EU countries.
If, by default, the filter was pre-installed in the 'on' position, it is probable that many more children - including the youngest, who increasingly use the Internet unsupervised - would be protected from unwittingly stumbling on sites which have a damaging influence on them. I appeal to manufacturers to respond to our suggestion. They should not see this as an imposition or a restriction but rather as a marketing opportunity. If I had the choice between buying two comparable computers and saw one displaying a child-friendly label, confirming that filters had been pre-installed, I as a parent would choose that product. In time, parents making such a choice would ensure that this became the industry standard. I truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry.
Finally, whilst the European Commission often speaks fine words about freedom and civil rights, I have noticed that, led by Commissioner Frattini and also with the help of the Council, countless measures have been taken in recent years that make it possible to spy on citizens round the clock and to restrict their liberties. It is high time we evaluated what has been happening and the kind of consequences being produced. Therefore, I wish to conclude with a suggestion to the Commission: I would urge it to introduce a separate Commissioner for civil rights and liberties in the coming term.
The Member States and Internet operators should keep some room for manoeuvre so that they can find the best solutions for ensuring that the rights of some do not completely prevent those of others from being exercised. Laws must apply to the Internet as they do everywhere else. The Internet cannot be a virtual space where an act that constitutes an offence in the real world is deemed permissible, and even protected simply by the effect of technology and the way in which it is used. The rule of law in our democratic societies is at stake.
That is why I think that the only thing that we should call for is a study at legal level into the multiple problems which arise from the use of the Internet. The report will therefore be useful as a catalogue which needs to be examined in depth by the legal experts, who will then implement the research work which will provide the various stakeholders mentioned in the report with the tools to draft legislation which will safeguard the principle of the rule of law as regards the use of the Internet in a democratic manner. Naturally we cannot speak of democracy when not every citizen has the right, regardless of their financial standing, to use the Internet. That is not how things stand today, but we hope that one day it will be.
Through several of the reports it has passed in recent years, the European Parliament has actually sought to answer the question 'What is the Internet?' A more relevant question today would be whether the Internet world is a separate space, as it were - a virtual world - that is not part of real life, or whether it is a part of the public sphere. This is also discussed by Mr Lambrinidis in his report, in which he states that our main task is to find a suitable balance between privacy and security.
Freedom of expression is immediately brought up whenever the restriction of Internet freedom is mentioned - freedom of expression is the right to disseminate ideas, opinions, convictions and other information, but it also involves responsibility. I would like to thank the rapporteur and hope that we will all have the strength to find the answer to this question: what is the Internet; can it be regulated, and if so, how should that be done? Since the Internet is one of the clearest signs of globalisation, our approach to the issue must also be international.
- Mr President, I am one of those people who would like to ensure the continuity of Internet freedom. The creators of the Internet had great faith in the basic goodness of humankind, and I tend to share that faith. Unfortunately, very often with the Internet, just as in any human society, we have to face the sad fact that regulations are needed to make sure that those who cannot protect themselves are protected too. The safety of an individual is a fundamental right, just as much as the right to free speech and to self-expression.
Abominations such as child pornography and paedophilia, as well as Internet fraud, must be stopped. We cannot tolerate Internet predators of any kind, and while we are discussing this topic of great interest I would like to draw your attention to a much less discussed fact: the Internet is also full of sites that incite hatred, violence and intolerance towards all kinds of minorities, among them ethnic minorities. It is an aspect of the Internet that needs our attention. We have to make sure that minorities also feel protected. It is unacceptable that many extremist groups use the Internet to instigate hatred and xenophobia.
Firstly, I wish to refer to protection of personal data and protection of confidentiality in connection with e-voting, which enables people with disabilities to exercise their rights as citizens. Secondly, I should mention protection of intellectual property in connection with artistic material which can easily be passed on via the Internet. Another matter concerns the protection of children from harmful content, such as scenes of brutality and pornography, through appropriate filters and educating parents. The fourth matter is the problem of protecting children from paedophiles and kidnappers, and also the opportunity to track down criminals using traces they have left on the Internet, such as a paedophile's address, or recordings of crimes made using mobile telephones and then posted on the Internet. If the statements made on the Internet by a young man in Germany had not been disregarded, his victims would still be alive, namely the pupils and teachers he shot. The next question, which is in fact the most important, concerns respecting freedom of speech, and here the law should be respected just as it is in every other area. Some of these problems require new technical solutions. I congratulate the rapporteur.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their committed and interesting contributions. I just want to add two points about what I said at the beginning. We share, for example, concerns on intellectual property rights and the balanced approach which is needed here. This is important for the overall evolution, or development, of the information society. Enforcement of these property rights must be duly balanced with fundamental freedoms or rights, which are enumerated in the report, including the right to privacy, protection of personal data and the right to participate in the information society.
There are many issues, but I would advocate implementation of serious policies on commitments, whether national or international. We have a directive on privacy and electronic communications, a lot of concrete action or action plans, a European programme on protection of critical infrastructures. So that is why I said we do not need more legislation, rather due and appropriate implementation, and then, of course, further evolution and improvements. Somebody rightly mentioned the telecom package. Yesterday's trialogue gives a lot of hope for final agreement.
However, to the extent that it does refer to intellectual property rights, one would think by listening to some of the speeches that it ignores them. Let me read, in particular, how balanced we have attempted to be with this report. In paragraph 1(k), we urge the to Council to 'proceed to the adoption of the directive on criminal measures aimed at the enforcement of intellectual property rights, following an assessment, in the light of contemporary innovation research, of the extent to which it is necessary and proportionate'. This is what the report states.
Political speech has to be protected, especially when it is controversial. If everyone in this room agreed with each other, we would not need freedom of speech legislation. It is when we do not - and especially to protect the speech that may particularly be angering to people like me or others - that we have those laws. This reference in the report does not talk about 'criminal' speech. It talks specifically about 'controversial political' speech. Therefore, I urge everyone to support this particular paragraph in the report and to support the report in general.
But constituents tell me they are also concerned about the dangers of the Internet. We have remarkable technology at our fingertips, but the very freedom it gives us has also left criminals free to abuse the technology. This report, in its focus on fundamental rights, will go a long way to making the Internet safer. We spoke during the last part-session on the need to tackle child pornography. Through balancing liberty and security, the proposals we have voted on today will form a further vital tool in the fight against that threat.
In a few weeks' time, once we have properly analysed all the responses, we will publish the replies, together with a statement on the feedback we received, and before the summer we will outline the different ways of addressing the problem of mass claims. This will not simply be a repetition of the four options in the green paper. Our thinking is developing further in the light of the responses to the green paper consultation. Based on the outcome of all the consultations, the Commission will carefully examine the economic and social impact on stakeholders, including the costs and benefits generated by the possible options. On 29 May we will hold a hearing to share our preliminary conclusions with stakeholders.
Concerning the initiative taken by the Commission on damages actions for breach of the European anti-trust rules, I can assure you that the Commission shares Parliament's view that these two initiatives related to collective redress should be consistent. Indeed, being consistent does not mean that different policy initiatives have to use the same tools to reach the same goals. I can equally assure you that I remain personally committed to this issue and will continue to work on it until the end of my mandate with the same energy and vigour that I have devoted to it thus far, and of course with the kind help and support of Parliament.
Above all, I think the timing and complexity of solutions is important, because you have evoked a wide range of solutions here, but it is quite clear that solutions that may involve some new European-level judicial mechanisms will clearly take far longer and potentially be more controversial than picking up some of the alternative dispute resolution measures or also using the existing consumer cooperation measures that have been put in place. I think all of us on this committee recall that, in fact, the enhanced cooperation on consumers was an aspect that was put through our committee in the last Parliament, and we would like to see that become more effective. I think there is a vehicle there that can be used to give consumers the sort of redress that we are looking for, not just in collective claims but also in dealing with cross-border claims themselves much more effectively. If we can get that sense of priority there and timing and speed to come up with the best solutions quickly, I think that is the way that I commend you to think about moving forward.
I have my mobile phone here. I have heard from many young people that they have a lot of problems because, for one contract or another that they have completely unwittingly entered into - for ringtones for example - a sum of money is deducted each month for five, six, seven, eight months. No one goes to court for the sake of EUR 5, but if a million citizens experience the same thing and an undertaking unduly pockets EUR 5 million, that is a case of unfair competition in relation to those competitors within the European Union that behave correctly. For this reason, it is very important that we address this issue.
However, it is also important for the people, for the young people, for parents, who are confronted with this to be provided with legal instruments to truly strengthen their hand. At a time when Europe is growing together, when people are shopping on the Internet, it is important that we establish these as cross-border instruments to enable them to really be used appropriately. Therefore, in the opinion of my Group, it is precisely the group action provided for by such instruments that must clearly be examined in order to ascertain whether they can be used in the European Union. However, as you have also said, Commissioner, we need to design these instruments in such a way as to prevent the extremes seen in the US, for example, from creeping in, and instead tailor them to our own legal system. We must work on this and we wish to pursue this matter further in the coming months.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am pleased, Mrs Kuneva, that at the request of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats you have been instrumental in getting the proposal relating to collective redress from the DG Competition, which to start with planned to regulate this according to the practice in the US, to be developed using a horizontal approach and to actually treat everyone equally within the European Union - small and medium-sized enterprises, consumers, workers and entrepreneurs. This is an important step forward, which we wish to support in a very constructive and positive manner.
We are aware that in many individual cases, of course, a Community claim for the enforcement of collective rights appears to be more successful than individual enforcement. However, we remain convinced that the way of skimming off summary actions that protects the consumer the most is not collective redress, but public enforcement of such claims, for example by means of a skimming claim as in the German Law against unfair competition, because individual consumers will consider very carefully whether in fact to file a collective action with a lawyer for EUR 4.99 or whether it would actually be more helpful if, for example, these claims were continually monitored at public level by an ombudsman and enforced by appropriate means. Thus, with regard to the question of how to link these two elements, I believe that we need to consider carefully how we can help consumers in the most effective way, as consumers often do not have the time to go to a lawyer, but instead want to find help quickly and easily.
The second point that I see as important - and here, too, your Directorate General has done a very good job - is that the most interesting element was a discussion in the Bavarian representation in Brussels, where in response to the question of whether, by using European legal means, we can actually rule out the type of collective redress found in the US, a representative of your Directorate General clearly said 'no we cannot'. That in our opinion means that we must not disregard this model completely. We must continue to discuss it, but to do so with great care and to include the Member States and their legal options in the discussion so that ultimately we achieve what it is we all want, and that is a real European model that is particularly attractive to consumers and that also protects small and medium-sized enterprises.
There are, I believe, enough cases like the toxic sofa case with enough compelling evidence to prove that a range of options for collective redress is needed, not only to improve access to justice, but equally to deter illegal or unfair business practices. Of course in our committee we want consumers to have access to cheap, affordable means, such as ADR, but I believe today's debate is first and foremost about identifying practical ways to give real help to our consumers and citizens, to ensure they get a fair deal, real redress and real remedies.
Staying with the positives, I also very much welcome the fact that, in its Green Paper, the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has also placed a definite emphasis on the issue of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. That is very different to the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition, which was also debated in this House yesterday and which has so far completely ignored the possibility of out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms. I think that the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has come further in its Green Paper than the members of the Directorate General for Competition.
We must not end up with sectoral instruments: one for the area of consumer protection, one of the area of antitrust law, another one for the capital market, perhaps another one for the environment, perhaps another one for social affairs, all contradicting each other, all encroaching on the legal systems of the Member States and leading ultimately to legal confusion that can no longer be managed by any practitioner. We have often seen such examples in the past. I am just thinking about the debate on the Professional Qualifications Directive, which we later also combined in a single instrument because this fragmentation was no longer manageable. The Commission should not make the same mistake again in this case. It should advocate a horizontal approach right from the outset. That is the clear position of Parliament, as will become apparent in a few minutes.
(DE) Mr President, there is a large consensus in this House that we must provide better protection for consumers, particularly where, in the case of small losses for individuals, large numbers of these losses cause a problem, because they cannot see any possibility of a meaningful individual claim. The question is how should consumer protection and the improvement of the same be organised? In this regard, I think it is very important - and I am very grateful to the Commission for this - that we should quite deliberately say that we want to examine all of the alternatives and all of the aspects of this complex issue and only after careful consideration decide on the solutions.
In this respect, I would like to stress the following. Checking to see whether there is a real need for collective redress: yes, we are doing that and we will continue to do so after the green paper. Respecting constitutional constraints: yes. Avoiding US-style class action: yes. Ensuring that damages are compensated, including all costs incurred by the consumer but, at the same time, excluding any element of punitive damage: yes, that is what we have in mind. Discouraging unmeritorious claims, as referred to by Mr Rack: yes. Promoting alternative dispute resolution schemes: of course, because this is less time-consuming, more affordable and easier for both consumers and businesses, and also respecting subsidiarity.
What I really appreciate today is that all of us recognise that we have a problem and that we are ready to address this problem. So this really is a very good starting point for the next stage of debates. As this is a challenge we face, I would like in particular to stress what Mr Lehne referred to - the common approach, the horizontal approach with Commissioner Kroes. Commissioner Kroes and myself, as well as our respective services, are cooperating very closely in order to ensure that our initiatives are consistent and produce synergies.
rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the EU, this report is the result of extensive work in the Committee on Petitions, involving Members from all political groups. I would like to thank both the Chairman and the shadow rapporteurs for their sterling work. As draftsman of the committee's opinion, I have personally been wholeheartedly committed to this matter. It has, of course, had a huge effect on the lives of tens of thousands of EU citizens living in Spain and has affected both the Spanish countryside and the Spanish economy. The report has now been approved by the committee after being adopted by a two-thirds majority. It is a comprehensive text, which differentiates between the many different aspects of Spanish urbanisation.
There is the problem of the fundamental rights of European citizens, which include the right to lawfully acquired property. The European Parliament has already committed itself to respecting these rights, and all Member States are bound by them. There is the problem of the disastrous impact of the extensive urbanisation on the environment, particularly in coastal areas and on the Spanish islands, but also in other areas such as around Madrid. There is the problem of the resurrection of the Spanish 1988 Coastal Law, which is now suddenly able to deny many people the right to live in their own homes - and in certain cases has even resulted in the demolition of these homes. Then there is the problem of the consequences of thousands of allegedly unlawful houses built with the approval of the municipalities but subsequently declared unlawful, whereby the innocent purchaser becomes the victim of corrupt urbanisation practices. Finally, there is the problem of the lack of legal certainty and appropriate compensation for the victims of the property scandals.
I have no doubt about where the responsibility for these extensive infringements lies and I regret that these violations by municipal and regional authorities have undermined attempts by many others to create sustainable development, where a healthy economy goes hand in hand with respect for the environment and for cultural heritage. The report deserves a proper debate in which all opinions can be heard. It is unacceptable that our new rules prevent this. These rules must be changed as soon as possible, particularly when it comes to reports that deal with complaints from European citizens. I ask you to reject the two alternative resolutions. Although they are based on my report, they are not impartial. They do not reflect the detailed and factual assessments that the committee has voted on.
It became clear in the debate yesterday that the majority in Parliament would be able to agree to the signing of the interim agreement, even if it pains them to do so. Many Members are hoping that, after years of deadlock, the agreement will enable a new quality of dialogue between the European Union and Turkmenistan. However, for the majority of Members it is important that we do not give the Commission and the Council a free ride. As Parliament, we need guarantees from the Commission and the Council that, if the human rights situation continues to worsen, at the request of Parliament serious consideration will be given to the suspension of the agreement. Yesterday, the Commission unfortunately only conditionally agreed and the Council did not agree at all to this demand. I therefore request, on behalf of my Group, that both final votes be postponed until we have the corresponding commitments from the Council and the Commission.
on behalf of the PSE-Group. - Mr President, I totally agree with our colleague, Mr Caspary, that we should postpone not only the final vote on the resolution but also the vote on his report - the assent report - because it was very clear in yesterday's debate that the Council in particular was not prepared to give the European Parliament sufficient opportunity and the possibility to really monitor the situation in Turkmenistan and have an impact on the situation there on the basis of such an agreement. Since we did not get sufficient guarantees, we also support Mr Caspary's proposal to postpone these votes.
Madam President, Commissioner, we are meeting at an unusual time, but still, the oral question that we put today was born in the 'A Soul for Europe' intergroup. We believe that we will find this soul in our oldest units - the regions - where people communicate with one another with their particular accent, a specific dialect or even a regional language, where the local cuisine has its own specific taste, where truly local fruit and vegetables are sold at markets, where particular folk songs still reside, where particular tales and myths originate: in short, where people feel they belong, where they feel at home.
The march of globalisation threatens to standardise so much, and many unique features will disappear. Only Europe's wonderful regions can safeguard that specialness and they must be able to rely on the protection of the European Union. The richness and variety of the regions of Europe - they were often enemies, they were occupied, they were divided up, they were destroyed by war and re-united - must be retained. The regions are like our stem cells. The European Union has maintained something like a culture of the small and is bound by human rights in this area, too.
In 2007, the Commission launched the European Agenda for Culture, which is now in its first stages of implementation. This new strategic approach to culture sets common objectives and aims to propel the economic, social and political value of culture by strengthening its transversal role. In this framework, the Commission and the Member States are cooperating under a new open method of cooperation to strengthen joint efforts in areas with a direct impact on local and regional development strategies. This will, for instance, help maximise the potential of creative and cultural industries, in particular SMEs; promote access to culture, and encourage the mobility of cultural professionals.
Feeding into the ongoing reflection, the Commission will soon launch an independent study on the contribution of culture to local and regional economic development as part of the European regional policy. The results of this study will help underline the value of investing in the cultural and creative sectors and will illustrate the links between such investment, specific regional development objectives and the Lisbon Agenda for growth and jobs. The study will also contribute to the preparation of a green paper on the potential of cultural and creative industries, which is currently under preparation and is due for adoption by the Commission in early 2010.
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by welcoming the initiative on such an interesting issue as the role of culture in the development of the regions of the European Union. Cultural heritage is an important element in the identity and in the history of the development of the peoples of Europe. Protecting and maintaining it is therefore especially important to the education of the young generation and, at the same time, to respect for the European identity. Regardless of its European, national or local dimension, cultural heritage is a fundamental value for European citizens. We all know that the focus is on the large towns where the most famous museums and monuments are to be found.
I am here also because I do actually represent one of those big cities that the previous speaker mentioned. London, as you all know, is one of the cultural centres of the EU with - as we all have - enormous history and very much to offer. It is also the centre of, certainly the British, cultural industries. So I think I have a role here to speak for the people that I represent and to fight for those jobs which, when things get bad, are very often the first jobs to go. So I very much welcome what the Commission has said about the role of cultural industries, about how we want to preserve and to build on those and how there is an economic role for culture. I feel that, very often, that economic role is ignored, and we do not talk about it; we do not even think about it, and we relegate culture to second-class status. That is not acceptable, particularly when culture can be so very important in our national and regional development. I hope that one of the things to come out of this debate today - that we take back to our Member States, and the Commission and the Council take back - is that we are very concerned about how this regional development happens, how we deal with this and the role that culture can play in that.
Also, as Mrs Pack has already said, there is the whole question of cultural diversity. I think one of the great strengths of the EU, and of the European Parliament, is that we all come together - now with 27 Member States - and are actually very different, in many ways: different backgrounds and cultures, and obviously different languages. That is just a start. Although the world is getting smaller and although people come together more, there are still these significant differences. We should be celebrating them, because those differences are at the very core of the things that we talk about. We all want to preserve our identities and how we feel about ourselves, and we need to do that.
In this context, I think we also need to take on board that we are getting people coming into our continent. We are getting people from other parts of the world - many of whom are now in second and third generations in some of our Member States - who come from different backgrounds again. I think we also need to take on board that they come with their own culture, tradition and languages. Although we integrate them and they learn our languages, they are still there with their own separate identities. That is an issue which has not been mentioned in this debate, which I think is an important one and one that we, I hope, can integrate, particularly when we talk about issues such as multilingualism, which we have had good debates on. It is an extremely important issue, and I think one we should perhaps give more prominence to than we have done, but in the context of a Europe which is changing. We therefore need to preserve our existing cultures and our existing diversity and actually absorb the new diversity which has come, and which is continuing to come, into our continent. For all of these reasons, I welcome the support that we are giving to culture and to cultural industries, support to small and medium-enterprises, which I think - in the current economic climate - are possibly going to be the backbone of what we will be looking at. If large corporations and large enterprises are losing people, making people redundant and laying people off, it may well be up to the smaller outfits - the SMEs - to pick up this slack and to actually go out there and create employment for those who can work in this sector.
Madam President, regions are an extremely important place for the development of culture. It is there that most long-lasting exchange programmes and joint projects between areas of different traditions, customs and achievements arise. Regions stimulate the development of culture, and culture - important, attractive projects and events - becomes a magnet which attracts economic investment. This is the classic knock-on effect, which is best illustrated by the effects of the splendid European Capital of Culture programme. Economic revival always follows the year of cultural events. This is understood by the numerous European cities trying to take part in the project.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me finally to draw attention to the initiative to establish the year 2013 as European Year of Learning the Languages of our Neighbours. Dynamic development of regional cooperation in Europe is often hampered by problems related to a lack of knowledge of the language and culture of neighbouring countries and regions, and a lack of ability to communicate fully. Learning the language of an immediate neighbour can be a great leap forward for mutual understanding and communication, and therefore for strengthening cultural and economic cooperation and consolidating the entire European Community.
Madam President, I think that in this debate it is worth recalling the characteristic words of Jacques Delors, the former President of the European Commission. When asked, after he had finished his term of office as President of the Commission, if there was anything he regretted or if there had not been enough of something, he admitted that the European Union and the Commission had devoted too little time to matters of culture. And I think that his characteristic self-criticism could be a signpost for us.
I agree with the speaker who spoke about the strange priorities of our Parliament. We say that culture is important, and that it is not only priorities like institutions, administration and regulations which are important. Then we speak about these things on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning. Only the debate on Thursday afternoon is about matters which could be called fundamental - about culture, because culture is in fact the foundation of European unity. Not only the culture of regions, but also national culture, because the heritage of Europe is in fact the heritage of European nations, and this is perhaps especially true of our cultural heritage.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the wording of the questions as formulated by my colleague Doris Pack. In my view multilateral support for the European regions is very important. There used to be borders in Europe separating states and nations from each other for centuries, creating a kind of psychological no-man's land. Fortunately we have now succeeded in eliminating borders through the Schengen agreement, but regions remain divided, cities are cut in half and psychological problems in particular persist, as one piece of territory belongs here or there and another somewhere else. In an increasingly integrated Europe these ancient scars on the map and in people's minds are healing safely but slowly. The fastest way to make them whole, much more effectively and practically than all of the top-down measures, is to support civic initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions. The regional institutions and ordinary people living in this or that territory know best what needs to be done to revive their region.
There are many projects whose implementation would represent both a step forwards and an impulse for further action. I come from the region of Northern Moravia, from Silesia, an area where Czech, Polish and Slovak territory all meet. And it is precisely there, in the historic Těšín region which today comprises the Czech town of Český Těšín and Polish Cieszyn, that a project has been created called "A Garden on Both Banks of the River” since there is a river flowing between the two towns which once formed a single urban unit. The project is putting in place links between the two river banks that are not only of an urban nature, but are also architectural and above all cultural. Both divided sections of the formerly homogenous whole must be linked through the cultural activities of the inhabitants. The river between the two towns and their surroundings must become a place of cultural exchange and cultural overlap. However, an important aspect of such projects is the new employment opportunities created not only during the implementation of the work but also afterwards. The service sector will certainly expand, increasing the attractiveness of the area and supporting the potential for tourism and other sorts of related enterprise. The authors of the "Garden on Both Banks of the River” project were inspired by the example of Strasbourg in France and Kehl in Germany, which were also such close neighbours that they formed a natural urban structure. Also here the Rhine flows between both cities. What is happening in France and Germany can also happen in the Czech Republic and Poland or anywhere else in Europe. There are many more examples of this in Central Europe. When we talk of the share of culture in developing Europe's regions it is precisely these projects that come to mind.
In my region lies the historic county of Northamptonshire. Part of its cultural identity, its history, its fabric, comes from its historic ties with the shoemaking industry. Shoemaking in the county was first recognised in the year 1202, when Peter the Cordwainer was almost famous within the county. In 1452 the court regulated prices and weights for various traders, including the cordwainers, and Northampton itself has served as a home to the shoe industry for all that time.
In 1841, according to the census list, there were 1 821 shoemakers within the county. The county's football team, Northampton Football Club, is still referred to as 'the Cobblers', and in Northamptonshire now we have 34 shoe factories still open, all over 100 years old. I am wearing a pair of Barker shoes today from a village called Earls Barton in the wonderful Westminster constituency of Daventry. We have a museum, we have cultural events around the shoemaking industry - and it all came before the European Union.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for accommodating me. I would like to expand our vision slightly and look to the future, not just the past. We are in a situation where we are seeing that growth cannot always be continual, rather it is restricted by the limited nature of natural resources and the limited capacity of the earth to absorb and metabolise our waste. We can no longer base our view solely on material growth - our concept of development - instead we must see development with stronger reference to quality of life: we must, in essence, dematerialise our society.
This European culture is not something new, as many people think, but it is the rediscovery of something that is much older than the nation states, Mr Heaton-Harris. Borders, at least on the continent, are mostly rather artificial. Culture is deeply rooted in regions that are often divided by artificial borders, and regional culture is of enormous importance as a link between nations. One of the greatest cultural figures was the Bohemian Forest poet Adalbert Stifter, who worked in Bavaria, Upper Austria and Bohemia and united Czech and German people. This tradition must be kept alive - the culture that is destroyed by nationalism and displacement, the culture of minorities, the regional culture, the culture of European regions that span borders and, in particular, the diversity that we will only be able to preserve together.
(PL) Madam President, people must eat, move about and take shelter from the cold or rain. These are elements of production and commerce which serve to meet fundamental needs. However, the kind of fork we eat with, or what our bicycle or the roof of our house looks like, has nothing to do with the economy, but is an expression of culture. People have a spiritual need to create, quite simply for the sake of creating. They take pride in their work when those who see or touch it express their appreciation and feel better because of it. An important point is the fact that cultural diversity is often associated with regions. We should never unify those regions and their culture - indeed, we should support that diversity. Culture is an expression of the soul of the regions. The EU would be a most uninteresting place without the cultural riches which it possesses today. Maintaining culture is expensive, and our role is to support culture. Without it there will not be an economy or happy people in the European Union.
(PL) Madam President, the cultural wealth of Europe comes from the great diversity of its regions. That diversity needs to be protected. Koniaków lace is completely different from Bruges lace. The mixture created by a superficial reproduction of ideas taken from culture leads to impoverishment. We must preserve that diversity of all forms and expressions of culture, including multilingualism and material culture, because our diversity is our identity, it is a source of creative development and of enriching cross-fertilisation. It also gives a purpose to cultural tourism. The culture of the regions needs support and protection. I would like to ask the European Commission to develop a programme for this.
(PL) Madam President, the motto of the European Union is 'United in Diversity'. That diversity makes the entire EU exceptionally attractive, and also means that we are very different from countries such as the United States. Cultural diversity is in fact based, among other things, on the huge diversity of our regional cultures, a diversity which makes those regions and entire countries extremely attractive to tourists. They are attractive to us, Europeans, and they are also extremely attractive to others, who can come to Europe to see, experience and appreciate that unusual diversity.
They say that 'the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world'. I think - and this is just my personal point of view - Greece was the cradle of European civilisation. One or two Englishmen - Lord Byron and others - did a certain amount of things. Perhaps Commissioner Borg from Malta, the country of the George Cross, could answer this question: why can we not spend a little more money on supporting the future of our culture of our civilisation? We spend I do not know how many million billion euro on this, that and the other; please - music, poetry, history, harmony. Give us a chance.
On the Green Paper I would like to inform you, as I said at the outset, that this policy document is due in the first quarter of 2010 and its aim is to launch an open consultation process. It has three main policy objectives. Firstly, to advance a more strategic approach. Secondly, to unlock the potential of European cultural and creative industries, and, thirdly, to contribute to the development of strategies aimed at encouraging better linkages between cultural and creative industries and other sectors of the economy, and thus to connect culture and creativity with innovation and the wider economy. The regional dimension will of course be fully taken into account in this context.
In addition, however, the report draws attention to Russia's disproportionately strong reaction to Georgia's armed intervention in South Ossetia and to the large-scale and unprovoked action by Russian forces in Abkhazia. The report highlights the need for meaningful dialogue on security matters. This should be a dialogue based on respect for international law and the territorial integrity of states. The report points out too that events in the Caucasus and recognition of the independence of both enclaves, Ossetia and Abkhazia, cast doubt over whether Russia really is ready and able to build a common area of security in Europe together with the European Union.
The report points to the great latent potential of possible reciprocal economic arrangements based on an equal partnership between both sides. Such arrangements could lead to mutually beneficial interdependence. According to the report, it is extremely important for Member States and the European Union as a whole to speak with one voice, especially regarding relations with Russia. It is also essential that, as they are required to do pursuant to the various European Union treaties, Member States should consult each other well in advance of any bilateral initiatives with Russia. This is particularly essential in cases that could have repercussions for other European Union countries or for the European Union as a whole.
In the report, much attention is paid to human rights and freedoms in Russia. It is pointed out that as a Member of the Council of Europe, Russia is bound to comply with the principles on which the Council is founded. It is stated that compliance with those principles is vital to the success of negotiations on cooperation between the European Union and Russia. It is deemed regrettable that Russia is averse to the introduction of effective measures to ensure that the many cases in which the Russian authorities have violated human rights and been condemned by the European Court of Justice will not be repeated.
It is worth drawing attention to one of the many recommendations contained in the report, namely that the European Union should continue to support Russia's bid for membership of the World Trade Organization. It is considered very important for Russia to abide by the commitments of membership before formally being granted membership. In particular, this involves Russia putting an end to the process of abandoning practices that have already been introduced. In this context it is worth recalling the great importance attached to the effective protection of intellectual, commercial and industrial property.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for giving us the opportunity to address, during this session, the issue of the relationship with Russia. As you certainly know, the Council discussed the relationship with Russia in depth some time ago, when we established the grounds and the rationale for the new EU-Russia agreement, and thus we consider it important that the negotiations for the new agreement are back on track. After all, Russia is our biggest neighbour, one of our key partners and an indispensable player on the international scene. Nowadays, when the economic crisis is hitting both of us equally hard, it is clear that confrontations will make neither of us any stronger.
This, in a nutshell, provided the main impetus for our decision to resume the negotiations on the new EU-Russia agreement, despite what happened in Georgia last August. The crisis and its implications continue, certainly, to overshadow our relations. The negotiations in no way legitimise Russia's conduct in Georgia, including in the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the EU has its red lines clearly set in this respect. Our support for the territorial integrity of Georgia is clearly one of them.
I would now like to make a few remarks on the external security part of the new agreement, where the Presidency also plays a role in the negotiations. It is of the utmost importance that the new agreement should contain provision to ensure effective dialogue and cooperation with Russia, and should be based on common values, compliance with the existing international commitments, the rule of law and respect for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is particularly important in relation to our common neighbourhood. Indeed, it is essential if we are to see a solution to long-standing conflicts.
Mr President, Russia is and will remain an important partner for us. Our shared interests are complex and overlapping, from economic contacts to, for example, our shared work as partners in the Middle East Quartet or, like yesterday, in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Of course, as we are all aware, we also have major differences of opinion, regarding the territorial integrity of Georgia, for example. Time and again tensions have arisen over the strengthening of our role in the neighbourhood we share with Russia. In this context, it is often wrongly asserted that we are dependent on our large neighbour. When it comes to trade and energy, we are, rather, mutually dependent or, to put it another way, we have each become an indispensible partner for the other. These, then, are times in which our relations with Russia are hugely important, and in which a unified, visionary EU strategy is absolutely vital.
As the Commission noted in its communication of 5 November, the complex and extensive nature of our relations and the many areas in which we are mutually dependent mean that we need to engage consistently with Russia, and I would also say that we need to be sober and results-orientated. The negotiations over a new agreement are without doubt the best way of putting forward a unified EU position that defends our interests, with the aim of reaching an agreement on the most important areas. As I am talking to you right now, the fourth round of negotiations is underway in Moscow.
We have now agreed on a general structure for the agreement that should form a legally binding basis for all aspects of our relations in the foreseeable future. At the same time, however, we have not set any artificial deadlines for the negotiations: in my opinion, we should take as much time as is needed to achieve a satisfactory result, because the current agreement will remain in force until that point, and there is therefore no desperate need to proceed with great urgency. We do not therefore need to wait for the new agreement before we can deal with current issues. So far, issues of politics, justice and security have been discussed, such that there is now a better understanding of our respective positions; we have now started to discuss economic issues.
It should, in any event, come as no surprise to us that the two sides have very different approaches in some areas. While Russia has big ambitions for cooperation on foreign and security policy, for example, it is currently less ambitious when it comes to economic matters. Naturally, it is in our interest, in the EU, for our trade and economic relations to include legally binding, enforceable provisions, in order to make sure that Russia accepts a system based on clear rules. This applies in particular to the topic of energy, where we are striving for acceptance of the principles of the Energy Charter, the main ones being transparency, mutuality and non-discrimination.
The agreement that we are negotiating should, of course, also be based on respect for human rights and democracy, and we believe this should be an essential component. When it comes down to it, Russia and the EU have, as Mr Vondra said, entered into the same commitments in the UN, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe. Our treaty should emphasise respect for these shared commitments and interests. Obviously, it cannot resolve the conflicts in Europe all on its own, but it should provide a framework for conflict resolution.
In parallel to our negotiations, we will continue our efforts in existing forums, in the Geneva talks for Georgia, in the 5+2 format for Transnistria and in the Minsk process for Nagorno-Karabakh. Justice and internal affairs are, as I said, of relevance to both parties in the negotiations, and they are areas where I see significant potential for mutually beneficial cooperation, particularly in the fight against organised crime and also in improving conditions for bona fide travellers. However, the possibility of abolishing the visa requirement, as Russia has called for, will only be a realistic prospect in conjunction with further improvements in other areas. For example, it would make it easier for us to cooperate effectively in general terms if Russia implemented higher data protection standards; research, education and culture also provide numerous opportunities for cooperation in the interests of our citizens, and should be taken into consideration in the new agreement.
The report we are debating today obviously includes many other proposals on which I have no time to comment right now, but they will of course come up in the debate. I would like to emphasise once again that I especially welcome the line that Mr Onyszkiewicz has taken in the report before us and in the proposed draft resolution. If further information is required following today's debate, I will of course be delighted to give the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for example, a full briefing at any time, as I did last year.
We cannot live in continuous uncertainty as to whether our citizens' supply may be cut off once again, and Russia must also recognise that it cannot use energy as a tool to avoid having to recognise the sovereignty of neighbouring States. The situation at present is one of people who have achieved independence and who are fully exercising democracy, over whom we should keep watch and over whom Russia has a duty to keep watch, just as it has a duty to provide a clear set of rules for energy exchange and unity through energy.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Onyszkiewicz for producing this important, well-written and balanced report. As the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am delighted that the report also reflects our main priorities on Russia, such as pragmatic cooperation based on a healthy market environment, an emphasis on human rights, a functioning legal state and democracy, all of which are fundamental social values for the EU, as well as an emphasis on respect for the sovereignty of all neighbouring states and for the unity of the EU.
The new agreement under negotiation must include all aspects of cooperation, be legally binding, and reflect the quality of our relations with Russia. However, if the discussions are to reflect our positions and our values we must not forget the role played by Russia in the war in Georgia last year or in the January gas crisis. We cannot permit the creation of new spheres of influence in Europe. We cannot accept the status quo, or rather the fait accompli in the Caucasus. Hence the requirement for unambiguous guarantees that Russia will not use force against any of its neighbours and that it will deal with disputes in our shared neighbourhood together with the EU. In our view it is entirely natural to invite Russia to take the first direct confidence building step.
Many fellow members today rightly emphasise the need for EU unity in relation to Russia. However, we can only achieve a genuinely unified position gradually, hence my proposal to set up a consultation mechanism within a Council framework enabling the Member States to consult each other, well in advance of all bilateral issues involving Russia that have an impact on another Member State or on the EU as a whole. Only in this way will we arrive at a genuinely unified position towards Russia and only like this will we fully exploit our greatest advantage in relation to Russia, which is our own unity.
The Socialist Group views with concern the way in which the most recent Russian Duma elections and presidential elections were conducted. We are critical of the Russian side in the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, and in the conflict between those two countries. At the same time, it is nevertheless our conviction that Parliament's recommendations must serve the improvement of EU-Russia relations and the elaboration of a new strategic partnership. This report does not serve that purpose. It was for this reason that we voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are going against the thinking expressed by the Commission. They run up against the new United States policy, if they consider that the Obama administration, in particular through the statements of Vice-President Joe Biden, has changed its style, then the European Union will fall behind the new American policy, although this would not be in our interest. So our concern is not with the criticism, but with the style.
History teaches us that nothing riles the Russians more than turning our backs to them, so it is in the interests of both Russia and the European Union to communicate, cooperate and trade in ways that build trust. Equally, it is dishonest to pretend that Russia's conduct is beyond reproach. This is a country that uses energy supplies as a weapon, a country whose cavalier conduct in the Caucasus and the Baltics sets its neighbours' nerves on edge, and a country where the rule of law flexes and bends to accommodate those in favour with the Kremlin, and turns the screws on those who are not, as today's new trial against Mikhail Khodorkovsky confirms.
There are three reasons to explain why some are prone to pander to Mr Putin. First, there are those who once sympathised with the Soviets and whose sentimental attachment to the Kremlin continues. Second, there are those who think that Russia is somehow different from other countries and the same standards cannot apply and, third, there are those who think that Russia is just too scary to scorn. None of these arguments holds water. Europe's hard Left has a history of wilful ignorance about human rights in the Soviet era. It is not only morally wrong, but politically muddle-headed for them to make excuses for Russia now that she is moving towards the authoritarian right. Moreover, human rights are universal and indivisible, or they mean nothing; so the Union should have the confidence to defend our values within our borders and outwith them.
Mr President, the Kremlin is using energy supplies as a political instrument in conjunction with the principle of 'divide and rule' in order to corrupt Europe country by country, from Cyprus to the Netherlands. This approach is proving remarkably successful. By contrast, the European Union remained surprisingly passive during the attack on sovereign Georgia. The EU's leaders were conspicuous by their absence. Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, Mr Sarkozy, the President of France, was thoroughly humiliated as the Russians totally ignored the peace agreement he had negotiated. It follows that Europe's weakness in its relations with Russia is caused by its own naivety and short-sightedness.
Austrian, German and Italian energy firms are doing business with the Kremlin on a bilateral basis. This leads directly to political pressure by Moscow on individual Member States. Germany is building a gas pipeline along the floor of the Baltic Sea in order to avoid Poland, yet Russia has cut energy supplies to Lithuania, the Czech Republic and other EU countries on more than one occasion. If Nord Stream is implemented, the same fate may befall my country, Poland. The EU's policy towards Russia must be based on the principles of unity and solidarity. This is why, if we want our relations with Russia to be effective, it is absolutely essential to consult other Member States that might potentially be affected before entering into bilateral agreements with the Kremlin.
We also support the critical attitude towards Russia because, even if Russia is now giving some positive signals, notably with regard to its willingness to conclude an international agreement on the reduction of nuclear arsenals, which are no doubt too costly in this time of crisis, it still remains completely uncompromising on other issues, particularly regarding its neighbourhood policy, reproaching the European Union for interfering in its sphere of influence. I would remind you that recently in Brussels Mr Lavrov criticised the Eastern partnership that we set up at the spring summit, just as Mr Putin reacted negatively to the gas agreement between the European Union and Ukraine.
As you know - and as everyone has stated - the issue of Georgia remains more topical than ever and still remains a bone of contention between us and Russia, which constantly uses its right of veto to prevent any deployment of international peacekeeping forces and even access for our civilian observers to the territories that it occupies and controls. It is therefore in breach of the six points of the agreement that the EU concluded with Russia on 12 August, and fails to stop the daily acts of violence along the Abkhazia-Ossetia administrative border.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing our recommendations to the Council for the new agreement with Russia. However, the text of the report does not look to me like recommendations for diplomatic negotiations. For the most part the document articulates and emphasises the need to demand, to insist, to stress, to challenge, and so on. This is a lexicon of dictation and I am very pleased not to have the role of the negotiator who is supposed to be guided by such recommendations. At the same time we acknowledge that the EU receives, aside from anything else, a quarter of its supplies of oil and natural gas from Russia. I sometimes think that we are trying to ask for secure, stable supplies of vitally important raw materials while wielding a cudgel. And what do we, the EU, bring to the negotiating table? Where is our position on human rights that we hide behind in relation to, for example, Russian-speaking minorities living within the territory of EU Member States? Where is our opinion on the reunions and actions of former members of SS units in EU countries? Or is it that we do not oppose them but rather support them, in conflict with UN findings for example? Also, how is it that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) can name both countries, Ukraine and Russia, as responsible for the problems concerning natural gas supplies to the EU, but our recommendations only challenge Russia? All in all it is rather like trying to play football with only one goal. That is not, as you will surely admit, a proper game. So let us not expect any miraculous results.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, there is no doubt that Russia now has its fair share of the global economic crisis. Just this morning I heard on the radio a penetrating report from St Petersburg on medicines that are unaffordable and thus unattainable for the average Russian citizen. The latest forecasts by the World Bank point to even stormier weather for the Russian economy. What are we to make of the gloomy prediction that, by the end of this year, more than 20 million Russians could fall below the subsistence level of RUB 4 600 (approximately USD 185)?
Indeed, Europe and Russia both face the urgent need for resolute action to tackle the crisis. Priority, therefore, should be given to joint efforts to improve the global economic climate. Yet these require mutual confidence, something I wish to emphasise as, regrettably, the Kremlin's foreign policy stands squarely in the way of this. One example is the crisis in Moldova, which continues and is becoming even more complicated, and is not being helped by Igor Smirnov. Another example is last week's renewed imbroglio in Ukraine. In short, the lack of mutual confidence stands in the way of joint efforts.
- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in the draft recommendation of this Parliament to the Council concerning the new EU-Russia agreement, which we are debating today, there are perhaps only two facts than can be agreed with. The first is that Russia has enormous significance for the stability and prosperity of Europe and the world, and the second is that we must achieve a strategic partnership with Russia based on democratic values. Otherwise I must say that the text is written in the language of a victorious power from the Cold War period, contradicting all of the basic rules of diplomacy and international relations. These rules are more about compromise, politeness, equilibrium and respect for the other side at the negotiating table. They are not about dictatorial demands and harsh condemnations. The terminology and formulation of the report are reminiscent of the letter of the puffed-up sultan to the Zaporozhsky Cossacks, who then gave him an appropriate response. The inappropriate russophobia of the text is partially redeemed by the objective statement of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which should become the guide to formulating a new document. In my view the current report is damaging both to the EU and to the Russian Federation and therefore to the interests of all citizens of the Euro-Asiatic area.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the EU-Russia summit to be held under the Czech Presidency by Czech President Václav Klaus will definitely not use this russophobic rhetoric. Not least because the Czech President does not share the mainstream EU view of the Russia-Georgia conflict. I firmly believe that in the interests of our citizens, the Council should bear in mind that Russia is and will continue to be a necessary, useful and equal partner in our geopolitical area. As has already been mentioned, a quarter of the supplies of oil and natural gas to the EU come from Russia, and half of Russian oil and natural gas goes to the EU. If nothing else then, this fact alone is a sufficient argument for trying to maintain good neighbourly relations between the EU and the Russian Federation.
(NL) Mr President, for the last two-and-a-half years, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Russia, I have been occupying myself very intensively with Russia and Europe. I have not only been working on incidents but also keeping an open mind as regards the long-term strategy. Thus, I am at a loss to understand what Mr Watson, the Chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, has just said. I have not taken a one-sided view in any of these debates, nor have my fellow Members. We have discussed the many problems involving Russia.
We need a partnership agreement, a strategic partnership, as we have just one large neighbour. We are dependent on this neighbour for our energy supply, and it is dependent on us for our funds. Since we in Europe have values to defend, however, we also discuss common values and human rights with this neighbour. Discussing just the negative aspects is not a good start to the new strategy we really need towards our large neighbour. Therefore, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response, as it contains positive elements to help us really achieve something of benefit to 500 million European citizens.
My group has great difficulties with this report by Mr Onyszkiewicz, which is why we voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. It is comprehensive, and rightly so; the agenda for relations between the EU and Russia is indeed extensive. It is true that the rapporteur has endeavoured to address all these fields in his report, for which I commend him. Yet the report takes the wrong tone. One cannot say that these relations are crucial, as the rapporteur does, and then just include examples of everything that is wrong, or going wrong, in Russia, without also noting the mistakes we ourselves have made in the past - over the last 20 years - in relation to the Russian Federation.
Russia is not a candidate country, but rather a strategic partner that wishes to cooperate in areas of common interest. This necessitates constructive, rational behaviour, and I fully agree with Mr Vondra that this must form the basis of our approach. Contrary to the impression given, the Copenhagen criteria do not apply here. I am in favour of a pragmatic approach based on interdependence. They need us and we need them. Whether it be in the field of trade, energy cooperation, climate or nuclear non-proliferation, we can find solutions only if we work together. That is the strategic interest - we persist in using the word 'strategic' in this debate - behind the negotiations on a new agreement. We must conduct these in good faith whilst also respecting Russia's interests.
Our rapporteur rightly devotes a good deal of attention to the neighbours that the European Union has in common with Russia. Here, too, the principle holds that cooperation is more productive than confrontation. We want to avoid at all costs fighting over spheres of influence. Instead, the European Union should focus on reviving a weakened Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Within this framework, we can then look at improving the approach to the frozen conflicts we still have in Europe, whether they be in Georgia, Azerbaijan or Moldova.
Not everything is hunky-dory in EU-Russia relations, of course. The report rightly discusses this. We have condemned Russia's invasion of Georgia and continue to do so. We are concerned about authoritarian tendencies in Russia. Thus the dialogue cannot only be positive and, as a member of the Council of Europe, Russia can do better. Nevertheless, with all due respect to the rapporteur, he would do well to press the reset button. Persisting with a polarising attitude now the United States Government has chosen a different approach to Russia is counterproductive. Our problems are global, and everyone's involvement is needed to solve them.
(LV) Thank you, Mr Onyszkiewicz, for your very balanced report. Russia is a very important partner for the European Union. Joint action can have a positive effect in overcoming the economic and financial crisis. This must not, however, permit us to depart from our principles and values. We must demand that Russia restores human rights in Russia, restores freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of association. We must insist that Russia's programme for supporting Russian compatriots should not be misused as an instrument for reinforcing its political influence in certain EU Member States. In order for a new agreement to be signed, Russia must fulfil its commitment on Georgia's territorial integrity. The broad agreement ought to include an energy security strategy, based on ratification of the Energy Charter. We must also demand an adequate assessment of the effect of the northern gas pipeline on the environment. Thank you.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Onyszkiewicz has spoken very lucidly on the importance of human rights in cooperation with Russia, for which I thank him. I think it is particularly important to make it absolutely clear that Europe does not value economic links, that is to say gas connections, over human rights. Normal partnerships are based on two reliable parties that trust each other. Strategic partnerships run the risk of having only limited defensibility and reliability, which is why the EU has to protect itself against unreliability. As long as Russia continues to abuse human rights so seriously and fails to reach a minimum level of democracy and rule of law, as shown, for example, by the cases of Anna Politkovskaya or Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, we cannot have a good, normal partnership.
(CS) The report from Mr Onyszkiewicz is undoubtedly one of the most important documents to appear at the close of our electoral mandate. I must underline that I am very, very disappointed by what is in the report. One of the minor issues that I can agree with is that we all consider good relations with Russia to be a key question. The concept of the report lacks balance in my opinion and I firmly believe that in this original form it will not help improve our mutual relations. I consider it a misunderstanding, to put it politely, that the report wants to entrust consultation powers to an EU High Representative. If this were to be Mr Solana then, as far as I am concerned, the man who ten years ago unleashed the senseless so-called humanitarian bombing of Yugoslavia and who, in breach of international law, is organising the break-off of part of a sovereign state, does not have my confidence. I also see a lack of balance precisely in the fact that the report criticises Russia for its programme to support Russian citizens living abroad, while at the same time remaining silent on the position of Russian-speaking non-citizens in the EU. In my opinion the report is also deliberately silent on the so-called Pole's Card problem, which breaches international law.
In the European Union, for many reasons, some of which are historical, Member States have differing ideas of our relationship with Russia and, therefore, it is not easy to reach a common position. This is one of our weaknesses and one of our problems. However, together with approaches that may be called pragmatic or realistic, in this Parliament there is increasing belief in the idea that those partners, with whom we want very close links, must behave in accordance with international law and with respect for basic rights and freedoms, especially if they are partners who belong to the great European family.
(DE) Madam President, I would like start by thanking Mr Vondra and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner most warmly for their contributions, which were much more realistic and, in our view, more to the point than Mr Onyszkiewicz's report in its current form, which I find very regrettable, as I hold Mr Onyszkiewicz in very high regard on a personal level. I therefore do not entirely understand why we have a report before us that does not use this common basis - criticism on the one hand and willingness to cooperate on the other - as a denominator, as the Council and the Commission have done.
In terms of the neighbourhood, we do not understand, and are critical of, Russia's behaviour towards Georgia, but the world has long been aware that Russia is not the only guilty part here. The only thing is that certain circles here do not want to accept that. We have to see both sides. When I look from Mrs Zourabichvili to Mrs Burjanadze, at how former allies of the President of Georgia are now in opposition to President Saakashvili and how human rights are not exactly prized very highly there either, I do ask myself why it is only Russia that is criticised, and not Georgia as well. As for the energy crisis involving Ukraine, we are now well aware, and you know this as well as we do, that Ukraine, and its internal political situation, has to bear some of the responsibility, but it is always Russia alone that is criticised.
My third point relates to human rights. We are bitterly disappointed at the attitude to human rights in Russia; certainly, we find it unacceptable. We will never remain silent when human rights are being abused. As I have just said, we must address human rights abuses clearly wherever they occur, be this in Georgia, Russia, or our own Member States. This includes the rights of Russian citizens or non-citizens, some of whom, unfortunately, face problems in certain EU Member States. That goes without saying, but we must do it to the same extent everywhere; to the same extent and with the same criteria.
Fourthly, I am deeply saddened that Russia - and its leadership - is not developing the kind of perspective of its own history that many of our own countries have developed. I am referring here to the debate we have already had, and to tomorrow's vote on the resolution on history. Russia's image would be hugely improved if it took a more critical approach to its own history, in other words if it depicted Stalinism not as a major national achievement, but as a crime that it needs to confront. Of course, there have also been very clear statements on our part, but we have to say, for all countries, for all totalitarian regimes, that we are not prepared to accept totalitarian regimes, and not prepared to accept a lack of engagement with history.
(SV) Madam President, the rapporteur is quite right to say that the EU must be able to speak with one voice on important matters relating to Russia. Unfortunately, the Russian leaders now seem to view relations with third countries as a zero-sum game. Put simply, if I do not punch you on the chin, you will punch me on the chin. Deeper cooperation between the EU and Russia would actually be a win-win situation, and we need to make Russia's leaders see this. There is a risk that the severe economic crisis in Russia will further exacerbate the attitude of its leadership in relation to close cooperation with the EU. It is therefore particularly important for the EU to speak with one voice. Whenever the EU has spoken clearly and plainly, the Russian leaders have stopped in their tracks. The Georgia conflict, the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine at the beginning of the year and the provocations surrounding the statue of the bronze soldier in Estonia all show that a united EU can cause the Russian leadership to rethink.
The question is, therefore, which of these two attitudes ensures better management of our common issues (economics, trade, energy, security, research and education), satisfying our interests while avoiding abdicating our own standards. Which one will have more impact on Russia's behaviour? Although I personally am sceptical about anybody's capacity to really influence Russia's behaviour one way or another, I still plead for an EU position combining pragmatism with integrity. In the end, although this report is nominally about Russia, in reality it concerns us too.
(PL) Madam President, it is common knowledge that in the long term the content of all agreements with Russia turns out to be more of a wish list than a set of legally binding measures. Nonetheless, it is important to maintain our efforts to regulate our relations with Russia in the best manner possible. Clearly, this cannot be achieved on the basis of current conditions, whereby the European Union's population, numbering almost 500 million individuals, and responsible for over 20% of the world's GDP has to pander to a much weaker and less populous partner. I mention this because often the interests of particular EU Member States conflict with Europe's internal solidarity. Russia has no compunction in exploiting such situations. Of course we need to deepen our economic cooperation with Russia, but we must require our partner to abide by the same standards that are binding for all EU Member States. There can be no question of condoning violations of human rights.
Russia's strategic thinking, it seems to me, is one of the most significant problems facing the European Union at this time. If we do not understand how Russia thinks about itself in the world, we shall not actually make sense of what the Kremlin says and does. There is in fact a logic to Russia's actions, but this is not the same as ours. While the EU has made the peaceful resolution of conflict the centre of its thinking, Russia has no compunction about using force, as we saw in Georgia last year.
From the perspective of power, the European Union and European integration are inexplicable, meaningless processes for Russia. In Russian eyes, the transfer of sovereignty is an abomination, not a way of securing peace. So - and it is vital that we recognise this - for Russia, the European Union is the problem. Its success is a puzzle and, above all, it is an obstacle to the maximisation of Russia's power. The European Union's future success therefore depends on recognising how Russia thinks about power. Very differently from Europe. And let there be no illusions about this.
Madam President, last month, on behalf of Parliament, I went to the administrative borderline in Georgia, established by the South Ossetian separatists following the Russian military invasion. Looking at the checkpoint, where there was no formal communication on either side, it certainly did look like a scene from the Cold War. If we are not to move backwards, one concrete step the Russians could take is to help instigate full access for the very successful European police mission to both sides of the line so that they can properly fulfil their ceasefire monitoring duties. It would be a small but concrete step to build confidence, and I call on them to do so.
I also share the view expressed by many in this Parliament that, the more European solidarity we have, the better Europe-Russia relations will be. This fact was underlined again this week by Russia's attempt to get separate, not common, agreements with EU countries on the import standards for fruit and vegetables. In this respect, I regret the speech today by the leader of the Liberal Democrats that sought to paint the Socialist position as soft on human rights. Not only will we vote to criticise Russia for breaching international election standards, for undermining freedom of expression, for the incarceration of political prisoners and for the intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders, but the speech simply demonstrates the very same point-scoring on Russia, which is itself an example of the lack of solidarity which holds us back.
Russia is affected by the economic crisis - like every country - suffering from the plummeting oil price, with a one-third devaluation of the rouble and a 75% drop in their stock market. Today President Medvedev is playing a full part in the G20 meeting in London. I believe that now the time is right, when Russia does need our cooperation and may be more open to change, if only we have the determination and the unity in the European Union to pursue it.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on reading the text of this document one gets the impression that whoever wrote it seeks not an improvement but a deterioration of relations between the European Union and Russia. If that is Europe's aim then this is an excellent document; if not then it is terrible. For my part, I think it is a terrible document. How can we picture a future of new tensions with a country we recognise as indispensable as regards our own interests? Over the next 40 years we will have to rely on the traditional energy resources in which Russia is rich. Can we do otherwise? We cannot.
I had assumed that this Parliament was capable of understanding the current situation in the world. I absolutely reject the idea that anyone here wants to trade natural gas and oil for the protection of human rights. The European Social Democrats wants to protect human rights and they have always protected human rights, but on the other hand we can see the obvious reality before us. Before the EU, before the US, before Russia and before the entire world. We will only be able to confront this reality with a foundation of good joint agreements.
(PL) Madam President, the main obstacles affecting our contacts with Russia are the latter's use of gas supplies as a means of political blackmail, its threat to Georgia's independence, the genocide in Chechnya, and its failure to conduct fair trials concerning the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko. Unfortunately, Russia has not taken a single step forward towards establishing democracy and respect for human rights, which does not augur well for future negotiations and cooperation. We must conduct a single common policy of solidarity if we want our negotiations to prove successful. This is very important in the case of such an important neighbour of the European Union.
Russia is a gangster state where troublesome political opponents, dissenters and journalists are simply murdered. The Russians even have a law that allows them to murder anyone - Russian citizen or foreign national - on foreign soil whom they deem to be a threat or a nuisance. Such a murder was carried out on my constituent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 in an act of state-sponsored terrorism. His family are still waiting for justice to be done and his murderers brought to justice or trial in England.
To those who speak of human rights, I think that the application of the rule of law, an independent judiciary and full respect for human rights - including free and independent media - are necessary to promote stability and prosperity in Russia. The EU follows the human rights situation in Russia with concern and we raise - and will continue to raise - those concerns at our EU-Russia meetings. For example, the conduct of cases such as the resumption of the Khodorkovsky trial will be a kind of litmus paper for us regarding the rule of law in Russia.
For those who speak of leverage, I agree very much that we have to speak with one voice when talking with Russia, and we need this kind of debate to shape the form of this one voice. Unity and solidarity are essential, and we will work very hard to achieve this. It is important that the Member States inform and consult each other as much as possible about bilateral issues with Russia which could have repercussions on other Member States and the EU as a whole. Parliament's suggestions in this regard are worth considering, although, given the existing Council structures, I am not entirely sure that the creation of a formal consultation mechanism is the most practical way forward. I strongly feel, however, that some kind of mechanism or common approach is needed to complement the existing framework of EU-Russia relations.
There is definitely some room for improvement in our policy towards Russia, and unity and solidarity are indeed the key words in this context. We already have quite intensive political consultation in the Council when it comes to showing solidarity, but this is also a question of political will. I agree that we need greater trust and understanding between the EU and Russia. We need to overcome the suspicions of the past and build on the real and substantial relationship which has evolved over the years, but this is certainly a two-way process and we need two to tango.
The new agreement is one way to do this. The other is through a better dialogue. Parliament has an important role to play here and I can, therefore, agree with the suggestion that the role of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee should be strengthened under the new agreement. The parliamentary dimension - like civil society contacts - has much to offer in terms of communicating and promoting the fundamental democratic principles and values on which the EU is founded. We therefore look forward to remaining in a dialogue with you as the negotiations progress.
On the one hand, being a global partner, we see Russia as a real partner, as I said before. For instance, in the Middle East, in seeking a solution between Israel and Palestine and on many other of these issues. Or on Afghanistan and Pakistan, yesterday in the conference in The Hague, Russia had an important part to play; or on Iran, or on the non-proliferation issues, or on the big global issues like climate change, which was also mentioned, or now the financial and economic crisis. Everybody is being affected by that. This is true for us, but it is also true for Russia and for many other global partners. Therefore I think we have to see this very clearly, but at the same time we also have to see Russia as a great neighbour, where sometimes we do not see eye to eye in the common neighbourhood. And we have a common neighbourhood - some of you have mentioned that, be it Moldova or Nagorno-Karabakh or, of course, Georgia. There we have to make sure we come much closer to each other, but also speak frankly on the difficulties and the differences that exist.
One of these issues is the 'Eastern Partnership', and we discussed the Eastern Partnership only last week in Parliament. The chief goal of the Eastern Partnership, which is concerned with six of our neighbouring countries, is to help those countries who want to come much more into line with the European Union on certain key issues like standards of governments, freer trade and others. In these activities, I think it is important that we have these countries as partners. But at the same time we have also said, on the multilateral platform, that we are, in principle, open to third countries like Russia on an ad hoc basis, as appropriate; certainly Russia is also a full member in the Black Sea Synergy, where regional matters are handled.
We know that Russia is a very important energy partner for us, contributing 40% of the gas we import and 20% of the gas we consume. This is, as I said before, a relationship of interdependence. Since we represent over two thirds of their export revenue - which has made a very significant contribution to Russia's economic development - it is essential that there should be no repeat of the events of last January, and therefore we are working with both the Ukrainians and the Russians to prevent that.
President Medvedev himself suggested that these exchanges continue at the 21-22 May summit, and we shall take him up on that. For instance, the attack on human rights activist Lev Ponomarev last night is the latest reminder of how difficult the situation for human rights defenders is in Russia. But let me say that the two strands have clearly been reflected in the mandate that the Council has given the Commission to negotiate. Both are there, and this is the content of our mandate. Therefore, I think the right way is to follow up on this mandate and, as I said, we are always ready to report on the follow up of our negotiations, as we have just been doing.
Madam President, I should like to remind critics of this report that it is not a report on Russia. The purpose of this report is to suggest to the Commission which issues it should raise in bilateral talks and negotiations and which areas it should focus on in particular. That is why there was no reference to the matter of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and President Medvedev's plan in this report. Any such reference would indeed have been inappropriate. That is quite a different type of issue. It should be considered in the framework of the OSCE together with the United States, but not in the framework of bilateral relations with Russia. In addition, suggestions of this nature cannot encompass our own criticism and assessment of the state of human rights in the European Union, for instance. These issues therefore need to be tabled in talks with the Russians, and they will identify our issues in due course. That is one point I wish to make.
Interdependence may be mutually beneficial but it does not have to be so. The opposite can also be the case, and it can prove a source of disquiet and conflict. We should do all we can to ensure that economic cooperation, security, energy security, respect for the principles of human rights and democracy become a positive and constructive feature of our relationship. Whether this actually comes about largely depends on the Russian side. Russia may opt for the West's values and standards. Nobody will force Russia to make such a choice or indeed any other. Russia has to choose for itself. One thing is very clear to me, however, and that is that Europe will not change its values at the request of Russia or any other country. We are being consistent or even stubborn, but not because acting differently would mean abandoning our values.
I am glad that my colleague Mr Onyszkiewicz's report calls on Russia to confirm obligations agreed to at international level, especially as a member of the European Council and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and expresses to the Russian government concern for the human rights situation and the shrinking civil society in Russia. In its report, Parliament has also drawn attention to the situation of minorities living in the Russian Federation, and calls upon Russian government agencies to ensure the survival and sustainable development of the cultures and languages of the indigenous peoples living in the Russian Federation.
The European Union's relations with Russia must be based on partnership and not confrontation. Our relations with Russia are indeed of decisive importance from the point of view of pragmatic cooperation, and our cooperation has to date benefited international stability. At the same time, that partnership must be based on the following values: democracy, the market economy, the promotion of human rights and freedom of speech; not only commercial interests and seeing one thing in connection with those interests, while obstinately closing one's eyes to other things.
In light of how important the EU and Russia are to each other, this agreement must not, however, remain simply an act of political will; we must also be able to ensure that it is implemented. Parliament's recommendation to the European Council primarily emphasises the importance of protecting human rights and the freedom of the media in Russia. As the intention is for us to progressively build on our relationship in economic, security policy and education policy terms, it is extremely important that all our partners respect European values. It is the only way for the partnership between Russia and the European Union to be developed to the satisfaction of both sides.
I believe that adoption of the report will amount to a significant step forward towards a new partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia. The key elements of such an agreement should be the subject of detailed consultation and also of hard negotiation between both parties to the new agreement. The report refers to a range of problems whose solution is particularly important to individual countries. I should like to recall the difficulties concerning trade exchange between Poland and the Russian Federation. Problems of this nature can only be resolved if the EU adopts a united stance.
In my view we should speak out against Russia loudly and clearly. We should criticise it for its shortcomings in terms of democracy, for its failure to respect civic freedoms, and for violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other states. We should call on Russia to respect the rights of national minorities and to comply with the international treaties it has signed up to. I refer to the Charter of the United Nations, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Energy Charter Treaty. At the same time, however, we should remember that partnership with Russia is a very important issue for the European Union and the whole of Europe.
Only three EU Member States have territories within the Arctic region. Nevertheless, the effects of climate change and of human activities in the Arctic region extend far beyond the Arctic itself. What happens in the Arctic has significant implications for the EU as a whole. So far, issues with an Arctic dimension have tended to be addressed by the Union within the context of sectoral policies such as the maritime policy or the fight against climate change. Although cooperation within the framework of the new northern dimension covers European Arctic areas, the Union has not developed a broad Arctic policy bringing together all the relevant individual policy areas.
Now, why is this so important? We share your concern that the Arctic region deserves international attention as never ever before. Scientific evidence shows that climate change is occurring much faster in the Arctic than in the rest of the world. In the past six years alone, the ice cap has lost up to half its thickness near the North Pole and may have passed a tipping point. That is a clear warning sign we would be foolish to ignore. The radical transformation of the Arctic is having an impact on its people, its landscape and its wildlife - on land and at sea.
So the idea of establishing a binding legal regime specifically designed for the Arctic is, unfortunately, difficult, because none of the five Arctic Ocean coastal states - Denmark, Norway, Canada, Russia and the United States - is in favour of such a regime. I therefore fear that such a proposal would at this stage not only be ineffective but could prove to be detrimental to the EU's role and credibility in overall Arctic cooperation. Rather than expending efforts on that cause, the EU's interests and objectives are better served by building greater multilateral cooperation and making better use of the existing legal instruments.
Mr President, I would like to quickly remind you about what is happening in the Arctic so that everyone understands what is at stake in this debate. At the North Pole global warming is sharpening appetites for control of the area's natural wealth. The melting of the ice will make it easier, as you have said, to exploit the vast oil and gas reserves and to open up a navigable waterway between the East and the West, which will save thousands of kilometres for cargo ships but will unfortunately prove disastrous for the environment.
These words echo the Kremlin's announcement of its intention to deploy military forces in the Arctic in order to protect its interests. Until now, regulation of this strategic area has come from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed by 150 countries on 10 December 1982. It lays down that coastal states exercise control over an area up to 200 miles from their coasts and have economic rights over the resources of the seabeds, but this area can be extended if the states can prove that the continental shelves extend beyond 200 miles. They have until May 2009 - and that is very close - to put a request of this kind to the UN.
Russia took the initiative in 2001, hence the current unrest. As far as my group, and Mr Rocard, who initiated this debate in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and who has recently been appointed ambassador for the Arctic, are concerned, given the implications for energy, the environment and military security, the Convention on the Law of the Sea is not adequate for the Arctic. The North Pole is a global asset that must be protected by a binding charter, in which the European Union must play a leading role. We want a North Pole that is clean and above all without troops.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this debate clearly follows on from our resolution last October on Arctic governance. Our group has no problem in supporting the wish for an Arctic treaty, but more in the light of a quest for a new mode of governance. The treaty is perhaps more symbolic, but what we do insist upon is working with - and respecting - the nations and, more particularly, the peoples of the Arctic. It is people, as you have already said, that distinguish the Arctic from the Antarctic.
There are already international structures - the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) rules, the International Law of the Sea - but there is a need for something more tailored and more specific. We should build on the work of the Arctic Council. Commissioner, you should join it as soon as possible and you should help build its political capacity. At all costs, we have to avoid a retreat into old-style sovereignty, territorial claims and intergovernmentalism. A new style of governance is needed for this fragile area of our globe in which every citizen of the world feels they have an interest or a stake.
We also have to prove our credentials for Arctic involvement, and our record as Europeans is not good. Our sailors and traders devastated the Arctic environment in the 17th and 18th centuries with the so-called 'rape of Spitsbergen'. It is our industrial emissions that have led directly to acute climate change in the region, and we now threaten to impose our values and our traditions on the peoples of the Arctic at this very sensitive moment. We have to listen to them and work with them because, quite frankly, their record of protecting their environment is better than ours. Our group will not therefore support the 50-year moratorium.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I live on a lovely island - a beautiful island - which has been systematically destroyed by the European Union over the last 15 years. I have seen the European Union Landfill Directive, which has had industrial waste - laughingly called 'compost' - thrown upon the land. I have seen hundreds of thousands of fish dumped in the North Sea. Near my own village, I have seen what used to be wonderful fields of wheat and barley and dairy cattle being turned over to things like miscanthus and all sorts of other biofuels, wrecking our environment and pushing up the cost of food.
The European Union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy. Thirty-five thousand wind turbines the size of jumbo jets, the biggest desecration of my beautiful island since the Industrial Revolution. And now you are looking for a remit over one of the last wildernesses in the world, the Arctic. Well, Mr President, colleagues, let me tell you that I agree with Mrs Wallis. Your record is appalling and the answer has got to be, for goodness' sake, keep your nose out of this.
The Arctic, as I said then, plays an increasingly important geostrategic role in our world, and over the past decade several critical issues have emerged in this region. We are now faced with the opening of hitherto closed seaways, a direct result of climate change. This comes as no surprise, since the Arctic is warming at a much faster rate, with an increase of two degrees in the last hundred years, compared to an average of just 0.6 degrees in the rest of the world.
Firstly, because the Arctic region is thought to contain huge energy resources - as much as 20% of the world's undiscovered technically recoverable reserves - the temptation to exploit these resources is irresistible. Secondly, the Arctic environment is exceptionally fragile. The whole of the international community stands to be affected by many of the changes that are already taking place. Thirdly, territorial disputes hang over the Arctic. We risk triggering major conflicts between countries wanting to protect - including by military means - what countries in the region consider their national interests.
(DA) Mr President, Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark with significant responsibility under Home Rule. The Arctic is not uninhabitable. It is not an unregulated landmass like the Antarctic. On the contrary, the landmasses are part of the Arctic countries and four million people already live there, a third of these being indigenous people. These people and their nations have a legitimate requirement to exploit the resources and the opportunities found in the area. It is only the sea in the middle that has international status and in this regard the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) forms the relevant legal basis. This approach was also confirmed by the Arctic coastal states in the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration. In addition to UNCLOS, there are a large number of other relevant international and regional instruments. There is scarcely any need for more governance. At most there is a need to adapt the instruments already in place. Denmark has submitted a proposal to the Arctic Council to examine the existing agreements with a view to updating them. This will and should happen in cooperation with the Arctic states and the Arctic peoples.
Mr President, the Antarctic Treaty serves as a shining global example that territorial claims by littoral states can be set aside in the interests of peaceful cooperation and scientific research. As the world confronts the issue of global warming impacting on the melting of the two caps and causing rising sea levels, and as frozen Arctic maritime passages re-open to navigation, it is important that an analogous arrangement be found for the frozen - or should I say thawing - North of the Arctic. The scramble for sovereign claims and Arctic mineral resources, as evidenced by the melodramatic planting of the Russian flag on the sea bed, must be rejected.
(DA) Mr President, as a Dane involved in tabling this motion for a resolution together with Mrs Wallis in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am not necessarily very popular. However, I think that the main approach taken by the resolution is a good one. It is good that the EU is focussing on the Arctic region. It is also good for the small nations of Denmark and Norway that the EU is involved in this matter, so that we do not only need to play with the big boys of the area, the US and Russia.
However, I would like to say that I am unable to vote in favour of the moratorium that has now been included in the resolution. Firstly, it is quite unrealistic. Russia and the US will not accept it under any circumstances. In addition, however, I also think that we need, as Mr Rovsing said, to take account of the people who live in the region and the people of Greenland naturally expect, and naturally have the right, to be able to utilise the natural resources on their territory, just as every other nation can on its territory.
There is, of course - and here I am taking up what Mrs De Keyser said - political urgency, because, after all, we are forced to do something for the Arctic. Indeed, some of the owners of part of this continent have designs on it. We know very well that Russia, which we spoke about recently, wants to establish its frontiers beyond its maritime area and extend them over the continental shelf. It is therefore an urgent matter for us, because Russia also wants to place its flags there and install military units, just as Canada does.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, who has cooperated really very closely with the European Parliament and is certainly the hardest-working Commissioner in this field: I really do appreciate it. She was also present at our meeting with the European Economic Area last week: after all, the Nordic dimension is particularly important here, and Diana Wallis, too, has repeatedly stressed that Europe bears a very particular responsibility in this connection.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I welcome this timely debate. As a result of the quest for resources and climate change, the Arctic region is on the brink of a profound change. It is not only the region itself which is likely to be affected but, as many here today have recognised, also the EU as a whole. Against the background of these developments it is important that the EU approaches the Arctic in a comprehensive and strategic manner covering a whole range of issues, such as environment, transport, biodiversity, climate change, maritime affairs, energy and research, as well as protection of the livelihood of the indigenous peoples.
I consider that the Council is now taking this issue very seriously. It broadly supports the suggestions set out in the Commission's communication. This should constitute the basis for an Arctic policy, which needs to be developed in a comprehensive manner. To those who are talking about the new treaty, there is no Council position at the moment because the Council is only now in the process of examining the Commission proposals. I would just like to recall the Council's conclusions from December. In the conclusion we say that the objectives of the EU could only be achieved in close cooperation with the Arctic countries, and the EU should enforce its participation in conformity with the current international conventions.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as I underlined at the beginning of this important debate, the European Union has to play an increasing role in protecting the Arctic environment, in promoting sustainable exploitation of natural resources and in enhancing Arctic multilateral governance. We are committed to the preservation of the Arctic and, at the same time, our aim is to contribute to a cooperative system that will guarantee sustainability, as well as free and equitable access. In order to succeed in these important endeavours, we have to cooperate closely with all the Arctic states and Arctic stakeholders, as I have said.
In this regard, the Commission proposes to promote the full implementation and elaboration of existing obligations, rather than proposing new legal instruments in order to enhance security and stability. Strict environmental management and sustainable use of resources, as well as open and equitable access. At the same time, the EU has already highlighted that, for areas beyond national jurisdiction, the provisions on environmental protection under this Convention remain rather general, and we will continue to work within the United Nations towards the further development of some of the frameworks, adapting them to new conditions or Arctic specificities. For example, a new UNCLOS implementation agreement on marine biodiversity beyond the areas of national jurisdiction could take the Arctic into account, and we have also submitted our application to the Norwegian chair of the Arctic Council. The acceptance of the Commission's application requires the unanimous decision of all the members of the Arctic Council. This decision, which is due on 29 April - i.e. very soon - might be negatively affected by an initiative that perhaps proposes an Arctic Treaty, so we should be careful about that.
The Commission wishes to express its compassion for the victims of this human disaster and its anger in the face of this tragedy. It was doubtless caused by many factors, but the primary responsibility must lie with those criminal organisations that are directing this deadly illegal traffic from the coasts of Libya and who are growing rich at the cost of human misery. The Commission finds it intolerable that this phenomenon, which seems to be intensifying over the course of the years, continues to grow. It invites all the parties concerned to mobilise their efforts to bring it to an end.
Over the last few years, the European Commission has asked the Libyan authorities several times to assume their responsibilities and to introduce effective measures, in cooperation with the European Union and its Member States. I have to say that we have offered increased financial assistance to Libya, and it is evident that the Libyan authorities need to use this assistance to improve the fight against the trafficking of migrants and others on their territory and to strengthen the controls at their southern border. The Libyan authorities must also develop a system for receiving migrants that complies with international law.
It is true that the European Union is ready to cooperate and to contribute to the interception and, if necessary, to the rescue of ships in the Mediterranean. The launch, in the coming months, of Nautilus and Hermes, the two naval operations organised and financed by Frontex, the European external borders agency, will cost around EUR 24 million. The Commission invites all the Member States of the European Union to cooperate in the implementation of these two actions. The Member States must also show solidarity in practice with Italy and Malta, which are very exposed to the flow of migrants from Libya. Furthermore, Libya must assume its responsibilities as regards the readmission of illegal migrants who have crossed its territory.
However, in addition to these emergency measures, the Commission believes that a priority action must be applied to the whole human dimension of these problems. Migrants who entrust their lives to unscrupulous traffickers are, in the vast majority of cases, people fleeing war or persecution. We hope that the events of recent days will create an awareness, in all of our Member States, of how serious this problem is, and that, together with the Member States and with the support of the European Parliament, we can thus prepare a Stockholm Programme that dedicates a large part of its priorities to this global approach to migration. The global approach is necessary for drawing up a long-term strategy for managing migratory flows that will take greater account of the circumstances and requirements of countries of origin.
In addition, this strategy must allow us to go further in the dialogue with the African partners, especially in the framework of the Rabat Process, in the framework of the relationship between the European Union and the African Union. Together we must identify joint responses to this challenge and also seize the opportunities offered by legal migration, which could, in fact, be an opportunity both for Europe and for countries of origin. This strategy must also mobilise additional resources by increasing cooperation with countries of origin and of transit in order to strengthen their capacity for dismantling human trafficking organisations and for dealing with migrants in a dignified way in which their rights are respected.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago I went to Lampedusa and Malta. I must say that I was able to see and hear for myself the tragedies of those people who are encouraged in this way by unscrupulous smugglers to risk their lives by crossing maritime areas. I think I can say that we must, in the light of this latest incident, take these problems very seriously and awaken an essential awareness in each of our Member States of the gravity, and growth too, of these phenomena, which are putting people's lives at risk in appalling conditions.
Madam President, today we feel collective grief and sorrow for the death of so many immigrants who were hopeful, desperate, and also perhaps deceived. They are innocent victims of a situation that they did not choose, of circumstances that were imposed upon them. I know the problem well. The Mediterranean and the Atlantic Canary seaboard have become pathways towards a non-existent 'El Dorado' for many people who have nothing, full of risks in transit, and frustrations and penalties upon arrival.
There are no magic recipes for finding absolutely effective solutions to such tragedies, but there are persistent and determined policies. We have to encourage solid policies of cooperation with countries of origin and of transit; cooperation and collaboration must be two sides of the same coin. We need to better organise and publicise the benefits of legal immigration in a concerted way, even in times of crisis. We must collaborate and cooperate with the countries of origin and transit regarding the control of their borders, on the basis of detailed agreements. We must also hunt out traffickers from their networks with intelligence and specialised forces, and at the same time toughen up criminal laws in the destination countries. We need to better equip the External Borders Fund; EUR 1 820 million over seven years is clearly an insufficient amount by any stretch of the imagination.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about a loss of more than 500 lives: the greatest tragedy at sea since the Second World War. The numbers are shocking, and yet Europe and its governments seem distracted. Some countries, including Italy, thought they had protected themselves by signing bilateral agreements such as the recent treaty with Libya; that is not so. The agreement in question brings together very diverse issues, such as the recognition of crimes perpetrated during the colonial era, with promises of investment, in exchange for commitments to control migration. Today, it seems the very mirage of Italian investments in Libya is attracting thousands of young people from West Africa. It is easy to predict that if the promised USD 5 billion does not arrive, then it is people who will arrive.
These repeated tragedies will not stop until the European Union has the power and the will to negotiate real partnership agreements with the countries of origin and transit that include at least three elements: reliable border controls, but also, and above all, a significant supply of legal immigration and a substantial co-development section. Without these agreements, Mr President, the cemeteries of the sea are going to keep filling up for a long time to come, despite our flimsy and powerless bursts of compassion.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what happened the other day is just the latest in a long line of shameful tragedies that have assumed mammoth dimensions. The death at sea of emigrants trying to reach our shores is without a shadow of a doubt the greatest violation of life wrought in civilised Europe. These tragedies demonstrate the terrible face of our fortress. Perhaps we ought to begin to think about our responsibility for the deaths of men and women whose sole ambition was to find a better life and escape hunger and war.
Therefore, we should probably analyse the fact that those shipwrecked in the Mediterranean are not an anomaly of a mechanism that creates illegal immigration; rather they are a foreseeable consequence of the immigration policy of the European Union and its Member States. The slaughter in the Mediterranean is caused by the philosophy of repression, by the policies of turning people back at sea, by the virtual barbed wire along our coasts, by the prohibitionist practices implemented in the immigration policy of the European Union and its Member States, including Italy and Malta. There is no other way to enter Europe; there are no legal channels for accessing the European labour market or finding recognition of the sacrosanct right of asylum. Hope is consigned to the stormy waves of the Mediterranean Sea; rights are delivered into the hands of unscrupulous boatmen, who have become the only means, or at least the most accessible means, to enter the European Union. That is the real cause of the deaths off the coast of Libya a few days ago. That is the reason why, in the last 20 years, tens of thousands of migrants have died in an attempt to reach Europe; faceless, nameless men and women reduced to food for the fishes.
Mr President, I will be brief. What is important is to take action, and I echo what Mr Deprez said. We do need to move towards this global approach, towards partnership agreements, because we will not succeed in solving the problems unilaterally. I am quite happy to admit, as you pointed out, that as Europeans we have responsibilities. Also, on the issue of legal migration, we need to demonstrate a spirit of openness. We also need to fulfil our duty to receive people who are fleeing persecution and war.
However, having said that, allow me to say, and to remind Parliament quite truthfully that the responsibility also lies with a number of third countries with which negotiation is very difficult. Does that mean that we should give up on negotiating? No! For example, we need to ensure that Libya finally has an asylum system. We need to ensure that Libya can help us to stop a number of the smugglers, who force these poor people to take unnecessary risks. I have personally heard the Maltese authorities saying that Libya allowed a number of boats to depart in awful conditions and that subsequently the Maltese navy was forced to go out and find and save the poor people who were being exploited by the smugglers. So we do need to take responsibility, but at the same time we need to demonstrate a degree of firmness in our negotiations with a number of states that are not fulfilling their international obligations.
I would like to say a special thank you to the shadow rapporteurs Mrs Klamt, Mr Cashman, Mrs Ždanoka and Mrs Kaufmann for their very constructive cooperation and strong support in the negotiations. Without the support of a unanimous committee, Parliament would not have achieved such a good result in the negotiations. I would also like to extend my thanks to the Commission, which tabled a sound initial proposal that was gratifying to develop further. My thanks also go to the French and Czech Presidencies, both of which demonstrated the will to recognise the problems that Parliament wished to address and the ability to meet Parliament half way.
The three most important results that we have achieved are: firstly, that a multiple-entry visa not only can, but must, be issued when certain agreed criteria are met; secondly, that the Member States have undertaken to enter into an agreement to represent each other, so that no one applying for a visa need make disproportionately difficult journeys in order to reach a competent Schengen consulate; and, thirdly, that a common website is to be set up to provide a unified picture of the Schengen area and to provide information regarding the rules applying to the granting of visas.
I would like to finish by saying that this reform introduces two instruments that will be very important factors in the uniform application of the Schengen rules actually becoming a reality, namely the visa information system, which is a database covering all of the Schengen countries and which will provide the consulates with information in real time on who has applied for a visa, who has been granted a visa, who has had his or her application for a visa rejected and which visas have been withdrawn, and renewed local institutional cooperation between the Schengen consulates in different countries.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Community Code on Visas will mean that, in future, Schengen visas - visas for stays of up to three months - will be issued according to established uniform criteria in the Schengen area. This step is urgently needed in a European Union with open borders. At the same time, Member States' responsibility for processing visa applications is clarified. As a rule, applicants must contact the Member State in which their main destination is located. My group welcomes the fact that the requirement and the procedure for issuing entry visas will speed up entry for large numbers of people. This way, business travellers entering the EU will be treated fairly and, moreover, holidaymakers from all round the world - by far the largest group of travellers to the EU - will benefit.
Thus we have not only made it possible to process visa applications quickly but also ensured that security screening prevents abuses. With its balance between security and facilitating entry, the Visa Information System affords Member States instant, direct access to all the relevant data in connection with the issuing of visas. Thus the examination of applications is being simplified while, at the same time, the issuing of visas will provide greater security in future thanks to the use of biometric identifiers; that is, photograph and fingerprints. The compromise struck between rapporteur Mr Lax and the Council takes account of Parliament's original position and also has the support of the broad majority of my group.
I am also pleased that, working with you, Henrik, you have shown the imagination that is absolutely necessary for a brilliant legislator, which is to put yourself in the position of the person seeking to use the service. That is the way you have approached this in its entirety. It is why you looked at the one-stop shop, the Internet, the multi-entry visas and the reduction on visas for people under 25 - I only wish I could avail myself of that privilege - and approached it by asking how we can make this work for the citizen. This is a brilliant example for the rest of the House. We often approach things by putting forward amendments, which may improve the text and may have coherence, but does it serve the citizen? That has always been your approach.
I wish to thank the rapporteur once again, and to thank the Commission for making sure that we have that principle enshrined here. I have nothing more to say other than to thank my staff and to thank your staff - and particularly Renaud, who is in the public gallery. Without our staff, we could never do the job that we do so well. It has been a brilliant three-year love affair and, like most short-term love affairs, I am pleased to see it coming to an end.
I hope that biometrics improving the reliability of the link between the applicant and the document will mean that fewer people get turned away unjustifiably. Mr Lax has worked strongly, as Mr Cashman said, on improving service for applicants, and thus the image of the EU. Ninety-nine point nine per cent of people who want to come to the EU want to do so for trade, travel and tourism, and we want them to, as it is good for business, but, if they get a poor service and are handled badly, then they will not feel warmly about the EU.
The Community Code on Visas is necessary to render more uniform the processing of short-stay Schengen visas and, above all, to improve visa-issuing service and thus the perception of the European Union in third countries. Following more than three years' work on the Community Code on Visas and complicated negotiations with the Council, it has finally proved possible to reach a compromise. Although, unfortunately, some of Parliament's demands could not be pushed through, the Community Code on Visas still contains numerous improvements, for example with regard to cooperation between Member States. Above all, it makes things easier for applicants, providing them with more legal certainty and creating transparency.
It is particularly important that any rejection of a visa application must be justified in future, and that all applicants will have the right to appeal against the rejection of their application. Regrettably, however, the visa fee is unchanged at EUR 60. Even if, in future, a larger number of people are exempted from the visa fee, this EUR 60 fee is likely to be unaffordable for a significant number of third-country nationals and thus, unfortunately, to mean that people are unable to travel to the European Union.
The purpose of the Schengen visa code is for the European Union to present a united external front, to treat visa applicants equally and set out clear exemption criteria and rules for a number of third countries. In this context, I think that it is appropriate for me to remind you that the European Union must do its utmost to ensure that its Member States are treated equally by third countries which apply visa exemptions only for certain Member States. We simply cannot have two classes of European citizens when they want to travel, for instance, to Australia or the United States.
As for the rest, I am very happy because I believe that Mr Lax has done a very good job and that he has been rewarded with very broad approval. I would like to add that obviously we also have a strategy aimed at facilitating the obtaining of visas with a number of countries, and I am placing a great deal of hope in the development of this strategy in order to facilitate the granting of visas as far as possible, in particular to young people from third countries, because I think that we have every interest in facilitating the entry of young people into Europe.
The Commission concludes from this observation of the application of the Regulation that, over the last two years, the new legislation on driving hours and rest periods has been a success. Therefore, the Commission, in agreement with the Member States, has just convinced the countries that are signed up to the AETR (international road transport) Agreement to take on these new rules from 2010. However, the Member States do of course have to ensure that these social rules are applied in a harmonised way in Europe.
Unfortunately, the European Union has not managed to do enough to reduce traffic accidents. Member States admittedly need to improve the controls which they apply to transport in transit. As rapporteur for social conditions, I have examined the first report compiled by the European Commission, which ought to have been produced twice yearly. It was unfortunately delayed, but I noticed from that report that some Member States have exceeded in practice the minimum rate of checks they had to carry out, while other Member States have not fulfilled these obligations.
Regrettably - from my point of view - I can put her mind at rest. Firstly, checks in the Member States are very permeable, with most Member States taking lightly or disregarding their monitoring obligation. Secondly, criminal prosecution in this field is still in its infancy even though the state of affairs is disastrous. When, for example, a driver who has been working for 38 hours without a break is stopped on the Inntal motorway, no one can tell me he has failed to find a car park; instead, there is often pressure from employers for drivers to keep going until they are ready to drop. This is dangerous for all the other road users. I need not go into detail about the gravity of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the functioning of the Regulation on driving time and rest periods is on the plenary agenda at long last. Since the Regulation entered into force, complaints have been pouring in about the application of this Regulation - 'unclear' and 'unreasonable' are words often heard. Action must be taken on this score. The Regulation must be reviewed, and quickly. What needs to be improved? The legislation must be predictable.
I am not advocating the harmonisation of all the sanctions. This must remain a competence of the Member States. What I am advocating, however, is a clear, predictable, reasonable system. This is the only way to get away from fines that are absurdly high and unreasonable, and involve extremely lengthy settlement procedures. There is evidently scope under the current legislation for a discriminatory approach to foreign lorry drivers, in particular, on Europe's roads, which is unacceptable. This problem quite simply represents a serious distortion of the internal market.
I believe that one of the most important aspects which the Commission must bear in mind is the value of transposing Directive No 22/2006 into Member States' national legislations and the harmonisation of national provisions drafted as a result of Article 19 of Regulation No 561/2006. Romania has fulfilled its obligations on these counts, but there are still Member States which have not completed this process, thereby resulting in problems in enforcing sanctions properly, on a cross-border basis, and in collecting fines arising from law infringements.
(PL) Mr President, we are discussing rest periods and working hours for road transport drivers in the midst of an economic crisis. Thousands of vehicles are standing idle because there are no jobs for them. The same applies to drivers. In addition, a great many firms are on the point of becoming financially unviable. Mr Jarzembowski, Mrs Wortmann-Kool and the other Members responsible for this question were quite right to raise the following three issues, namely the complexity of the system, its reliability or otherwise, and the practice of imposing the restrictions that has applied to date.
There is no scientific evidence to suggest that more flexible implementation, which in specific circumstances could even permit extending working time in a particular week, would impact negatively on road safety, especially when traffic is decreasing. By contrast, it is more than likely that the future of this sector will be threatened by strict implementation of the restrictions, and also by the imposition of the accompanying new burdens on road transport. I should like to refer in particular to the Eurovignette and to the internalisation of external costs. The subject is indeed worthy of debate and I would welcome the Commission's views on it.
I would say that this regulation is in its 'running in' period - since we are talking about transport - and that it is obviously very important for road safety and for social reasons too. I would like to give a little reassurance to those who have expressed the concerns of the profession. The Commission is aware of the gradual implementation of the regulation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. It is in contact with the social partners, the experts in the Member States, so that the regulation can gradually be harmonised in accordance with the need for interpretation.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, it is the ethical obligation of the European Union to ensure that everyone, including the children of migrants, has the right to a good education. Each child must have the right to receive an education, which must be free and compulsory, at least at basic level. Children should be able to receive a general education that fosters equal opportunities to develop their abilities - their individual power of discernment and sense of moral and social responsibility - so that they might grow as well-balanced, responsible members of society.
I have been concerned about the studies that have been recently published on the children of migrants. They suggest that in some places it has been very difficult for them to go to school and that in some societies efforts have been made to establish schools that cater exclusively for the children of migrants. The result has been, of course, that families have moved their children from the local school so that they would not need to be in the same school as the children of migrants. This is a regrettable situation and has led to very poor educational standards and school results among the children of migrants. Another outcome has been the very fast turnover of teaching staff in those schools with a high concentration of migrant children.
This is not the development we had hoped for, and we must establish conditions where the children of migrants can integrate into society in the best possible way. We should also ensure that schools have adequate resources, by which I mean quantitative resources in terms of teaching staff and also financial resources, and we need to take responsibility for the development of teacher training and, furthermore, in-service teacher training. To be able to take care of migrant children in an integrated, sustainable way we need a comprehensive approach. We also need special investment and additional resources for teacher training and the entire educational system.
I know that this is an issue that falls within the competence of each Member State, but it is also through transparent coordination on the part of the European Parliament and the European Union that we should encourage the Member States to act, because I believe that we all want migrant children to have a good education and be able to integrate into society. This way we can avoid the regrettable trend in social exclusion that we are witnessing today in the case of many migrant children. The fact is that this often leads to unemployment and, moreover, crime, as well as a lot of other unwanted consequences.
It is also a matter of concern from the point of view of the free movement of labour within the European Union that people residing in the Member States of the EU will not want to move to another country or work abroad because it is impossible to arrange good, proper schooling and good quality teaching for their children there. That is why we need to focus attention on this issue and ensure that there is an adequate system of high-level, good quality education for every child and young person in each of the Member States of the European Union.
Therefore, the report rightly emphasises the importance of giving migrant children proper help in learning the language of the host country, whilst also promoting their native languages and cultures. Participation in pre-primary education is also important, in order to achieve successful integration into education systems at an early stage and eliminate socio-economic and linguistic disadvantages. Teachers should, at all events, have the necessary qualifications, which are so important for a multicultural environment. Mobility should also be a key component of teacher training and professional development.
I am delighted that there is such a broad consensus on these issues. I believe that we are also agreed that we now need to put our good intentions into practice and really improve the educational opportunities of migrant children. Thus we should support the Member States so as to ensure a high quality of education for all and, at the same time, actively prevent the socio-economic segregation of pupils. We should assist Member States in enabling schools to master the diverse requirements so as to turn the original challenge of the multicultural society and multilingualism into an advantage for these schools.
Of course, the substance and organisation of school systems are purely national competences, and the Commission does not intend to encroach on these competences in any way. I must say, though, that the successful integration of migrant children is something that concerns Europe as a whole. We have a great deal to learn from one another, and we can learn a great deal from one another. We are sure that your report represents an important step towards showing what specific action can be taken to help the Member States in this field.
I also support the idea that the Directive 77/486/EC is outdated. Let us remember that this Directive dates from 1977 and the European Union has been changing ever since. To give just an example, my country (Romania) joined the EU over 20 years later, and I feel that this Directive does not offer a solution to our problems. The migration related issues have dramatically increased over recent years, and I support Mr Takkula's idea to amend this Directive. I would even go one step further and suggest there be a new Directive dealing with the education of the children of migrants.
The Commission's Green Paper raises a number of questions about one of the major issues which Member States are faced with at the moment: the education of migrants' children. There are a huge number of Romanian children who live with their families in other Member States and it is important for them to preserve their identity and to be offered the chance to study both the language of the country they are living in and their mother tongue. We must support tolerance and understanding and jointly find solutions to ensure education is provided in migrants' mother tongues. These children must have the same rights as other children. It is well known that their precarious economic situation can lead to isolation, dropping out of school and violence. This is precisely why we need to support Member States in finding solutions. Children are the most precious resource we have. They represent the future of our society, no matter what background they come from.
Nevertheless, I must say at this point, Mrs Vălean, that the Commission cannot endorse proposal No 23. This proposal envisages on-the-spot visits by teams of experts and the introduction of a mutual evaluation system based on these visits. I must draw your attention to the fact that such peer reviews are usually carried out under the third pillar but not within Community law. Legal and administrative traditions and the solutions chosen by Member States for the transposition of the Directive mean that the anticipated added value of such reviews would be fairly limited. After all, as you know, Member States are free to choose the form and methods for the transposition of directives.
No debate, no speakers on behalf of the groups, nothing. I would therefore like to thank, in spite of everything, and even though, I am sorry to say, they are not here, Mrs Ayala, Mrs Lucas, Mr Adamou, Mrs Sinnott, Mrs Ferreira and even Mr van Nistelrooij, who are without a Chamber, a virtually empty Chamber, at almost 11 p.m. Not bad either is the 11 p.m. slot for an issue that is of great interest and concerns millions of citizens in Europe.
I come now to the substance. For ten years our Parliament had not taken up this issue. It was time, therefore, because 10 years is an age, or almost an age, when it comes to new technology: a boom in wireless devices, mobile phones, wifi, bluetooth, base stations, high-voltage power lines. These waves are all around us, bringing undeniable benefits, which I do not for a moment question in this report, but also, it has to be said, giving rise to serious questions with regard to their impact on our health.
I do have one regret, however, and it is important because it concerns the initial paragraph of my report, calling for a review of the limits on emissions. Unfortunately, I was not supported by my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, even though - I must point this out - word for word, the same text received virtually unanimous support in our plenary session of 2 September last year, in the context of another report on the European environment and health action plan for 2004-2010.
In conclusion, it is a status quo approach that is being advocated by the World Health Organization and also by the Commission, with the rendez-vous clause for 2015 - virtually another decade - to review whether continual exposure to this cocktail of low frequency waves could cause cancerous tumours. This approach, therefore, is not the right one. It seems lightweight to me, and I hope with all my heart that, when faced with potential health issues in the future, we will not be told that it was responsible.
The precautionary principle that underpins our proposal is not a principle of inaction, but a principle of action and expertise to reduce uncertainty. It is this dynamic and progressive definition that we are defending today in this sensitive area of electromagnetic waves. That is why the alternative resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has my full support - I must make that clear. It comes back, I might add, to my original proposal of reducing the emission thresholds, as nine Member States and a whole series of regions, two of which are very close to me - Wallonia and the Brussels region - are already doing, that is, they are using three volts per metre instead of the 41 volts per metre authorised at present by the 1999 recommendation.
European citizenship does not replace national citizenship. It is an added bonus, giving EU citizens unique rights, notably the right to the freedom of movement, the right to consular protection and the right to petition Parliament and the European Ombudsman. Parliament's report takes into consideration the Commission's fifth report on European citizenship, covering the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2007. This is a unique period. Five years ago, on 1 May 2004, 10 new Member States joined the European Union. The result of that accession, especially of states from Central and Eastern Europe, was a hitherto unseen scale of inter-Union migration. The new citizens of the European Union embraced the rights granted to them, especially the right to free movement. They benefited from the opportunity to be educated abroad and, in those countries which opened their labour markets, they undertook legal work.
I trust the Commission will take into account Parliament's recommendations and will report back in its sixth report on the concrete progress made. Finally, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, the staff of the political groups and the LIBE Committee secretariat for their hard work. A special word of thanks goes to all those who participated in the public hearing on the report, especially the representatives of the NGOs. It is fitting that, in a report on citizenship, the citizen's voice, via the NGOs, was heeded in drawing up the final report.
The issue here is something very important: European citizenship. Many think 'European citizenship' is a hollow phrase and means nothing, but your report makes quite clear that that is not the case. European citizenship is made a reality by means of rights that are precisely defined in the Treaty, to wit free movement and right of residence, the right to vote and stand for election in local and European elections, the right to consular protection, the right to petition the European Parliament, the right to complain to the European Ombudsman and the right to write to the European institutions.
Aside from this, however, the Commission is working and will continue to work day to day to ensure that citizens are indeed able to exercise their civil rights, and are able to do so every day. In a large number of areas where your report, Mrs Gacek, calls on the Commission to act, the Commission is already taking action to ensure that these rights are reinforced and extended. I should like to give the example of the Commission Action Plan on consular protection, and would add that I fully agree with you that this is an area in which something needs to be done. After all, just a few weeks ago, we held an extremely instructive debate on the subject in this House that showed the extent of the gulf between aspiration and reality in the very case of consular rights.
The Treaty on the European Union states that every citizen of the Union is equal. Unfortunately, however, this principle is not always fulfilled in reality. The reason for differences is the spread of extreme poverty, social exclusion or deliberate exclusion, regions with multiple disadvantages that have been left out of the information society, and whose citizens cannot even be expected to have a common European awareness. I welcome the fact that the report specifically mentions the Roma. This minority of 10-12 million lives in segregation and experience their educational disadvantages and hopeless employment situation as a devaluation of their citizenship.
There are indications that this breakdown of society will have an effect on the European Parliamentary elections as well. The willingness of the most disadvantaged to vote is falling, since they lack information and at the margins of society there is less awareness of the significance of the fact that of all the EU institutions, it is only the composition of the European Parliament that they can directly influence. It is unfortunate that indifference is particularly great in Central and Eastern European countries, the roots of which is once again to be sought in the inadequacy of information, but another contributing factor is that the pace of catching up after the great wave of enlargement has slowed down and caused disappointment.
(IT) Mr President, I appreciate the rapporteur's suggestion, but this resolution contains too many references - not only in this point and in this footnote of the proposed oral amendment, but in many other parts of the resolution. For various reasons it refers to all the Member States and also to the very subject that you have asked to be deleted from the footnote, relating to the very subjects that appear in other parts of the resolution. I therefore believe, Mr President, and this is my proposal, that my fellow Member should ask for the resolution to be further amended and then referred back to committee for re-examination.
Mr President, this will be a very short oral amendment, which has been proposed at the request of Alexander Milinkevich and the Amnesty International representatives who took part in the conference on Belarus two days ago at Parliament. They asked to extend the demand to release political prisoners who have recently been arrested also to people who face other kinds of restrictions and harassment. That is why I propose - and I have consulted other political groups - to add to paragraph 4: 'as well as a review of the "restricted freedom” sentences imposed on 11 persons who participated in a demonstration which took place in January 2008;'.
Mr President, when three young activists are mentioned as being subject to forcible army conscription, one of them at least is the son of the opposition leader, Mr Viačorka. So it is worth mentioning that it is tantamount to state-practised hostage-taking: 'Look, be calm in your position because your son is in our army and something may happen to him.' That would be a little warning, maybe giving more security for those young men forcibly conscripted into the army.
Mr President, this is a minor correction. The text now reads 'whereas the Central European countries had the added experience of Communism'. I would like to change 'Central European countries' to 'Central and Eastern European countries', because everywhere else the text reads this way, and to replace 'had the added experience of Communism' with 'have experienced both Communism and Nazism', because, to Eastern European nations, nothing was 'added' by Communism: most of them had Communism first, then Nazism, and then Communism again.
Mr President, could I say on behalf of the ALDE Group that we would support Mrs Doyle's proposition? I think it has much merit. The House had a resolution on this issue in October of last year. To a certain extent we are repeating what we said then, but we are also saying some things that are rather stronger and, as Mrs Doyle said, they come at a critical moment when most of us in this House would want to see the EU take up a seat on the Arctic Council, and we would not wish to compromise that.
I find it extraordinary that we should have debated this resolution yesterday and that, on the contrary, the moment we table it and we call for a 50-year moratoriumon the exploitation of oil resources, the moment we call for a binding charter, and when we know that the countries have until the end of April to go to the UN to claim sovereignty over the seabed and therefore, in effect, this idea of sovereignty, accompanied by military deployment, everything should depend on what we do right now.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should postpone the Hökmark report on a Community framework for nuclear safety for two reasons: the first is that the Committee on Legal Affairs has endorsed the suggestion that there is an essential procedural problem in the Commission's proposal because the Euratom rules stipulate that the Commission must obtain the opinion of a technical committee prior to working on the proposal, and that is something that it has failed to do on two occasions. The Committee on Legal Affairs has held that this is an essential defect: in other words, it is a defect which requires withdrawal of the proposal and its resubmission by the Commission in line with the rules in force. The second reason is that there are no grounds for rushing because these provisions will apply only to power stations that may be constructed after 2015. There is therefore no reason to rush, and we have no need to adopt a text affected by such a significant procedural defect as this.
(SV) Mr President, I definitely think that we should take a decision on this matter during this part-session. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, this is a proposal that Parliament has debated before and that has now come up again, and the Council has been discussing it since 2003. It is finally time to take a decision. As regards the legal situation, the group of experts to which Mrs Frassoni refers submitted its opinion on this proposal, whereupon adjustments were made. What separates the very large majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the representatives of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is the matter of whether this is a new proposal or a proposal that we have been working on since 2003. I think that everyone else agrees that this is a proposal that we have been working on for a long time. At some point we must be able to take a decision, particularly as many countries are actually now planning to build nuclear power plants. I therefore believe that it is extremely important for us to have strong and stable legislation in place for the European Union and so I suggest that, today, we vote in favour of having a vote on the Nuclear Safety Directive this week.
Moving on, it is true that the Commission referred to the fact that the European Union wished to join the Arctic Council, and so on. For my part, I believe that, in accordance with the wish expressed by the Commission, this new resolution, which states very clearly our desire for a moratorium on drilling and for a demilitarised zone in the Arctic, is indeed a particularly important one, coming as it does at a time when the border countries are flexing their muscles - including their military muscles - in this zone, in order to claim their property and their drilling opportunities.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having consulted the political groups and the heads of the Italian delegations, on behalf of my group, I am asking you to agree to add a debate on the earthquake in Abruzzo to tomorrow's agenda. I believe that the people who have been affected appreciate the solidarity shown by the European institutions and by you in person, with the condolences expressed and the minute of silence, and they will also appreciate any financial and legislative support for reconstruction. For these reasons, a debate in the presence of the European Commission could provide national and local institutions with a lot of useful information about how much the European Union will be able to do.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament agrees with the proposal made by Mrs Angelilli. I would like to thank Mr Pöttering for his words and the House as a whole for having shown the people affected its emotional solidarity. I also believe that tomorrow afternoon's debate could produce not only renewed declarations of solidarity, but also, and above all, specific proposals, because Europe can make a significant contribution to reconstruction, as well as to alleviating the situation of crisis that the citizens of Abruzzo are living through.
(EL) Mr President, I should like, if I may be so bold, to express my dissatisfaction and curiosity, because I tabled an oral question with debate which was supported by 48 MEPs, whose support - for your information - was mustered in zero time and even now there are members who have stated that they wish to support it, and yet, much to my surprise, no one has replied to me on this issue as to why, when and on the basis of what criteria it was decided not to accept the oral question with debate.
Have I now suddenly come up against another sort of earthquake? Is it a new earthquake, does it have a different cause? I repeat once again, taking as my starting point the last fatal earthquake and the victims you referred to and - I would add - the consequential cultural damage and destruction, that we should highlight the European dimension of this phenomenon. Given that I was also the rapporteur for the only report by a European institution on the subject of earthquakes, I know full well that a great deal can and must be done at European level. I thank you and I await a reply.
Madam President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, it is rare for a liberal to promote intervention in the market through regulating prices, even if it only involves setting a maximum limit. However, in the case of mobile phone roaming tariffs, this action is necessary, and can only be carried out collectively, at European Union level. It is necessary because excessively high tariffs are raising obstacles preventing the freedom of movement and communication between Europe's citizens. Removing these obstacles is one of the European Union's fundamental objectives and one of my personal objectives as an MEP. This is why I have assumed the responsibility of being the rapporteur for this regulation, as well as for the European Parliament report adopted at the beginning of the month concerning the administrative and legal barriers raised by Member States preventing the freedom of movement of European citizens.
The current regulation is necessary, for instance, for small businessmen on a business trip who need to speak to colleagues at home to resolve a problem. It is important for journalists sending a news report via email directly from the scene of the event. It is also important for young people sending text messages to their boyfriends and girlfriends. Finally, it is important for workers abroad wanting to hear their children's voice on the phone. All these European citizens have paid and are still frequently paying three or four times more to use a mobile phone, simply because they are a couple of miles away from their own country, even though they are within the Community's borders.
When consumers come to choose a mobile phone operator, they look first and foremost at national charges or the price offered for a new mobile phone make, but scrutinise less the roaming charges. When they cross the border into another EU Member State, they are subject to these roaming charges, even when they are only receiving calls. The only option for consumers is to choose not to communicate by mobile phone. Competition among operators does not work from this perspective. The actual operator from the country of origin must pay the operator from the network being visited for carrying the signal.
Some countries, such as tourist destinations, receive large numbers of visitors during a short period of time, while others have more citizens travelling abroad. This means that there is an imbalance between supply and demand, hence the reason for the high gross tariffs even among operators. Furthermore, in some countries the cost of installing and operating mobile phone networks is higher. In addition, smaller operators or new operators who have joined the market have shown that they are often subject to discriminatory prices from large pan-European operators. Ultimately, it is always the consumer who pays.
The regulation which we are going to adopt tomorrow is a short-term solution. We cannot regulate prices indefinitely, as this affects innovation and may even affect competitiveness. This is why the regulation stipulates that the European Commission must analyse different means of regulating the market. Some of these means are even suggested by the regulation. In two or three years we will be able to debate more options when we have more information available to us. I hope that we will then be able to implement a legislative framework for having competitive roaming tariffs in the long term.
Apart from this aspect, Parliament has improved the regulation, in my view, from many perspectives. We have reduced the maximum gross roaming tariffs for transferring data to 50 cents per megabyte in order to encourage the use of this service and proper competition in the sector. We have made guidelines more transparent on advising customers about roaming mobile Internet access. We have also made the provisions intended to limit monthly bills for roaming data transfer to EUR 50 significantly more flexible for anyone wanting this feature. Text messages charged on a roaming tariff, which are sent once the consumer enters a foreign network, will also include a reference to the unique emergency number 112. We have reduced the maximum tariffs for calls received and made, while maintaining a profit margin for operators. We have also banned operators who continue the practice of charging customers abroad for someone simply leaving a voice mail for them.
We are facing here an obstacle to freedom of movement because, if you punish citizens on their phone bill when they cross a border, that is frankly not the internal market we strive for and that we wish to construct. So in order to give this freedom of movement to our citizens we have to get rid of those obstacles. Those obstacles concern a lot of people. There are roughly 150 million citizens in the European Union who use their mobile phone at least once per year for roaming while they are abroad, and they have to pay the price. It is the students, the travellers and the holidaymakers, but it is also the cross-border workers, the journalists and the businesspeople who are handicapped because of very high charges for communication.
I would just like to say a few words about what the first roaming package has achieved. On voice roaming it has achieved a 60% lower price for the citizen and 30% more traffic for the industry. The industry has also - and this is interesting - seen a steady rise in the penetration rate of the mobile phones used by citizens. We now have an average penetration rate in Europe of 119%. That is an absolute world record and, with the prices for roaming going down, that allows freedom to those citizens who utilise their mobile phone. It also gives good money to the industry because their traffic is rising continuously. At the same time, national prices are going down. Since the Barroso Commission took things in hand, domestic prices for mobile communication have decreased by roughly 35%. That is as an answer to those who say that, if we bring down the cost of roaming, national prices go up. That is not the case. The statistics show just the contrary.
Now we are going a step further: firstly, of course, on voice roaming. I think it is very good that we are continuing to bring down the caps so that the competition of the offers can take place under the caps. It is very important that we add to this SMS roaming, because every year in the European Union 2.5 billion text messages are sent. The value of the revenue from this for the industry is roughly EUR 800 million. Now, who is sending the SMSs? Mainly our young people: 77% of young people up to the age of 24 use text messages when they are abroad because it is easier and cheaper for them. So they are punished when they have to pay an extraordinarily high price with regard to the cost to the operator when they are roaming. Good: we are bringing those prices down so that text messaging will become a normal thing if you are at home or if you are in a neighbouring country. So consumers will greatly benefit from this. The reduction - which will be voted by Parliament tomorrow - means 60% for text messaging. Concerning the per-second billing for roaming calls: simply said, do not make the people pay for what they have not utilised, only make them pay for what they have really utilised. We will also bring today's hidden charge of 24% down, so that you pay only for what you have really consumed. And for data roaming, where we believe that this is a future development.
But, whilst we want to have a future development so that you can download, wherever you are, a film, a newspaper article or a photograph to send to your friends, today you have shocking bills. I have received copies of bills where people have been in another country for three or four days and have to pay several thousands of euros just because they have downloaded their favourite television show or newspaper articles, which they are used to utilising. This will stop now, also because in the new regulation there will be a cut-off limit facility which, on 1 July 2010, will become a default limit to apply automatically in order to protect our consumers.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, can I start off by first of all thanking the Committee on the Internal Market's shadow rapporteurs from all the groups, their staff and advisers? I think that in the Internal Market Committee we can all be proud that we have reached a consensus on increased transparency and ways to finally eliminate the problem of bill shock. Bill shock was not good for the reputation of the mobile operators but more importantly, bill shock was not good for consumers.
However, when it comes to price capping, I still have some concerns. We need to ask which consumers will benefit from the Soviet economics of price caps. Given that at most only 35% of consumers actually roam and that the figure for regular roamers is much lower and, as the Commissioner herself admitted, given that this legislation will mostly benefit a narrow group of privileged consumers such as Commission officials, MEPs, lobbyists and businessmen, let us hope that we are not robbing the poor to pay for cheaper phone calls for the rich.
(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate my fellow Members on the work they have done and the report they have compiled. The European Parliament is definitely working in the interest of Europe's citizens. I also recall that during the previous debate two years ago on reducing mobile phone roaming tariffs we had a very wide-ranging discussion. I am pleased that we did not have any differing points of view on this occasion. In fact, we have all quickly adopted this tariff reduction. I would like to say that I feel it is very important to continue reducing existing mobile phone charges and by larger amounts, for both outgoing and incoming calls. However, reducing text message charges is especially important.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased with the direction in which we are moving. I am referring to the radical price reductions in voice roaming calls and Internet access. This is the first step, and I think that others will follow. These are factors which may accelerate realisation of the Lisbon Strategy. This is important for the education process and for the young generation. It is important that Internet facilities be accessible to people who are relatively poor and those with low incomes. We are moving in the right direction. This news will certainly be received gladly. I would like to thank the Commission.
This directive is evidence that the European Union is able to use its common policies to forge a closer relationship with its citizens by benefiting them in the place where they feel it the most - in their pockets. This directive means more Europe, greater competitiveness and a single economy and, for me, it is one of the key achievements of the Commission's and Parliament's current mandates. The only thing I want now is for us to act in the same spirit and pay as much attention to the consumer in the next mandate, too. My congratulations once again and thank you very much.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like principally to thank the Members who have done a wonderful job. First, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Vălean, but also the rapporteurs of the other committees, the shadow rapporteurs and the spokespersons of the groups. They have made it possible, in just seven months, for a very important proposal for the free movement of citizens and the bringing down of excessive charges to become a reality. I think it is a great moment for the internal market. It is a great moment which shows to citizens that MEPs are taking them seriously.
If you would just permit, I would like nevertheless to say - with all due respect to Mr Kamall, for example - that when the market does not function, it is for the political leadership to intervene. I would like somebody here in this House to explain to me how the market can be said to be functioning when the cost to operators for transferring a text message from one country to another is less than 11 cents, while the average consumer has to pay more than 28 cents. Then something is not going well.
So if we now fix a cap of 11 cents I think there is ample room for manoeuvre; there is ample room for competition to develop. Like most of you in this Chamber I would have wished the market to have functioned, so that we did not need to do this. Well let us hope that we will not need to do so again in the future, and let us hope that after this decision the market really will function in the interests of the industry, in the interests of the citizen, in the interests of free movement, and in the interests of the internal market where every citizen can travel without being punished by a telephone bill.
I would like to say a final word to this industry as a whole. We must not allow the perception to be conveyed that the mobile phone sector ruthlessly exploits consumers. This kind of idea could be dangerous because this industry is successful, which is reflected in the creation of jobs, significant contributions to budgets and technological innovation. This is why I believe it is important for those of us regulating the market not to feel completely satisfied with the job we have done and to aim at making further improvements in order to achieve a long-term beneficial impact.
This is a very technical file and, as you are aware, technical conservation measures in the Atlantic and the North Sea originate to a large extent from existing rules. In Community legislation the measures are spread out in different regulations: the 1998 general technical measures regulation for the Atlantic and the North Sea; the additional technical measures regulation for the recovery of cod and hake; and the annual TAC and quota regulation, which also contains a number of technical conservation measures. Apart from this legal complexity, the present rules are in some cases very complicated and difficult to implement and control.
The Commission adopted the proposal for a new Regulation on technical conservation measures for the Atlantic on 4 June of last year. The proposal was drafted after extensive consultation of stakeholders and Member States during 2006 and 2007. It groups together all the relevant rules into one single legislative act, which will therefore improve legal consistency. Furthermore, the proposal seeks to simplify, clarify and streamline the various rules. Special attention has been paid to simplifying onboard inspections and reducing the costs for fishermen. There are also some additional rules to reduce discards, such as the establishment of a legal framework for real-time closures, already applied in the North Sea.
A new decision-making structure is being proposed, using a Council-level decision for the general and essential provisions and comitology for the more detailed and technical region-specific provisions, thereby avoiding micro-management at a political level. This new approach is not supported in your report, where Amendments 1, 6, 7, 25 and 26 call for Council regulations both for general and for detailed technical rules. The Commission, particularly in the framework of the CFP reform, does not want to continue with micro-management measures at a political level. However, taking into account the point made in the report regarding comitology, the Commission is ready to study any procedure which, while maintaining comitology for regional technical rules, will enable the raising at Council level of any matter which appears to be essential or political.
In line with discard policy, the Commission is proposing new rules about real-time closures and moving-on provisions for specific fisheries in order to reduce discarding practices. Both measures are considered to be efficient tools and, in order to reduce discards, are important in order to allow for a switch from rules dealing with landings to provisions on real catches. For that reason, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 4, 5, 21, 23 and 24. However, Amendment 20, only in so far as it calls for 'quantity' to be replaced by 'weight' to define the level of by-catch, is acceptable. In addition we can positively consider the second part of the amendment regarding the derogations on distance. The parameters of such a derogation, however, would have to be studied in some detail and will be laid out in the implementing regulation.
The other aspects of the Commission's proposal are very technical, with many details related to the construction and use of fishing gears in the Atlantic. I note that the rapporteur and the Fisheries Committee also addressed the very technical elements of the proposal and suggested a number of amendments, with the intention of improving the proposal. However, I must express my reservations regarding Amendments 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 22. The technical rules proposed on the basis of scientific advice have been simplified in comparison with current legislation, and will facilitate inspection on board and reduce costs for fishermen. The Commission cannot accept Amendments 18 and 19, since the provisions proposed are already in force, subsequent to a political agreement in Council on a proposal from the Commission based on scientific advice, and no new information is available to justify any modification.
On the question of discards, we have already started to take measures to reduce discards, in particular within the parameters of the North Sea and of the cod recovery plan. We will continue and we will be coming up with further proposals, for example on the banning of high grading, in a general manner which we will be proposing for 2010, and we hope that we will be dealing with this issue holistically in the discussions on the reform of the common fisheries policy with a view, I hope, to the final result being the total elimination of discards.
Mr President, I am grateful to the commissioner for one comment he made in particular, which is that he is prepared to reconsider the Commission's position on the issue of comitology. I welcome the news because Parliament has clearly shown that, throughout this debate in the Committee on Fisheries, it does not agree with the Commission's keenness - also apparent in the draft Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy - to turn to the subject of comitology excessively and with particular interest.
We call in our report for a better balance between projects earmarked for meeting political criteria and projects earmarked for bringing the country into line with the Community acquis and we call for horizontal and regional programmes to be strengthened. We also call for particular emphasis to be placed on combating corruption, organised crime and unemployment, especially unemployment among young people. We call for more funds to strengthen women's rights and equal opportunities in general. We also call for cross-border cooperation to be strengthened, in order to promote reconciliation and good neighbourly relations between beneficiary countries and between them and the Member States of the European Union to a greater degree.
My report, as voted by the committee, suggested that creditors would benefit from the introduction of a simpler, more flexible procedure, effective throughout the EU, to obtain an order to disclose information about assets which may then be made the subject of a judgement. Such measures could take the form of an interim payment order, giving the creditor immediate payment pending resolution of the underlying dispute. The report also calls for a study into how the present national systems work, with a comparison between common-law countries, such as Britain, and other European jurisdictions, and how existing arrangements could be improved. It also highlights the need to consider areas in which further cooperation with Member States could have a positive effect and how the proposals will work alongside existing data protection and human rights legislation.
It will therefore be imperative to ensure that the proposed manual of national enforcement laws and practices is kept updated and that the information is provided in easy-to-use format and that it should be written in an accessible language. It will also be crucial for the initiative to act in tandem with - rather than replacing the work of - national courts. This will require the legislation to be restricted only to cross-border cases. By bearing this caveat in mind, the enforcement of this legislation will made to work efficiently and proactively.
Overall the report will do much to help small businesses and enterprising individuals to overcome a significant obstacle to their success because they lack the resources of large enterprises to track down debtors and bring legal action against them. Small businesses are affected disproportionately by people defaulting on payments. If companies are thereby discouraged from trading abroad, this represents a real threat to the very functioning of the common market. It will be vital to protect the activities of small businesses at this difficult time because SMEs make up a large proportion of our economy.
We deal with many, many problems from across Member States but, as the statistics show, some countries use the services of the committee more widely than others, perhaps because there are members of the committee who are from those countries and therefore they attract problems from their constituents. I am always fascinated by the reality, particularly in an Irish context, that sometimes people complain that Europe is too powerful and yet, when they have a problem and turn to Europe for help, they sometimes complain that Europe is not powerful enough. I think that is quite significant.
I want to talk about some of the issues we dealt with, not in detail but just to give a flavour. Obviously, the environment is the major area where complaints come to us from citizens of the European Union. Some of the major ones relate to water quality. The Baltic Sea issue was a very contentious one dealt with by the committee in harmony with other committees of the Parliament. Property rights are a very major concern for citizens and one that I fear will become increasingly so, if I judge by the complaints coming into my own constituency office from citizens who have purchased properties across Member States of the European Union. Our powers in this regard are limited but this does not mean that we cannot speak on these matters and try and make improvements.
In my final few seconds, let me talk about the committee itself and the procedures under which we work. We would rather only admissible petitions came our way and we need to work very hard with citizens so that they know what we can and cannot deal with. I want the timeframe in which complaints are dealt with to be improved as we go forward. As one who has served on this committee in this parliamentary term, I believe that, because it deals directly with citizens, it has a great role to play in reducing what I discussed in a school in Ireland yesterday, the so-called democratic deficit. At least people come here to the Parliament and they are heard and listened to. I think that is extremely important.
Besides agreeing on the importance of working directly with citizens, the second thing I would like to pick up on is the general issue of fundamental rights. They crop up in many places in your report, whether about nationality and related rights, individual and family rights or the right of property, and as you know it very often happens that people who petition Parliament about their fundamental rights end up being disappointed. This is because such rights, more often than not, turn out to be outside the scope of Community law, as you have just rightly pointed out.
The trans-European networks have a long history. For 15 years, projects were presented, lists discussed and decisions deferred. This was and is a reason to look more closely at the whole story, to revise it and to see to what extent the goals have been or can be achieved. The trans-European networks have not always been successful. That - as so often in the European Union - is partly down to funding, and in particular to the lack of funding in Member States which still have the unfortunate habit of demanding a lot of support from the European Union. However, when it comes to payments to the European Union budget, the sack is then firmly drawn shut and very little is given out.
Well, since nothing comes from nothing, many projects did not get off the ground, and we need to look at this more closely once again, particularly in light of the more recent challenges that we are facing with regard to European transport policy as a whole. On the one hand, we are facing new challenges brought about by climate change, and we must respond to these challenges. The question of sustainability with regard to transport and the question of damage to the climate caused by certain means of transport must be asked anew again and again and must also be reflected in the actions of the Member States and the European Union.
The second point that we, of course, need to deal with very decisively is the current financial crisis, which under certain circumstances will restrict still further the ability of some Member States to take action with regard to infrastructures and the associated investments that are needed. However, enlargement has brought us completely new tasks to do in Europe that did not exist when decisions were taken on the list of trans-European networks. Therefore, after long discussions in committee, the decision was taken in favour of an approach that is intended to address these issues in particular.
Firstly, the various modes of transport should be networked considerably better than they have been up to now. This has been ignored in the past. This affects ports and the hinterland in particular, which have been neglected in recent years and now form the main focus of this report. However, this also requires the development of a core network and the network connections on which the whole system is based and with which the whole system is connected, allowing sound development in the transport sector and the continual improvement of its management. We need not only a geographical network, but also a conceptual network between the modes of transport, better intermodal links and better technical work being carried out on the networks. This relates to software rather than hardware. This is the core of our report and I hope that we can agree on this resolution, which has broad support, and that we do not take a retrograde step, as currently indicated in an alternative resolution.
There is a high degree of conformity between our proposals and the objectives and calls set out in Ms Lichtenberger's report as adopted by the Committee on Transport: that is, a more integrated and coherent network approach is necessary, in which intermodal connections such as rail connections to ports and airports and intermodal terminals, the link between long-distance and urban transport systems as well as interoperability must be strengthened so as to improve the basis for efficient, safe and high-quality services for passengers and for freight transport.
In the draft report, the Transport Committee has chosen option three, a dual layer consisting of a core and a comprehensive network. By supporting this option, Parliament confirms the need to combine traditional transport infrastructure policy with an appropriate consideration of new conditions and circumstances; the need for more flexibility and responsiveness to changing situations and more openness for the identification and support of infrastructure measures resulting for transport service requirements; and the economic and environmental challenge to promote a coordinated improvement of transport corridors through a series of small infrastructures and ITS projects.
I would also like to recall on this occasion the advantages and disadvantages of the comprehensive network. While being too large to allow for clear priority-setting and the focus of Community instruments to stimulate its implementation, it contributes to ensuring the TEN-T access function and to facilitating cohesion. It has also proved to be vital as a reference framework for various transport policy actions and legislation: in particular, interoperability in the railway sector and road safety. Elimination of the comprehensive network would therefore have some perverse effects.
Back in November, we were already doubling this 'balance of payments' facility, since it rose from EUR 12 to 25 billion, and, today, to take account not only of the reality, the severity of the crisis that we are in and that is having a particular impact on countries outside the euro zone, but also, without doubt, of the European Parliament's timetable, we propose to you that this facility be doubled, to bring it up to EUR 50 billion. This is in light of the fact that what we decided in November has already enabled support to be given to Hungary, to Latvia and, yesterday, to Romania.
There are two final elements. Firstly, as we see it, the conditionality of these loans is an element for discussion; we understand that. Generally speaking, the Commission carries out this work in harmony with the IMF. What we want is the creation of a working group to look at how these memorandums are drawn up and how they take account of the actual situation of the country in question, but also of the European Union's overall strategy, particularly as regards arbitrage between investments, purchasing power support and conditionality in terms of a strategy on environmental growth and sustainable development.
As you know, the Commission proposed last year an increase in the ceiling of outstanding loans that the Community can provide to support Member States' balances of payments. The ceiling was raised from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion, but a substantial part of this amount has already been earmarked. At the request of the countries concerned, the ECOFIN Council decided to provide balance of payments support to Hungary of up to EUR 6.5 billion in November. On 20 January it decided to grant up to EUR 3.1 billion to Latvia, and the decision to provide up to EUR 5 billion to Romania is in the pipeline.
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for compiling this report so quickly and, if Mrs Berès is listening to me, for also being sensitive to this issue, which is, in any case, a positive thing. However, this does not solve the problem of my not understanding why we should deal with this matter in such a panic-stricken manner, ignoring the views of the average MEP. After all, the EUR 25 billion available so far could comfortably cover the cost of the urgent assistance given to Romania.
This topic is being tabled for discussion for a second time within a short period. In the speech I made in November, I actually stated that the raised ceiling was inadequate, and I was right. The reason for this was not only because new Member States have presented new claims, but also because, maintaining the view I had at that time, I still think that this is a political issue. In fact, it is a disgrace that it is not the EU which is dealing with the balance of payment credits for Member States outside the euro zone which are in dire straits, but that we are handling this jointly with the IMF, somewhere between the credits for Turkey and Pakistan. This is a disgrace for Member States.
Until now, we thought that, when we joined, we would serve one god, but we now must serve several gods. On the other hand, we should also examine carefully - as we already requested the Commission to do in November, but without any success - what has led to this situation. It would have emerged then that the irresponsible economic policy pursued by the governments of the Member States affected, as in the case of Hungary, was the primary cause, which the Commission also contributed to due to the shared responsibility for economic policy or rather the lack of it. But it would also have been clear that solidarity, regarded as one of the EU's basic values, failed when it came to prevention. In actual fact, a lack of euro liquidity is also lurking behind Member States' payment problems and devaluing currencies. This is partly due to the parent companies' caution underlying the vulnerable subsidiary network at local level and partly because they did not receive any specific, practical help from the euro zone, mainly the Central Bank, unlike their fellow Member States in the euro zone which had their liquidity topped up as much as possible. But another factor making it difficult to be competitively neutral is that, because of the currencies' vulnerability, these countries outside the zone cannot benefit during the crisis from the budget incentives provided by the rest either.
I am pleased that our report raised the issue of the European Parliament's involvement. The attention of my fellow Members might mainly be drawn to the specific conditions for partial assistance agreed with the countries outside the euro zone which are in dire straits. How could it happen that, according to the agreement signed with the Hungarian Government, while completely ignoring the basic problem of European demographic trends, a drastic reduction in childcare fees was prescribed? I find it particularly disgusting that in the supplementary agreement signed in March of this year, Hungary is being forced to reduce its national top-up for direct agricultural payments. After all, this is not a social issue, but it was included in the accession treaty in order to alleviate our existing major competitive disadvantage. How did such an immoral action occur to you, together with the spineless Hungarian Government? Do you have any idea how much damage this is causing to Hungarian farmers and to the EU's reputation? We will, of course, vote for the proposal as it is a step forward, but it only marks a partial degree of solidarity. What we need to achieve is full solidarity.
(LV) Thank you, Madam President. The increase in the European Union medium-term financial assistance mechanism to EUR 50 billion is the response that is needed to the current situation. It is an important signal to European Union Member States which are not in the euro zone, and particularly to those Member States that have joined the European Union comparatively recently. The effect of the world financial crisis on the financial and economic situation in this group of states has differed, but in all of them local and international confidence in those states' financial systems has diminished significantly. Therefore, the reinforcing of the Community assistance mechanism is a demonstration of solidarity between Member States; it will have a stabilising role on the financial markets and will serve to reduce the risk of instability in the European Union's economy as a whole. The strengthening of the medium-term assistance mechanism will also make it easier for Member States to obtain the funding they need from international financial institutions. I support the proposal by the relevant committee to instruct the Commission to inform the European Parliament about memoranda of understanding with Member States in receipt of assistance, as well as the need to carry out a check in two years' time on the conditions providing the basis for assistance. Thank you.
Thus, in the Berès report - which we shall, in any case, vote for - there are two things that bother us. Firstly, what is the point of saying in paragraph 4 that we must commit ourselves to inter-country solidarity only to then point out in paragraph 11 that under no circumstances are we bound by a country's commitments? It is true that we are not bound by a country's commitments, but there is no use in pointing this out when we say that we will show solidarity with one another.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Berès for the speed with which she produced a draft report. As you know, the procedure comprises two stages. The first is the consultation; the opinion on the Council regulation. This is not a codecision procedure. At this stage, we in the committee were unanimous in our view that the increase from EUR 12 to 25 to 50 billion was the right step to take. Three Member States have already availed themselves of funds: Hungary - whose situation Mr Becsey has just discussed along with its domestic responsibility - Latvia and Romania. These European funds enable us to provide effective assistance and thus to actively support countries that have run into payment difficulties.
Yet we should not forget that, at the same time, the international institutions have decided to increase funding from the international financial institutions - the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and development banks - by USD 1 100 billion. This means we have a dual instrument. Europe has contributed to increasing this funding whilst also assuming its own responsibility. Against this background, the draft resolution on which we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted yesterday evening on the basis of compromise proposals is also suited to the adoption of Parliament's requests, requirements and demands of the Commission and of the competent Council in this regard for future legislation.
The present crisis has shown beyond all doubt that new Member States which do not belong to the euro zone can be very vulnerable to fluctuations in financial markets, often through no fault of their own. It has been said here that European Union aid should originate from the principle of solidarity. I agree entirely with this, but I would like to add that it is also required by the fact that the crisis did not arise in the new Member States and they are not responsible for the turbulence in the financial markets, and so giving them aid is fully justified.
(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Berès. We are unable to predict the duration and magnitude of the crisis, but we are constantly monitoring it. Even if we are unable to tackle the crisis ex ante, we must try to keep the response time to a minimum and achieve the maximum degree of transparency, democracy and efficiency. On the subject of time, we are dealing with the crisis like the Greek god, Cronos: the time spent handling the crisis is swallowing up its own children. We will become victims of the crisis if we are unable to take quick, effective action. The European institutional system must assume the role of Rhea, Cronos's wife, which means we have to get the better of Cronos, in other words, make the most of the time for dealing with the crisis. I would like to thank the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council for their joint decision in favour of boosting solidarity and efficiency. However, since Mr Becsey has brought up domestic political matters, I would also like, if I may, to draw attention to the fact that while tackling this crisis, it is the duty of MEPs to work together in national parliaments. What we need is not division between the government party and the opposition, but help from every party involved in managing the crisis. This applies to my country, Hungary, and to every other country too.
(RO) I would like to thank the European Commission, the Council and European Parliament for the efficiency with which they have devised this measure. Many Member States which are not part of the euro zone will benefit from this top-up to the intervention fund for balance of payment requirements, including Romania. Without this measure, the situation triggered by the economic and financial crisis would have been much more difficult in these Member States outside the euro zone. Given also that it has been shown once again that the Member States which use the euro have weathered the financial crisis better, I would suggest that in the memoranda of understanding which will be signed between the Commission and Member States to be able to use these funds, Member States should be reminded, especially the new ones, that they have an obligation to take every measure to join the euro zone.
- (LT) I would like to draw attention to an unpleasant fact which is hiding behind fine words. In reality, Europe is now split in two: the euro zone and the non-euro zone. An hour ago we discussed the control of financial markets; it is obvious that the aim is to ensure the movement of capital and the activities of financial groups uniformly throughout the whole of Europe. This means macroeconomic management is left in national hands and if there are problems, countries are left to solve those problems themselves. This is not the sort of attitude that will help us strengthen the common market. We need common macroeconomic management and this will be achieved if we support the proposal of the de Larosière Group. However, we need this macroeconomic management on a European scale, not just within the euro zone, and we need it now. I think that one of the European Parliament's proposals for the ECOFIN meeting should be to discuss macroeconomic management not just on the basis of the euro zone, but at European Union level.
A number of speakers raised the question of the legal base on which this particular provision has been made. The use of Article 100 as the basis for a new instrument on EU balance of payment assistance has been considered by the Commission. However, due to the urgency of the matter and to ensure continuity, it has been fair to stick to the current legal instruments and limit the revision of Regulation (EC) No 332/2002, establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for non-euro-area Member States to a minimum, i.e. to the increase in the ceiling as agreed by the European Council, and to some necessary technical improvements that appear necessary on the basis of the experience gained with the implementation of the balance of payments facility since last autumn. A number of speakers raised that particular point.
In July 2006 the Commission presented a strategy the objective of which was to reduce the general risk and adverse impact of pesticides on human health and the environment. The last element of that strategy is the proposal for a directive on machinery for pesticide application, amending Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery. The directive sets out the requirements with which the machinery for application should comply in order to limit the adverse effects of pesticides on the environment, the operator and the surroundings. Establishing these requirements will reduce the differences between regulations and the procedures followed in some countries of the Community concerning the application of pesticides, ensure a uniform level of environmental protection in the Community, and enable free flow of these machines in the EU market, which is especially significant for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are most often the producers of this type of equipment.
The draft of the proposal and suggested amendments were the subject of discussion during workshops, at meetings with representatives of the Council, the Commission, shadow rapporteurs and interested parties, and during tri-partite talks. In view of the large technical differences between different types of machine - from simple, hand-operated ones to those operated by qualified personnel - some of the amendments were not adopted and it was decided that they will be contained in standards developed by the European Committee for Standardization at the request of the Commission. Thanks to this a consensus was achieved, Amendment 39 was adopted, and this position has been confirmed by the Council.
The Commission would like to make the following statement: 'To support the essential requirements included in Section 2.4 of Annex I, the Commission will mandate CEN to develop harmonised standards for each category of machinery for pesticide application, based on the best available techniques for preventing unintended exposure of the environment to pesticides. In particular the mandate will require the standards to provide criteria and technical specifications for the fitting of mechanical shielding, tunnel spraying and air-assistance systems for spraying for preventing contamination of the water source during filling and emptying and precise specifications for the manufacturer's instructions to prevent drift of pesticides, taking account of all the relevant parameters, such as nozzle pressure, boom height, wind speed, air temperature and humidity, and driving speed.'
The Commission is aware of Parliament's concerns regarding the possibility of suspending the agreements. I recall the statement by my colleague, Ms Ferrero-Waldner, at the debate last month that both the Interim Trade Agreement (Article 1) and the PCA (Article 2) contain human rights clauses which constitute an essential element of those agreements. As well as these provisions, Article 28 of the ITA and Article 94 of the PCA will enable each side to take appropriate measures in case of grave violations of the agreements. In the Commission's view, these measures could also include the suspension of the agreements.
Mr Søndergaard, I can confirm on behalf of the Presidency that the Council was indeed invited to attend the debate on this item. Despite this, it is with the Presidency's sincere regret and on behalf of Parliament as a whole that I note the Council's absence; I believe this was also the case this morning, when the President of Parliament welcomed the Council but received no reply whatsoever. Although I regret this, I can do nothing to remedy the situation and we are thus obliged to hold the debate as planned. I therefore invite you to take the floor again as rapporteur, to introduce the debate on this report and on this item.
rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I very much regret the fact that we are going to conduct this debate in the absence of the Council - the very Council whose budget we are about to discuss. It is absurd, of course, that the Council should simply choose to ignore this debate in this way, given that the Committee on Budgetary Control has voted by a very large majority to recommend that Parliament postpone its discharge decision for the Council's 2007 budget.
Why have we done this? Is it because we suspect some fraud or irregularity? The answer is 'no', because we have no indication or information which points in that direction. So why, then, have we done it? We have proposed that the grant of the Council's discharge be postponed, because our committee has not yet received any official reply from the Council regarding a series of ambiguities in the budget. These ambiguities may well, in fact, be the result of misunderstandings, but the Council has declined to clear up these misunderstandings. Naturally, it could have done so by replying to our questions.
In the annex to the report we have listed a number of questions, some of which are actually quite straightforward, and it should not be difficult to provide an answer to them. For example: how many accounts outside the budget did the Council have in 2007? What funds did they cover and what were they spent on? Another question is: can the Council offer any explanation as to how its own internal auditor could have come to the conclusion that there were shortcomings in the control and verification of invoices? Yet another one: is there any explanation as to why it has been necessary to transfer substantial amounts from the translation budget line to the travel budget line, year after year? Despite repeated calls from me, as rapporteur, and from the committee as a whole, the Council has to date given no official reply to these questions.
The second reason is interinstitutional equilibrium. It is important that we do not do something that we cannot do as a Parliament, but it is also very important to say that it is our right to have a view, to have an opinion on the Council's accounts, when these accounts are operational and where these operational accounts must be accounted for. This is the democratic principle and this is what we are about to do. So we are not saying we want to do something else. We are saying we want to do our duty.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Thank you, Mr Søndergaard, your report is a gem, covering, as it does, all the pertinent points. I should, however, like to ask the President and this Parliament's Bureau to take note of the Council's absence and not to leave it at that. We should not let them run rings around us. I should like to urge the Bureau to consider sending the Council a very firm letter of protest with the message that this is unacceptable.
Indeed, as things stand at the moment, we refuse to grant an extension. This is beyond question now. We cannot grant discharge to the Council. This is not so much about fraud, as it is about a matter of principle, namely transparency. EUR 650 million from the European budget is managed by Mr Solana in the area of defence, security and foreign policy, but without any form of monitoring. This is not acceptable in a democracy. It has to stop. Hence the justified demands for an activities report, transparency and clarity.
That is not all, however. As a rapporteur on VAT fraud, in my report that was approved on 4 December, I clearly asked the Council to answer a number of questions. We are now four or five months down the line, and this period has been marked by a deafening silence from the Council, while the estimated fraud involved is between EUR 60 and 100 billion annually. The Council must act. Coordination is what is needed in the fight against VAT fraud, and as long as there is no willingness to act on their part, I will not grant discharge to the Council.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, I, too, would like to ask the same question, and that is where is the Council in this debate? It is, of course, the Council and its budget management that we are to scrutinise. I find it remarkable that no one from the Council is here at this point to answer our questions. We in the Committee on Budgetary Control, in particular our draftsman Mr Søndergaard, have put several question marks against the Council of Ministers' management of its finances. We have pointed it out on numerous occasions, but have not received any satisfactory answers.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, we are facing one of the really important, fundamental questions here. You could say that, as a representative of a eurosceptic party, I believe that it should always be the Council that dominates European cooperation and that this Parliament should concentrate on the internal market and cross-border environmental issues. However, there is a third issue that has now come to the fore. The Council and this Parliament are, in principle, equally responsible for the budget and the uses to which taxpayers' money is put. Now what is, in my view, an unprecedented event has occurred in that the Council is keeping the uses to which the money is put a secret. We therefore have no transparency. Citizens are not able to say 'I accept that because I know what the money has been used for'. Therefore, I would say - and as far as I understand, all the speakers in this Parliament are in agreement for once - that there can be no question of granting discharge to the Council until we know where the money has gone.
(DE) Mr President, I rise to speak here as a passionate pro-European, and am convinced that we are currently receiving a lesson in what EU democracy should not look like. The fact that the Council does not deem it in any way necessary to meet Parliament's very clear criticisms in any acceptable form whatsoever unfortunately shows that all the critics of the EU, and also those who now reject the institution, are right, as we are flagrantly disregarding precisely the fundamental principles on which a democracy should be based.
Treaty after Treaty, we have been allowing the centre of power to remain completely unsupervised in reality and the Council - and this can be proven - to be lazy and incompetent and to operate largely in secret. I say 'lazy' because it can be proven that the majority of ministers - that is, those who take the decisions that are really important to Europe behind closed doors - are often not even present, and civil servants take decisions on extremely fundamental issues. This used to happen in Austria until 1848, after which the situation improved somewhat. This is not democracy.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to say two things on behalf of this committee. Congratulations to the rapporteur, who asked straightforward questions and received no answers. Congratulations to this committee, which adopted Mr Søndergaard's report by an overwhelming majority - 27:2. The Member States are conspicuous by their absence today even though, as I would remind you, Mr President, we placed this item on this afternoon's agenda especially to accommodate the Council's scheduling problems. The Member States are doing things here that they would not dare do at home.
Now we shall be conducting an election campaign where things are being shifted to Brussels again. The problems lie in the capital cities, not Brussels. I should have liked to see the Commission offering us somewhat greater support on this from time to time. In my view, its behaviour is sometimes rather too cowardly. When, as the rapporteur says, we have comptes hors budget - in my country we call these 'black accounts' - this calls to mind Eurostat and similar stories. This will not work for long. It was this committee's job to warn of such a development, and I am proud that it did so by such a large majority. I believe - and this is a positive message I shall take away with me if the House follows our lead by what I hope will be an equally large majority tomorrow - that we have ensured that control does indeed work. There is someone to take care of it. After that, we shall take a look at the consequences.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, I should like to introduce another rather different emphasis into this debate. Some speeches we have heard could give rise to the impression that there is no parliamentary scrutiny of common foreign and security policy, but this is far from the truth. Excellent cooperation has evolved between the Council and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, and we are informed of every detail - including the budgetary aspects. The Committee on Budgetary Control is not involved in this - this is an internal matter for the European Parliament - but the Chairmen of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence are regularly informed of budgetary aspects. Parliamentary scrutiny is taking place here.
Things may have gone very unsatisfactorily in this regard from the point of view of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I agree that the Council's absence from this debate is unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, nonsensical remarks such as those made by Mr Martin give the impression that there is no democratic control of any kind of the important matter of foreign and security policy in the European Union. There are more important things, for example the issue of the accounts from which Mr Solana's travel is financed. There is the issue of the operations in Chad, Congo, Georgia and many other countries. Dialogue and effective democratic control are a reality here.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 149, which was Rule 145 in the previous version. I was mentioned by name; I was accused of making nonsensical remarks. I firmly reject this accusation. The data can all be documented. It is true that, in many cases, civil servants take the decisions in the important committees of foreign ministers and others - the specialist Councils - because, for whatever reason, ministers have not made the trip. Sometimes it can be proven that they prefer to attend party conferences.
Mr President, I should like to pick up briefly on what Mr von Wogau said. Mr von Wogau, you may have a body that holds very interesting discussions on future projects. However, discharge is not the responsibility of three Chairmen or a diverse body, but instead of the Committee on Budgetary Control and then of plenary. If you can tell us what is happening with the Council's off-budget accounts, then please go ahead. I am convinced that you do not know, and we do not know either. Yet, by granting discharge, we take full responsibility for what the Council has or has not done.
The Council must offer us a solution to this; it has time to come up with one, and we would urge it to do so. I am a little ashamed on its behalf on account of the members of the public up there, as this is the negative side, the arrogant side of Europe. We no longer live in a monarchy, and it is time that, in this regard, the Council joined us on the path of democracy - of greater democracy - which, incidentally, it always helps push through in the Treaties, too.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as symbolic as it may be in this institutional triangle, we are all the same witnessing with astonishment today an essential act of the European Parliament - the discharge - taking place, and one key participant is missing. Indeed, I am thinking, ladies and gentlemen, of the visitors who are witnessing this scene in which some speakers are saying that extra-budgetary accounts exist, which cannot be made public - meaning that they cannot be dealt with transparently - and in which the Council is not here to testify where necessary to difficulties or to other circumstances.
rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, first of all I would like to express my satisfaction with the unanimity of the views which we have heard here today and I hope that they will have some impact on the Council. I fully endorse what the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Bösch, said to Mr von Wogau, and I would also like to put one more thing to Mr von Wogau: Why should Parliament grant discharge, when it is being denied information?
Certainly, if this were a matter for some other body, there would be no reason for us to get involved. May I point out, however, that if we do grant discharge, we will be taking on a degree of responsibility. Granting discharge means taking on a degree of responsibility and we can only shoulder that responsibility if we are given information. It may well be that this information has been made available to some other quarters in Parliament, but why should the Committee on Budgetary Control be denied access to it, when it is supposed to be dealing with this matter?
I also think that Mr Staes made a valid point in proposing that we ask the Bureau to lodge a protest with the Council, especially because there are unsigned documents being circulated which appear to originate with the Council, with partial answers from the Council to the questions we have raised. It is totally unacceptable, of course, to have a situation where unsigned documents which claim to answer our questions are being handed out to the press, when the Council is not attending this debate to present its views. Therefore, I think it would certainly be a good thing if we went along with the proposal for the Bureau to register a note of protest with the Council.
Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the two principles that have guided my work since the start of this process have been ensuring that all modes of transport are on a more equal footing with regard to passengers' rights - which is an objective that the Commission and the European Parliament have set themselves - and ensuring that these rights are clearly enshrined in this text. In the latter instance, special attention was paid to people with restricted mobility, since the maritime transport sector was in fact lagging behind somewhat where these people were concerned.
The content of the version adopted in committee on 31 March would appear to be acceptable to everyone. This is, firstly, because the rights of persons with restricted mobility are being increased. Should this text be adopted, it will no longer be possible to refuse persons transport on the grounds of their disability, except, of course, for reasons linked to boarding conditions, to respect for their dignity and to the technical elements of the vessel. Furthermore, assistance must also be provided for persons with restricted mobility, and this, from the time of booking; today, thanks to the Internet, there is a need for return journeys and official information. This has therefore been dealt with in the text.
The definition of force majeure - which represents grounds for a possible refusal of transport - is put forward, and, on this issue, we have worked on a consensus amendment, which we have produced jointly. I would however remind you that in the aviation sector, today, the Court of Justice has often been obliged to take decisions due to cases of force majeure not being defined well enough. Thus in this text we have tried to address problems linked to maritime transport. I am referring to tides, winds and storms, which are also par for the course with maritime transport and which had to be considered.
On behalf of my group I have tabled just three additional amendments for tomorrow's vote. Let me describe them briefly for you: Amendment 73 is a simple linguistic clarification, and Amendment 82 sets a ceiling for the strict liability set out in Article 6(3) of the proposed regulation. As regards the scope of the text of the amendment passed by the transport committee, all the political groups have agreed on the inclusion of regional transport. As for urban and suburban transport, two key texts will be put to the vote tomorrow.
These are important legal regulations which are of great interest both to consumers and to the transport sector. The EU recently adopted regulations of the same type for air and rail transport. The recently submitted Commission proposals will complete this legal framework. In practical terms this means greater protection for all travellers, especially disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, regardless of the means of transport. Moreover, it will create equal conditions for all areas of transport. The Czech Presidency of course welcomes these proposals and attaches great importance to them. I believe we all share the objective adopted by the EU in recent years of reinforcing passenger rights.
The second is that you have aimed for a precise harmonisation of the draft regulations with versions of existing regulations applying to the rights of persons travelling by different forms of transport, and you have proceeded very carefully in adapting the proposals to the specific requirements of bus and coach transport or transport by sea and inland waterway, without abandoning the aim of reinforcing passenger rights. We fully agree over the need to adapt legal regulations to the specific characteristics of the various forms of transport. As we all know, it is not possible to apply exactly the same approach to different kinds of transport. Rail and air transport have their own characteristics and the same applies to bus and coach transport and transport by sea and inland waterway. There are huge differences even within these individual branches. Large and small companies operate and journeys can take several days or just a few minutes. It is therefore necessary to find a solution acceptable to everyone that will ensure the protection of consumers without imposing an unnecessary administrative burden on the sector, and particularly the smaller firms on the market. This issue is of particular importance in the current economic situation of course.
We therefore appreciate your work on these issues. It provides an excellent starting point. At the same time it is also for the most part in line with our opinion on the proposals. I firmly believe that we will be able to cooperate constructively on legal arrangements which will protect the interests of all concerned and will at the same time take account of the EU objective of improving the process of lawmaking. In conclusion, I would like particularly to thank the rapporteurs Mr Albertini and Mr Teychenné for their excellent work and carefully drafted report.
So, I think that today we are discussing topics that affect the lives of all citizens, which is why I am persuaded that as far as the bus and coach proposal is concerned, support should be given - and the meeting of the Committee on Transport and Tourism of 30 March showed encouraging signs of this - to the Commission's approach for the widest possible scope, covering all regular passenger transport services whether international, national, regional, urban or suburban. This responds to the need to simplify legislation, but also to guarantee equal rights for all passengers without exceptions of principle.
The liability of bus or coach companies vis-à-vis passengers in the event of death or injury represents another essential element of the proposal. There are too many disparities on this within the Community, which creates serious uncertainties for passengers. I would like to look at couple of points on this subject in more detail: firstly, this area does not deal with the issue of insurance, but is concerned exclusively with carriers' liability towards passengers. Secondly, the bus or coach company is not deemed solely liable for compensation for damages and its right to claim compensation from third parties is not questioned. Thirdly, this area concerns neither imports nor the procedures set out in the 2005 directive on insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles; and fourthly, the Commission has not in fact developed a new liability model. What is being proposed today is a liability scheme that is inspired by other modes of transport, while taking account of the particular features of this sector.
As regards maritime transport, I believe that a single legislative instrument is needed, even if there are differences of opinion on this in both Parliament and the Council. Allow me to point out a key issue regarding scope: compared with road, rail and air transport, there are far fewer passengers who travel by sea or inland waterways. Among these, those who use inland waterways represent just a small minority. In my opinion, it seems neither logical nor realistic to have separate regulations for sea passengers and those who use inland waterways, even less so when one considers that they often use the same kind of vessel. I think that a single legislative instrument must be the answer.
In this context, the Commission is of course prepared to make any clarifications and improvements to the text that may be required to take account of the particular characteristics of each type of service and thereby provide the industry with the tools to apply the regulation with the necessary flexibility. Allow me to emphasise again the need to provide the resources to implement the future regulation effectively. To this end, it is important that the national authorities responsible for its application submit periodic reports on their activities. Each Member State will be able to organise its own national system as it sees fit, for example by choosing whether to have one or more competent authorities.
There are just a few points on which I should like to expand. I think that 25% compensation for maritime passengers for two to three hours' delay is perfectly appropriate, as is 50% for delays of over three hours - but I would say to Mr Teychenné that 100% compensation for delays in excess of this is simply excessive. If we bear in mind that shipping services are provided not only by colossal undertakings but also, particularly in the case of ferry operators, by small and medium-sized enterprises, we must take a reasonable approach to compensation.
The Commissioner in his remarks said we need the same rights for all passengers with no exceptions - and then he spoke about the exceptions, for example for regional transport. I do not think we should exempt regional transport, and I have done some research. In some of our Member States a regional coach journey can take up to six hours, which is longer than an international coach journey from, say, London to Brussels or Paris. So I think it should be included. I think it is right that, where local transport - as Mr Jarzembowski has referred to - is not included, there are public service contracts which mean that the companies will reach the same sort of standards.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) I should like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of our group. I think we have added another few elements to the rights of passengers. We have worked hard to get things on the right track for aviation and rail travel. In fact, I take the view that we gathered a great deal of experience when we compiled these reports, and I am pleased that Mr Albertini has aligned the various elements, so that there is hardly any need, if any, to distinguish between the different modes of transport, but only as and when necessary.
As for Mr Albertini's report, an important question - one which Mr Evans and Mr Jarzembowski have also made reference to - is what is the scope of the regulation now? We, as a group, have withdrawn our support for the amendment which we originally submitted together with you, not because we feel it is an inferior amendment, but because the Socialists have found a better way of wording it, as Mr Evans described. We are, in any event, dropping regional transport from the regulation, but we are leaving open the option to include urban and suburban transport in it, should Member States so wish. I happen to believe that this approach better corresponds to what we are aiming for, and we will therefore support this proposal put forward by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
In the field of bus, coach and maritime transport, for which we are now laying down rules, we may encounter problems assigning responsibilities when it comes to maritime transport and the ports - but this must be given a practice-based solution in future. My second point is that we should include as much as possible when it comes to bus and coach transport. If we make too many exceptions, we give operators the opportunity to circumvent the rules. We cannot continue to put the people who have to contend with particular needs at a disadvantage by allowing these difficulties to continue. It is our duty to take care of and ultimately also to enforce their right to mobility.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for the work they have accomplished. The report provides a very balanced clarification of the rights of passengers and of all modes of transport, including in bus and coach transport, and clearly addresses all the relevant issues. Attention has been given to people with disabilities or reduced mobility; as Mr Albertini's report shows, we must be able to provide services that take account of the diverse requirements of such people.
In addition, all the concerns relating to this mode of transport - refunds, compensation, passenger information, strict liability and complaints - have been covered in a clear manner. Both I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have worked willingly with the rapporteur to achieve the clearest possible text, taking account of passengers' interests on the one hand, and the requirements of the companies that manage and provide these services on the other, who need sufficient time to comply with the rules. I therefore hope this text will be approved by tomorrow's vote.
(DE) Mr President, service-providing enterprises are there for the users of these services and not primarily for the service providers themselves. In this light, it is important that we lay down the appropriate rules for the users of all means of transportation and ensure that the services they are using are also of suitable quality. In this context - and here I am only taking up something that is mentioned time and again - it is very important that we look after the rights of persons with reduced mobility in particular. As I see it, one issue is now almost in perpetual motion in this connection. Let me tell you, it is not only those with a disabled persons' identity card who are incapacitated. Parents - adults with young children - certainly also need support from our rules on all our modes of transport. I hope that this also gains acceptance in one form or another.
My third and final point is that we had started to lay down rules on air passengers' rights in the interests of passengers, but were too lenient. What airlines get up to, particularly in connection with delays, announcing that the last aircraft arrived late and so the next has been delayed, is no longer acceptable. We should have resolved the matter with high compensation payments at the time, which would have achieved an effect similar to that achieved for denied boarding. Now, unfortunately, this effect is not being achieved. It is not force majeure when an aircraft is cancelled because it is half-empty. There are many tasks for the next Commission in this regard. Vice-President, if you take on this portfolio again in the next Commission, I would urge a revision of air passengers' rights. This is urgently needed.
However, we need to remember that the protection achieved by legislation is not the same as that actually enjoyed by citizens, as we have seen from its application to date in the two sectors of air and rail travel. Those of us who use these means of transport, we MEPs and I personally, who travel between three different borders, can say that it is not applied effectively. That is why the Commission rightly spoke of a first step which needs to be improved, mainly in terms of the effectiveness of the contribution of the main undertakings responsible for granting rights to passengers.
We should not condemn small undertakings when they face the problem of providing transport services; I refer here to cabotage, about which I have questioned the Commissioner on other occasions. If they do not decide to take on the cabotage line, how could they undertake such a service when they will also have to take care of passengers' rights? We therefore need to give citizens the facility to enjoy the main right of transport and then to give them the additional advantages of passenger compensation in the event of delay. So first the service and then compensation for delayed services.
(DA) Mr President, if we were to examine how the population views disability, we would find that, nowadays, when it comes to holidays, disabled people prefer to go to the US. Legislation and rules are much better there and they receive much better treatment in the US. Europe is not the preferred destination amongst our own people. Our own European compatriots do not want to holiday in Europe if they are disabled. They travel to the US. I think that is a clear sign of how immensely important the dossier we are working on here is, as regards a number of points, including tourism.
Mr President, Mr Svoboda, honourable Members, I believe that citizens following this debate on passenger rights and the new laws we hope to adopt in order to strengthen a system of freedom that characterises the European Union, will realise today that the Commission, Council and Parliament, and their respective staff, are not ivory towers where issues are discussed that have nothing to do with citizens, or else invade their lives in a negative way, but institutions with citizens' interests at heart, seeking to defend their rights and, I would emphasise, to protect their fundamental freedoms: no one is free unless they can move around freely from one part of the Union to another.
I would argue that this time, however, the general interest should prevail, that is to say the protection of citizens' freedom and the freedom of passengers in all existing transport systems, because it would be inconsistent to protect only those who travel by air or by train, and not those who travel by boat, bus or coach. Of course, let me repeat, differences of opinion may exist, and there are differences between the Commission and the Council and also among certain Members of this House as regards the regulation of transport by water; there are those who would prefer separate legislation for river and sea transport.
The Commission has confirmed its position, I think the right thing to do is to have a single form of regulation, but it does not really matter, what matters today is that we grasp the good news of the strong political will of Parliament, Commission and Council to guarantee passengers rights, especially the rights of passengers with reduced mobility. It is not simply, I was pleased to hear, a question of rights and above all freedoms for people with disabilities; giving millions of passengers with reduced mobility the opportunity to move around freely within the European Union also means allowing these people to contribute towards the EU's growth, since the movement of these millions of people brings welfare, develops transport companies and creates opportunities for tourism in all sorts of places.
Then there is an idea of perfectibility, or room for improvement, which has been alluded to by Members who, although sympathetic to the circumstances to which we have adapted, want the area of rights to be further expanded, to cover urban transport and to protect passengers with reduced mobility. So then, we are on a journey towards perfection; human affairs are yet to be perfected, and this regulation, which is 'reasonable' and, I think, well drafted, is also 'perfectible'.
In connection with the report on the rights of passengers when travelling I would like to point out something which does not apply to protecting the interests of consumers but rather to a violation of the principle of free movement of persons within the Schengen zone. It specifically concerns the movement of persons across the Czech-German border. Czech citizens are complaining ever more frequently - both to me personally and to regional and local authority representatives in the Czech-German border region - about harassment by the German police when they cross the Czech-German border, either in groups or in private vehicles. Citizens complain that they are being stopped for no reason by plainclothes policemen, checked and even interrogated about the aim and purpose of their trip to Germany. The behaviour of the German police is nothing less than harassment and it is in direct conflict with the principle of free movement of persons within the EU. I would like to emphasise that such cases are becoming more frequent and I call urgently on the EU authorities to put right this unacceptable state of affairs.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you. It is a somewhat unprecedented exercise in style that the European Parliament is carrying out on this report since, I would remind you, the issue of urban mobility was first raised by the transport commissioner, Jacques Barrot, over two years ago now, and it resulted in a Green Paper by the European Commission, which submitted its conclusions to us in spring 2007. The latter were addressed in a report - an own-initiative report - by our Parliament, drafted by my fellow Member, Mr Rack, who is here in the Chamber.
I must say in passing that, over the last few months, we have obtained the overwhelming support of all the organisations that take an interest in these matters. They include, in particular - I should like to make the point here for the benefit of the few remaining Members who have some reservations about this initiative - local authorities and all the organisations that represent local authorities, including in countries which, today, plead subsidiarity as a way of explaining to us that this action plan is out of the question.
Would we, as Europeans, give up on having the slightest idea or the slightest initiative in areas in which transport will present the most complicated and, no doubt, the most fundamental problems in the years to come? We think not, and that is why the European Parliament did not want us to keep quiet, did not want us to keep quiet on urban mobility. Rather, in some ways it wanted us to use this initiative to call on the Commission to take up this matter again as a priority for the next mandate.
That is why I should like firstly to thank Mr Savary. I repeat: thanks to him, we have made progress in the field of urban transport, and today's report, which will be voted on tomorrow, is a very important message; it is a message that I must listen to, and I hope to be able to give Mr Savary positive feedback on his commitment during the next term of office. I am grateful to him once again for the work he has done on the issue of urban transport.
As you are well aware, I am committed to the issue of urban mobility and to the swift adoption of a well-drafted action plan. I would like to reiterate that this is planned for in the Commission's programme of work for 2009 and I hope that it will be adopted as soon as possible. Mr Savary put it very well in his speech; there is some resistance within the European institutions as some people feel that an action plan of this kind would violate the principle of subsidiarity. I do not think there is any question of this, especially if we look at the Latin root of the word subsidiarity, which is subsidium, meaning 'help': it is our job as European institutions to help local institutions work more successfully. Helping someone does not mean replacing them, it means contributing towards a better solution to problems!
Today's vote will not be the end of our dialogue on this. As the Commission's work proceeds, I will make sure I stay in contact with Mr Savary and the other Members who have followed the transport sector closely, so that the plan the Commission adopts will be in keeping with what Parliament is adopting and will represent genuine quality. Finally - let me say again - our plan will not show that the Commission is replacing local bodies, but simply that the Commission wants to help local bodies to improve their work by sharing information and best practices that will enable citizens to live better and move around more easily within cities, outside cities and while crossing cities. I therefore thank the European Parliament for the work it has done and the vote it is to hold on this plan.
While respecting the principle of subsidiarity, of course, we expect you to present us with a guide. The latter will be useful. Its aim will not be to constrain local authorities, but rather to help them. We expect you to present us with indicators - again, not as a constraint, but as a support. Above all we also expect you to present us with the travel plan-related elements. In certain countries, these exist; in certain countries, they are even mandatory, they are absolutely vital.
Swifter action is required, Commissioner, for these action plans on urban mobility are a crucial element of the recovery plan, but they are also crucial in terms of the climate-change challenge since, as you pointed out, 40% of pollution is found in cities. I should not like to ignore the safety aspect, either, since two out of three road accidents occur in cities. When we know that one death costs nearly EUR 1 million, and one case of serious injuries more than EUR 1 million, you see the economic cost and the human cost that this challenge of urban mobility represents each year.
At the same time, however, I should like to make it abundantly clear that what many fear or believe they should fear will not happen. No one wants to take the right to configure traffic conditions away from the municipalities or the local or regional authorities. We merely want to help from the European side to ensure that action is taken on the basis of reasonable common rules where a municipality, a town or a regional entity considers it reasonable. The principle of subsidiarity is not in danger. What we want to do here will help to protect that principle.
The report contains a number of interesting proposals. An obvious one is the collection of information, of comparable data which will help map out problems. Others include the exchange and promotion of sound ideas, directing technological innovation, ensuring that systems are interoperable, encouraging towns to compile mobility plans and taking steps to arrive at sustainable mobility. These and other examples clearly concern matters that should be organised at European level in a bid to make our towns more liveable, more easily accessible and more sustainable. I therefore count on the Commission to take this over and address this in the interests of our residents.
We are delighted that the majority is in favour of only giving EU money to towns with over 100 000 inhabitants which can also submit a sustainable mobility plan. We are sorry that our proposal to introduce a general speed limit of 30 km/h, with the facility for towns to set higher speeds on certain roads in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, did not achieve a majority. This would not only be good for the climate; it would also reduce the number of road traffic accidents. Every year 40 000 people die on the roads of Europe; that is 40 000 too many.
Since the report is excellent and is right to give due consideration to the principle of subsidiarity, I should like, briefly, to address the link between urban mobility and inland shipping. Sustainable economic development in Europe, not least in the area of transport and in the urban areas, will largely depend on the use of inland shipping. Many European cities have inland waterways and, consequently, the innate capacity to meet growing demand in transport in a sustainable manner. After all, the increase in inland shipping requires no major infrastructural investments, does not contribute to congestion in European cities and does not increase the environmental and climate problems in European cities, provided that it uses clean engines and clean fuel. If the inland shipping capacity is already present in European cities, this should be utilised and promoted.
What is important to me, first and foremost, is that our report, Parliament's report should highlight strict compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Legislative measures at European level are inadmissible for urban traffic. Supportive measures are what we are here for. Brainstorming and encouraging the exchange of best practices make sense. We do not all need to reinvent the bicycle. Our towns need bespoke solutions, but they can only be worked out by local players, because only they know what is needed.
The challenge is for innovative actions to be adopted and legislative measures to be taken that will significantly improve the quality of life of citizens in cities. It is a fact that the daily lives of European citizens have become considerably more difficult as a result of stress from travelling, congestion, pollution, noise and the deterioration in the environment. A balance therefore needs to be struck between the ambition, on the one hand, to develop the common transport policy as a right to mobility and as an important part of economic growth and, on the other hand, an integrated approach that will improve traffic congestion and make a drastic contribution towards combating climate change.
I am aware of the sense of urgency felt by the majority of Members, but - as Mr El Khadraoui pointed out - there are legal objections in several European institutions, not just the Commission, and we must overcome these by convincing those who have doubts that an action plan of this kind, I repeat, will not breach the principle of subsidiarity. I will say it again, having studied Latin for many years, I am very familiar with the meaning of the word, which is positive; it means 'to help'.
After the debate we have had today and having read Mr Savary's text, we want to carry on down this route. For my part, I have no hesitations, but in order to reach our goal we need to persuade many people, and I think the right way to do this is with strong political, technical but also legal arguments. The text drawn up by Parliament will certainly be of great assistance in seeking to overcome the objections that I am sure can be overcome in the next few months. The Commission will thus give citizens an action plan, which will definitely take full account of the work you have done in recent weeks and months.
European citizens' quality of life depends directly on making urban transport more convenient and greener. For this reason, making transport accessible and supporting interoperability are vital actions. At the same time, the investments channelled into these types of public works are an effective way of investing funds provided in the European and national economic recovery plans. This approach is about focusing on citizens in their dual role of workers - through the creation of new jobs - and beneficiaries of transport services and of the improvement in the quality of the environment.
The existing technologies and means for transporting passengers and goods in an urban environment have reached their absolute limit. Indeed, smaller European cities are already being choked by vehicle traffic. In order for us to improve our citizens' quality of life, we must speed up the development and implementation of scientific research and innovation in the area of urban mobility. It is definitely the case that channelling resources into simply expanding the existing infrastructure will not help us overcome the growing crisis. We must find new, 'intelligent' solutions for tackling not only current, but also future problems with urban transport. This is why I welcome the suggestion for developing a new generation CIVITAS programme as I think that the focus must be on developing the next generation of information technology for managing traffic flows.
All these difficulties are being further exacerbated in the present recession by plummeting prices in road freight transport. Marco Polo II has also felt the impact of all these problems. That is why we transport politicians are urgently interested in a solution, because our stated target, namely that Marco Polo should help to displace 60% of the increase in road freight traffic, is now a long way away. We therefore need to switch direction before the end of this parliamentary term and we have therefore found a most reasonable compromise.
What is to happen? Firstly, the Commission instructed an agency to take over the administration of the programme and to simplify the administration procedure even before this regulation was proposed. That makes sense. We have found and jointly negotiated a whole series of points in the compromise in order to make the programme more attractive. Firstly, the threshold for Motorways of the Sea has been reduced from 250 to 200 million tonne-kilometres a year; secondly, the threshold for traffic displacement projects has been reduced from 80 to 60 million tonne-kilometres, as has the threshold for inland waterway projects, where Parliament pushed through a reduction from 17 to 13 million tonne-kilometres. We have also increased the permissible funding level for additional infrastructures from 10% to 20%. That makes sense. Finally, we also successfully argued that economic crises such as we are experiencing now can also be cited as grounds for extending the term of contracts.
So we have made the programme considerably more attractive. This compromise which we reached was also made possible by a high degree of consensus between all parliamentarians, who put aside justifiable considerations and fundamental debate at this point, in order to quickly get the programme started again. That is why, before the Commission tables a Marco Polo III proposal, we really need a general debate so that we can reintroduce all these points which are necessary to our future orientation. Moreover, we naturally want to know how the adjustment we have made now will work out. This is the subject of the vote and I hope I shall have your support tomorrow.
Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for the work he has done. Since 2003, the Marco Polo programme has aimed to create a more sustainable transport system in Europe by shifting a substantial part of the annual increase in road freight transport to other, more environmentally friendly modes of transport such as inland waterways, rail transport and short sea shipping. The first Marco Polo programme, which aimed to shift 48 billon tonne-kilometres from the roads in four years, ended in 2006, although the external assessment has shown that only 64% of this figure was achieved.
I therefore believe - and it looks as though Parliament shares my view - that the time has come to amend the regulation, to change the rules on access to this project, or programme, which must be granting funds that are not always used. We are definitely moving in the right direction, because we are trying to help small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from a Community project. SMEs have, up to now, faced quite a lot of difficulty in accessing the European funds granted through the Marco Polo programme.
The message we are sending out today is not only directed at those who use Marco Polo. It is, I believe, a call for many European regulations to be amended, since the same is true of other sectors and of national regulations involving European funds; they are not always written in such a way as to make them easy to access. This is a very real problem in all Member States, and I would emphasise again that it concerns not only our regulations, but also national regulations that involve European funds.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DA) Madam President, when the Committee on Budgets decided to issue a statement on the Marco Polo programme, its precise reason for doing so was that it had found it difficult to ensure that the funding was being used for its designated purpose. We, therefore, obviously welcome the fact that action is now being taken. The Commission deserves praise for this. We are trying to simplify the administration and tighten up the rules, in order to make it easier for funding to be used for its designated purpose. In response, we on the Committee on Budgets have also agreed that, if we fail to improve the implementation of the programme, if we fail to ensure that funding is being used for its designated purpose, we will need to rethink whether so much money should be allocated to Marco Polo and whether some of the funding should be rechannelled into other programmes, where it can be better used. Of course, we need to carry out a mid-term review of the budget after the 2010 elections and one of the things we will obviously need to get to grips with then is an assessment of which programmes are working and which are not. Where we see that there is more acute need, we will obviously divert money away from projects where it cannot be used and redirect it, so that it is not merely wasted as a grant.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, plenary will vote tomorrow on the Marco Polo II programme to improve the environmental performance of freight transport. Marco Polo II offers improved planning security, because it is timetabled to run until 31 December 2013. It has a budget of EUR 450 million. The eligibility thresholds for the proposed projects are to be lowered in comparison with Marco Polo I and are equal to utilisation by small and medium-sized enterprises. I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for that. In light of the current financial situation of many small and medium-sized enterprises, this is a very citizen-friendly policy to which I can give my unconditional support.
The European Commission's proposals to simplify the programme should, therefore, be supported, and in particular: participation in the programme of small and single-person businesses without having to form consortia; a clear reduction in the tonne-kilometre threshold required for eligibility for the programme; raising funding intensity by increasing financial aid, which has grown from EUR 1 to EUR 2 per 500 tonne-kilometres of shifted goods transport; and simplifying the procedures for granting financial aid. I would like to express the hope that all these measures will help to ensure that the best use is made of the financial means available in the programme.
There is a problem, though. This reduction is not enough. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mrs Wortmann-Kool and I successfully remedied this mistake. I regret, though, that Mr Stockmann deems our amendment - number 24 - undesirable. I know him, after all, as a staunch supporter of inland shipping and I had hoped that such amendments would have been agreeable to him. After all, the threshold proposed by the Commission is still far too high for the small entrepreneur, which the canal shipping trader is, almost by definition. I cannot understand why the other institutions should wish to pick holes in Amendment 24.
I would like to say that in recent years my staff - whom I thank again for their work - have already begun to reflect on the Marco Polo programme beyond 2013, and that this assessment will focus, among other things, on the points set out in the compromise agreement. In particular, I would like to emphasise the need to differentiate between transport modes in the conditions for funding, on the basis of safety, environmental performance and energy efficiency, the need to set up demand-driven assistance at the application stage, taking account of the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, the recognition of economic recession as an exceptional reason for extending the duration of projects, and product-specific lowering of eligibility thresholds.
Going back to our reflections on the Marco Polo programme beyond 2013: as I was saying, the themes will also include the possibility of indicating the targets for minimum funding thresholds for proposed projects in terms of energy efficiency and environmental benefits in addition to tonne-kilometres shifted. In addition, the possibility of ensuring consistency between the Marco Polo Programme, the Logistics Action Plan and the TEN-T programme by taking the appropriate measures in order to coordinate the allocation of Community funds, in particular for Motorways of the Sea; and the need to take into account the specific characteristics of the inland waterway sector and its small and medium-sized enterprises, for example by way of a dedicated programme for the inland waterway sector.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I agree with you. We can send out a positive message tomorrow, namely that we are able to make citizen-friendly and sensible amendments to our legislation when it is necessary to do so. We should not only send out this message; we should also start up an information campaign in the countries of Europe, so that we can capitalise on the attractiveness of this programme, because we really have made all the necessary adjustments. Now there are real deals to be had at bargain prices. If we cannot manage to shift anything now, then we really do need to question the entire programme.
I hope, Mrs Jensen, that we shall not have to put the money into other programmes, because this is an important concern. We must and will displace traffic wherever possible, but it is difficult. Mr Blokland, you have already had an answer. We re-negotiated inland waterway transport and forced an additional compromise on the Council, as it were. Our concern was to finish at first reading. That is why we could not take too radical an approach and had to negotiate with one eye on compromise and consensus. As a result, we achieved a great deal.
I look forward to the fundamental debate which we shall have shortly on the third programme, on the basis of a communication which the Commission has promised, so that we can discuss all the fundamental questions, everything that we have listed in a joint motion for a compromise, such as whether we should split up the programme for individual modes of transport and so on. Then it will become exciting again. Now it just has to work, so that it does not grind to a halt and projects already under way possibly fall by the way-side in this crisis. That really would be a pity, hence this compromise. My thanks once again to everyone for their input.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Commission proposal is to create European corridors for rail freight transport and also to establish rules for managing and administering these corridors. The Commission is trying to increase the competitiveness of rail freight transport through the proposal and I would like to take the opportunity to applaud this. The Committee for Transport and Tourism has discussed the Commission proposal, in respect of which a total of 250 draft amendments were submitted. In negotiations over the draft amendments a compromise was achieved which won support across the political spectrum. The compromise arises mainly from an attempt to optimise rail transport as a whole while at the same time retaining enough flexibility to resolve crisis situations. The text proposed by the Commission has also been refined and simplified, and emphasis has been given to creating space for the legitimate interests of individual countries, both in terms of establishing corridors and managing and administering them. The position of the rail companies in the administrative authority has been strengthened compared to what it was in the Commission proposal. A stronger role is also given to organisations involved in the European rail freight corridors. The comments relating to cooperation with third countries affected by the corridor have been accepted. A number of changes involve a better balance of interests between passenger and rail freight transport. A request for transparent decision-making has also been accepted in relation to assigning track categories and setting out rules of precedence for high-speed freight trains. In conclusion, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the workers of the European Parliament for their cooperation and the honourable Members of this House for their patience.
Madam President, honourable Members, Mr Duchoň, for my part I would like to thank Parliament for having agreed to look at this proposal so promptly; I believe it is extremely important for the development of rail freight transport. My particular thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Duchoň, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their willingness and the quality of the work carried out, which has helped to strengthen a legislative proposal aimed primarily at better integrated rail transport at European level through closer cooperation between infrastructure managers.
In addition to the main objectives of the proposal, though, I would like to mention four essential principles on which the text we are discussing is based. The first principle is the identification of corridors and thus of the network. This identification is based on economic rather than political factors. The second principle is strengthened cooperation between infrastructure managers. The third principle, which I would like to look at in more detail, concerns better guarantees in terms of the quality and reliability of services provided by the infrastructure, thanks to provisions designed to strike a better balance between passenger and freight traffic in infrastructure management.
In cases of operational disruptions in particular, we cannot have some distant office making decisions; competence must remain with the individual infrastructure operators and railway companies, so that normal train traffic can be resumed as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Even within the special regulation for the European freight rail network, the Member States must continue to be responsible for creating and changing freight corridors. Any sort of transfer of competence to the European Commission would not be helpful, on that we should agree. Finally, railway companies, shippers and forwarding agents should be consulted on corridor regulations, because they have practical knowledge and experience about how to make the most effective use of the rail network for competitive freight traffic.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Cross-border goods trains trundle through the European Union at an average speed of 18 kilometres per hour. In 2007, only 60% of all goods trains arrived at their destinations at the scheduled time. Why? Because the international transport of goods by train is still being organised in a wholly ineffective manner. In that way, the transport of goods by train can clearly never compete with road haulage. At this rate, we will not achieve the European environmental objectives, and our intention to emit 20% less CO2 by 2020 will come to nothing.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also want more freight on the railways, but not at the expense of passenger traffic. Passenger mobility is a public service in Europe. The Commission is ignoring the realities of Europe's rail networks, in which goods and passengers are carried on the same rails. There should be no dogmatic priority for either one sort of train or the other.
The debate has demonstrated relatively broad agreement across the political spectrum. For that I would like to thank both the shadow rapporteurs and everyone taking part in the discussion. I think the greatest fears arise from the possibility of collisions between freight trains and passenger trains. The submitted text takes account of this danger and leaves sufficient flexibility for handling crisis situations in the hands of the operators. As far as properly and smoothly functioning rail operations are concerned, there should be no such conflicts of course and it makes no sense to debate the priorities of one or the sort of rail transport. It is therefore only a matter of potential conflict during crisis situations, but as I have already indicated the key issue here is to leave enough power in the hands of rail operators and this document does exactly that.
I would ask that we concentrate on what we are due to vote on, which is to say Mr Casaca's report. Irrespective of whether this is deemed to be a private or a public fund, this report is about a very specific matter, namely Parliament establishing, firstly, that it has no legal claim to have its deficits subsidised and, secondly, that, furthermore, no such subsidising of deficits will take place. There is no money for the fund. That is the crucial point, and I would ask that we vote on it.
In principle, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety asked for an opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs, but the opinion was requested solely on the basis of the original proposal from the Commission. In the Bowis report, it is now clear that a change has been made whereby patients' rights are also mentioned in this report, and therefore the legal base has also changed. These amendments have, however, been declared inadmissible and therefore the fundamental change which Parliament wishes to make - in other words from an exclusive market orientation to including patients' rights - is in trouble. I would like to ask that the report be referred back to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Amendment 100 refers to the responsibility of Member States to exchange information about disciplinary and criminal findings against health professionals. This is absolutely appropriate, but it has been brought to my attention at the last minute that this could be construed as saying that if such health professionals were involved in any traffic offences, for example, then Member States would have a responsibility to share information about that. That clearly is not the intention of the amendment and so, for clarification, the wording proposed would now read: 'Member States shall, immediately and proactively, exchange information about disciplinary and criminal findings against health professionals where they impact upon their registration or their right to provide services'. So this is purely a matter for clarification.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I accept your ruling - it is your right to make such a ruling - but because earlier Ms Liotard said that we would need to have a dual base, because, otherwise, if it was only the internal market, that meant we would only be voting on economic issues, without trying to open up the debate again. I would just correct her to say the single legal base that we currently have is not just economic: it is about freedom of choice for patients' rights. Therefore, our group will be voting against a dual legal base, both for these original amendments, and indeed the recital. I would encourage other colleagues to put the patients first.
rapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, it is almost 15 years since the end of the war in Bosnia and almost exactly ten years since NATO's bombing campaign forced Serbian forces to leave Kosovo. In December, it will also be 17 years since I, myself, came to Sweden as a refugee from the war that set my former homeland alight and made bitter enemies of the Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs who had previously lived together as neighbours. The fact that neither Bosnia, Kosovo nor any of the other countries in the Western Balkans has relapsed into war since then is entirely down to the EU and NATO. However, even though the weapons have fallen silent, the legacy of the war lives on in politics and society in the region. The only chance for people in these countries to overcome their past is for them to continue along the path towards EU membership. Only the carrot and the stick that constitute the key dynamics of the accession process can get the governments of these countries to focus on carrying out the work and the reforms which, once and for all, can consolidate stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans.
The first is that there is a fundamental difference between the countries currently involved in the enlargement process and those which acceded in 2004 or 2007. The countries of the Western Balkans were ravaged by full-scale war and ethnic cleansing little more than a decade ago. Fortunately, the same cannot be said of Hungary, Estonia or Romania. However, this means that the EU cannot simply copy the handbook from previous enlargements and apply it to the Balkans. An example of this that I mention in my report relates to the prohibition on the extradition of suspected criminals facing indictment in other countries. Such prohibitions are currently in force in all of the Balkan countries, but the EU is currently making no demands for their abolition. The justification for this is that no similar demands were made of Slovakia or Poland, for example. It should be obvious why this analogy is not valid. I would think that there are extremely few suspected war criminals hiding from justice in Slovakia, but I can tell you that there are considerably more in Serbia and Bosnia. Justice is the basis on which reconciliation can be built. Impunity for war criminals is completely unacceptable, and I therefore wish to urge the Commission and the Member States to once again raise the issue of the possibility of getting the countries in the region to take steps towards a coordinated abolition of these prohibitions.
The second matter I would like to highlight is that the accession process is, as I have mentioned, very stringent and demanding - and so it should be. If we do not make stringent demands and insist on them being met in full we will not actually achieve any real results. When the requirements are already so stringent and difficult to meet, the last thing we should do is to throw more spanners in the works for those countries who wish to become members, spanners that have nothing to do with the ability of those countries to meet the EU's membership criteria.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the European Parliament for organising this important discussion this afternoon. I read with great interest the report of Anna Ibrisagic on future stability and prosperity in the Balkans and the draft resolution on Bosnia Herzegovina drawn up by Doris Pack. The Council agrees with much that is said in the report and we share many of the opinions and concerns expressed in connection with the situation in Bosnia Herzegovina.
I would like to focus my introductory comments directly on Bosnia Herzegovina because stability there is vital for the future of the Western Balkans as a unit, and also because the current situation continues to cause concern. The Council has been active both in formulating and implementing a strategy supporting the security and integrity of Bosnia Herzegovina, and in backing the reforms needed for ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future. Therefore I cannot accept the assertion that the Council is not paying enough attention to Bosnia Herzegovina.
We all know that we are still living with the consequences of the tragic events of the 1990s, as Mrs Ibrisagic has also mentioned here. Bosnia Herzegovina, which for decades was a symbol of peaceful coexistence of nations, cultures and religions became an area of devastating conflict. Since then the EU's policy has been to work on stability and reconciliation based on the promise of a European future for the entire Balkan region. Despite this we are still frequently confronted with fiercely nationalistic rhetoric aimed at reinforcing national differences in Bosnia Herzegovina and at preventing national reconciliation. The passage of time has not yet resolved these conflicts and neither has it healed wounds between the three nations that make up Bosnia Herzegovina.
It is nevertheless surprising that the nationalist rhetoric and opinions go together with the common interest of all Balkan communities and their political representatives in a European future for Bosnia Herzegovina. The inhabitants of Bosnia Herzegovina are simply struggling for a safer life and prosperity. They want to move ahead and they rely on their country becoming integrated into European and other structures as a guarantee of future stability. Although local political leaders talk a lot about Bosnia Herzegovina's future in the EU, it is difficult to see any real commitment to this agenda from their actions. The conflict between interest in a more European orientation and nationalism creates a real risk that while the rest of the Western Balkan region moves forward, Bosnia Herzegovina will be left behind, bound up in its internal conflicts.
Concerns over such future developments in Bosnia Herzegovina have meant that the country remains at the top of our action agenda and the focus of constant attention. Bosnia Herzegovina has been and continues to be the subject of intense negotiations at all levels of the Council. The Commission and secretariat of the Council are developing their contacts with partners in the country in an effort to take the political process forwards and to help Bosnia Herzegovina keep in step with the rest of the region. Member States are supplementing the European agenda through their own efforts at a bilateral level. We also very much appreciate the attention given to Bosnia Herzegovina by this Parliament. I would like to express my gratitude to the many MEPs here today who have supported all of the actions promoting stability and political maturity in Bosnia Herzegovina.
Bosnia Herzegovina must carry out significant changes to its internal structures and decision-making processes. We are disappointed about the absence of progress within the framework of the Bosnian Council of Ministers and Parliamentary Assembly. They are lagging far behind what is needed. National bodies urgently need to be strengthened and improved on an operational level in a way that will start to bring real results, including substantial progress in EU-related programmes. This is essential, because the EU can deal with Bosnia Herzegovina only as a whole, and not with its individual parts. The priorities of the European partnership are also clear. The Union is always prepared to help but it cannot and it will not take on tasks which belong to the politicians in Bosnia Herzegovina.
Despite the continuing nationalist political agendas, we realise that compromise and agreement are possible in Bosnia Herzegovina. We saw this earlier in the adoption of the two police laws, for example, which prepared the ground for signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, or the solution of the Brcko issue, which marked the accomplishment of one of the essential objectives defined by the Council for Peace Implementation. However, even in these cases, progress was always achieved and agreements were signed at the last minute and under considerable pressure from the international community.
A much more mature approach is required. It is of the utmost importance that local political leaders behave responsibly, show some initiative and are aware who Bosnia Herzegovina really belongs to and who is really responsible for its future. The inhabitants of Bosnia Herzegovina deserve a better result from the votes they cast in the ballot box. This is an aspect which you, as politicians, can help to bolster more than anyone else. Such a development would lead to a significant advance as far as the presence of the international community in Bosnia Herzegovina is concerned. Change is essential. So many years have passed since the signing of the peace agreement and Bosnia Herzegovina must now stand on its own two feet, abandon its "protectorate” way of thinking and become a credible and fully-fledged state. In order to achieve this aim, the Council for Peace Implementation, acting on behalf of the international community, drew up the list of five objectives and two conditions which Bosnia Herzegovina must fulfil before any change can be achieved. This constitutes a real test of maturity and it is fully supported by the EU.
We have already welcomed many times last November's Prud declaration by the three political leaders in which they made a commitment to work together in supporting the development of Bosnia Herzegovina. We support the agreements which have been achieved and we urge the political representatives to continue their efforts with a view to the next meeting of the Council for Peace Implementation's management committee, which will take place at the end of June. I firmly believe that unresolved issues relating to government assets can be resolved and should not become an obstacle to a solution. However, initiatives at a political level require broader support. For this reason I would like to urge society as a whole in Bosnia Herzegovina to become part of the reform effort. The role of the media in particular should be more constructive.
The mission of the EU is clear. It is supremely important for the political leadership in Bosnia Herzegovina to cooperate even more closely in order to overcome historical differences and to lead their country towards closer integration with Europe. The EU will always be willing to help in this effort which is essential not only for Bosnia Herzegovina itself but also for the broader stability and security of the region. I know that in this process we can count on the support of members of this Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, I remain grateful to you for this support.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am glad that the Western Balkans are back on the European Parliament's agenda this week. In recent years a steady stabilisation in the region has taken place, not least thanks to the region's European perspective, with the ultimate goal being EU membership once the conditions have been met by every country. Croatia's negotiations are quite far advanced. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a candidate looking forward to opening its negotiations, and we have a network of Stabilisation and Association Agreements in place. Stability in Kosovo was maintained throughout last year's important developments.
In this context, I very much welcome Mrs Ibrisagic's report. It rightly emphasises the fundamental importance of offering the Western Balkans a European future. It is the main driving force of much-needed reform and greater stability in the Western Balkans. Ten years after the horrific events in Kosovo, we should remind ourselves of the power of the European perspective. It still helps today to consolidate stability and peace in a region that is, effectively, our own front yard - not back yard, but front yard.
The accession negotiations with Croatia have, until recently, been going well. This is why the Commission proposed, in November 2008, an indicative road map to reach the final stage of accession negotiations by the end of 2009, provided Croatia fulfils the conditions. There is still plenty of work to do, and many reforms need to be stepped up by Croatia. Unfortunately, the negotiations are currently blocked because of the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia. This is a bilateral issue which has de facto become a European problem.
Since January, working closely with the Czech Presidency and the trio of the Czech, French and Swedish Governments, I have taken the initiative to help facilitate a solution. The aim is to find a solution to the border issue and allow for the continuation of Croatia's EU accession negotiations. This is still work in progress and we have needed a great deal of patience and determination to keep up the momentum and progress. We had a full day of talks yesterday with the foreign ministers of Slovenia and Croatia, as well as of the trio countries. I want to believe that we are close to finding a way forward and overcoming these obstacles so that we can continue Croatia's EU accession negotiations shortly.
Concerning the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I welcome the overall satisfactory conduct of the presidential and municipal elections. Over the past months we have insisted on the importance of these elections for the country's European future. The country has responded positively to our message, thus confirming its willingness to move forward in its accession process. However, the key priorities for reform should not be forgotten. It is indeed now time to step up efforts in order to meet the benchmarks which have been set for the opening of accession negotiations.
I would like to thank Doris Pack for her motion and welcome the opportunity to discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina with you today, at a very crucial moment. Last year, Bosnia and Herzegovina made progress on the path of European integration, especially through the signature of the SAA and the entry into force of the interim agreement. There have been positive developments in recent months as well, including the Prud Agreement, progress on the Brcko issue and steps towards a census in 2011. Also, the implementation of the SAA interim agreement is broadly on track.
Finally, looking at 2009 overall and the Western Balkans region as a whole, there has been quite good progress in the area of visa liberalisation, which proves to my mind that, when the incentives are right, the countries respond with effective reforms. This is most likely the single EU policy area that matters most to the ordinary people - the ordinary citizens - of the Western Balkans. We hope to table a proposal for visa-free travel by the end of the Czech Presidency for those countries that are most advanced in this field and have fulfilled the established conditions. This could enable decisions by the Council to achieve visa-free travel for the most advanced countries by the end of 2009.
Given that it is possible to observe a monopolistic market power in essential economic sectors in the region, such a situation erects a twofold obstacle, certainly when this goes hand in hand with party political ties. Internal development is stagnating and European businesses are staying away. The prime example of this is the unimpeded rise of Delta Holding in Serbia, with its influential director Miroslav Mišković as the 'octopus' at its head. The Commissioner met him back in October.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the autumn of last year, we gave up all hope that, following the so-called Prud Agreement between the representatives of the three main parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina on joint political steps in numerous political fields, something really would change in political life. Where are we today? For the most part they were empty promises which, on closer inspection, evaporated into thin air. The ethnic division in Bosnia and Herzegovina has deepened. The lack of trust has increased. People are being manipulated through irresponsible policies based on purely ethnic criteria, instead of the real problems being tackled. Everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina needs the chance of a good education, everyone needs a good judicial system, they need jobs; in short they need the hope of a better future.
However, it is difficult to come out of cover, because the party political network extends over the entire country. The few jobs which may be on offer depend on the goodwill of the parties. We wish the High Representative the best of luck in untying the Gordian knot of the politicians' passivity, laissez-faire and laissez-aller, so that peace and stability can finally return and the people's future becomes rosier than it is at present.
I should like to pick up on what Commissioner Rehn said, because it seems to me that it was the most important message in today's debate; namely, that the process of the integration, the rapprochement of the countries of southeast Europe should not be interrupted, not only in the interests of these countries, but also in our own interest. The Commissioner said that you need to be realistic in the Commission. Perhaps in this Parliament we could be a bit more idealistic but, in the final analysis, we too must be realistic. It is a long and difficult road and the objective will not be achieved overnight. That is why the comments which I hear from a few people, along the lines of 'let Croatia join and that will put an end to it for some time', are the wrong signal. Nothing that Mrs Pack called for and rightly demanded will come about if people there have the feeling that, come what may, they are not welcome in this European Union and their accession will be dragged out anyway.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the main thrust of Mrs Ibrisagic's resolution on the Western Balkans is perfectly clear. She has emphasised the correlation between reforms in the region and the countries' likelihood of accession to the EU. This is the dynamic that we applied so marvellously during the last major enlargement of the EU. The resolution identifies a number of practical areas where these countries could improve their performance, as well as the many notorious problems besetting the region. However, for me it is equally important today to point out to these countries, their politicians and peoples that they must keep their side of the bargain. They, too, must take an active part in the process, because it is not just the European Union that is expected to come up with the goods. In addition, the integration process must also be promoted from within these countries. What this means is that they must combat corruption and crime and create a strong civil society and knowledge-based economies and societies. That is the process we would like to see taking place, so that we may look forward to all countries of the Western Balkans becoming fully-fledged members of the European Union one day, which will be the foundation of ensuring peace, security and cooperation - in that part of Europe, too.
Above all, we are unable to accept the ironic tone of a report whose very title, 'Consolidating stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans', is stupefyingly hypocritical. A stupefying report, in fact, which, with the obvious intention of preparing for the accession of new countries, notably Bosnia, so-called Macedonia, Albania, and - why not? - Kosovo too, speaks as if the current situation in the Balkans were stable, completely ignoring the terrible game being played by two major powers, the United States and Germany, which have painstakingly participated in the political break-up of the whole region.
The decision by many EU countries and the US to recognise Kosovo as an independent country has also created new dividing lines in a region that has suffered so grievously from division in the past. We know already that Kosovo is unable to join the EU, as some Member States will not recognise it, and there is a similar story about joining the UN. In contrast, neighbouring Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia are progressing slowly towards eventual EU membership. Thus Kosovo could end up as an isolated enclave, deprived of EU membership but bankrolled by EU taxpayers for decades to come.
- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, even in a time of economic crisis the EU must not forget the commitment it made to the countries of the Western Balkans in terms of future EU expansion. Therefore I welcome this debate and the clear confirmation of the commitment to future expansion. European integration is in the vital interests of all the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country we are paying special attention to in today's debate. In this context it is necessary to state that the promise of EU membership was offered to Bosnia and Herzegovina as one country and not to its constituent parts. For this reason - and we have repeated this many times here - the effective reforms required for entry into the EU must be implemented. The constitutional reform of Bosnia and Herzegovina should result in the existence of a functioning centralised state with the appropriate legislative, budgetary, executive and judicial powers enabling it to maintain a functioning single market, to pursue political, economic and social cohesion and to defend the country's interests abroad including, one day, as a member of the EU. I would like to end by calling on the countries of Western Balkans, the Council and the Commission to increase their efforts to abolish the visa regime. Visa-free contacts and the free movement of persons would be a great help to the Western Balkan countries on their path to EU membership.
Mr Swoboda has just said that a problem with developments there is that one has the feeling that, no matter what changes are made there, the country will still not accede to the Union. Yet when I speak with people there, I get exactly the opposite impression, namely that they are saying, 'Even if we change nothing, we will still join because they want to have us there so badly'. Whichever of the two misconceptions we are talking about, we must get rid of them both.
I am not talking about enlargement, but what is needed, above all, is to encourage the integration of the countries and the regions in the Balkans. Yes, we need to show that we are demanding, that we demand democracy and justice, but to use these demands continuously to reject integration is, in my view, a basic political error. I cite as proof these issues, among others, of bilateral conflicts. We have to agree - and this appears in the report - a process for settling bilateral problems, but without for all that blocking the accession process. That is one way to build and to rebuild our European Union, enlarged to include all the Balkan countries.
Since Yugoslavia fell apart in 1992, attempts have been made to turn Bosnia and Herzegovina into a unitary state, but to no avail. I expect this will not be possible in the near or distant future. Agreement among the three peoples and their political leaders on effective governance is possible only when nobody feels threatened any more by the others or by the outside world. Only when the EU's High Representative and foreign soldiers have withdrawn from this country will a compromise be possible. Until then, the stagnation will persist.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a very useful debate. I am also delighted that the EU Member States have given their general backing to the idea of visa liberalisation with the West Balkan countries. I would like to express my wholehearted agreement here with the statement of Mr Rouček, who made a very powerful appeal in this regard, as the strengthening of personal contacts between citizens of West Balkan countries and citizens of the EU is surely a positive step which will help to overcome the sense of isolation that some of these states feel and which will help create a Europe without barriers. I also firmly believe that the economic crisis we find ourselves in today must not become an excuse for slowing down the expansion process, as speakers such as Mr Rouček have also said here. On the contrary, it is particularly important for the stability of the region that the process does not lose momentum.
I am also delighted that progress has been achieved in negotiations over Montenegro's application to join the EU, which the Council has just handed over to the Commission for drafting. The presidency considers this step to be a very important signal to the whole region. We also consider the unblocking of the accession talks with Croatia to be important. We consider it unhelpful for the expansion agenda to be burdened with bilateral issues. Progress over European integration with Serbia continues to be a challenge and it is conditional upon full cooperation with the relevant international tribunal, including the arrest and handover of the remaining accused. The presidency is working hard for the provisional agreement on trade and commercial matters to be applied from the EU side as well for the ratification process of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed last year to begin. The importance of the stabilisation and association process for reform in Serbia and for supporting the predominantly pro-European government is beyond dispute. The presidential and local elections in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have met most of the international standards and generally recognised conditions for the free and democratic conduct of elections. However, it is clear that without a solution to the bilateral dispute over the country's name its progress down the path to candidate status will remain minimal.
As far as Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned, the country must move forward. Dependency on the international community is not helpful but rather erodes the principle of responsibility and takes responsibility away from local politicians, as Mr Swoboda so rightly pointed out here. I would like to take this opportunity to call on the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to join forces actively with the aim of leading their country towards a better future. It is counterproductive to go back to politics based on ethnic principles, as Doris Pack so aptly put it. The planned transfer from an Office of the High Representative to a strengthened Office of the Special Representative of the EU does not mean that either the international community or the EU is quitting Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the contrary, the EU is there to help and it is fully aware of the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not just another candidate but is actually a very specific case with very sensitive issues and problems. As part of its strategy the EU is planning to create an office and a policy for peace and it will be ready to take over all coordination activities from the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, we will do that only when Bosnia and Herzegovina itself demonstrates that it is ready for such a significant qualitative change. The first major step towards Europe was taken with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, but that was just the beginning. We are prepared to continue providing assistance in this unavoidably long process.
2009 is an important year and it could be decisive for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Firstly, the transfer from an Office of the High Representative to an Office of the Special Representative of the EU is within reach. It represents a significant step away from dependency for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Secondly, the period after the next general elections in 2010 should be fully utilised for the promotion of the essential reform agenda, including constitutional reform, as Mrs Pack correctly pointed out. Thirdly, the entire region is moving forward. Bosnia and Herzegovina simply cannot be allowed to remain behind. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end with something we all want. We want Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve progress. We appreciate the support we receive towards reaching this objective from the honourable Members of the European Parliament.
I agree with Mr Maaten that all the countries of the Western Balkans share the view that one day they will be able to join the European Union if they meet the conditions of Union membership, based as they are on the Copenhagen criteria. This is also true of Bosnia and Herzegovina; in the case of the conditions that apply to them, there will be no shortcuts or bargain discounts, and if anyone assumes there will, he or she is wrong. It is very important that this proper way of thinking gains a firm foothold in Bosnia and Herzegovina's own political debate, so that its citizens can draw their own conclusions about what sort of policy they have the right to expect from democratically elected politicians.
I see Bosnia and Herzegovina's future as follows, and my view is based on collaboration with Javier Solana, with whom we have produced several communications on the country's future and the role of the European Union there. Firstly, our aim is to move away from the Dayton era to the Brussels era, that is, from the era of the international community's High Representative to the European Union's reinforced presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That also probably means the 'two hat' system in the case of the EU Special Representative and Head of the European Commission Representation, so that we can exploit the political and economic resources the European Union has in the best possible way.
This issue also has political importance, because it is too easy to blame the international community for Bosnia and Herzegovina's problems, when people do not want to look in the mirror. It is too easy to blame the High Representative when you should be negotiating and trying to reach agreement with your fellow countrymen and women. I hope that in this respect Bosnia and Herzegovina's political culture will improve and mature and that the country's media will also take responsibility for ensuring that negative, nationalistic language does not get any more space than is the case at the present time in the country.
This is the message that I would like my report to send out to the 500 million Europeans who are soon to choose a new Parliament, to the governments of the Member States, to the Commission and to the people and politicians in the Western Balkans. It is a message that is particularly important to send out at a time when the economic crisis is in danger of leading to ever more people and politicians in Europe wanting to close the door behind themselves and not allow any more people to live, work and trade where they want to on our continent. I also hope, therefore, that this is a message that my fellow Members of this Parliament will take out with them in the forthcoming election campaign. If Europe has become colder and more inward-looking, then it is a priority task for us in this House to work to make it welcoming and open once again.
Both my fellow Members and I wanted to ensure that this resolution confirms this fact in principle and in the details of the EU's interaction with the countries in the area. We are concerned, as I highlighted in my amendments, about a number of issues: the visa regime, the process for informing citizens about the EU, economic cooperation with the states in the Western Balkans, minorities' rights, study programmes in the EU for young people from the region, as well as strengthening interparliamentary dialogue even before these states join the EU.
in writing. - (HU) The European Union's enlargement policy is the best instrument available for preserving stability and the prevailing peace in the Western Balkans region. We hope that we will be able to welcome Croatia in 2011, during the Hungarian Presidency, but this depends on Croatia finally agreeing with Slovenia on initiating bilateral talks with international mediation, regarding the division of the Bay of Piran. The purpose of the talks on the Bay of Piran is to resolve the ongoing border dispute between the two countries, without which Croatia will certainly not be able to become a member of the Community. A further condition is that Croatia also cooperates fully with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague in searching for and extraditing war criminals.
On 11 June 2007, at the first informal meeting of ministers on questions of disability, the Council adopted a clear position supporting the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. At this meeting the Council approved the UN Convention as a basic step concerning support, protection and adequate implementation of human rights and basic freedoms for all persons with disabilities. At the same time the ministers made a commitment to a further development of relevant policies with the aim of securing a full implementation of the Convention. They called on the Commission to ensure that the new priorities of the European Action Plan in the area of disability contribute to the effective implementation of the UN Convention.
In its resolution concerning activities linked to the European Year of Equal Opportunities in 2007, adopted in December 2007, the Council called on the Commission and the Member States to continue with the process of signing, concluding and ratifying the UN Convention in accordance with their respective powers. On 10 March 2008 the Council adopted a resolution on the position of disabled persons in the European Union. In the resolution the Council called on the Member States and the Commission to ensure, in accordance with their respective powers, that persons with disabilities were able to access all of their human rights. This includes the ratification, the conclusion and the implementation of the UN Convention including common European solutions within the framework of a managed and coordinated approach to the implementation of this convention. The Council subsequently received from the Commission a draft Council decision on the conclusion of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Physical Disabilities by the European Community. The review of this proposal began at the end of last year and the Council is still dealing with it.
Ladies and gentlemen, as your report emphasised, a number of important questions arise from the report in connection with authority and these questions require further discussion in the Council. However, the Presidency has made a commitment to try and complete the negotiations as soon as possible, in order for the Convention to be concluded soon by the Community. I would like to thank Parliament for the interest it has shown in this topic. The Presidency will keep you informed about progress in the talks that are underway in the Council.
rapporteur. - (BG) Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today when we are discussing the European Parliament's reports on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, its Optional Protocol and the statement on these two documents from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to remind you that disabled people account for more than 10% of the population of the European Union and the world. According to data from the World Health Organization, this percentage is still growing due to the increase in the overall size of the Earth's population, the advances made in medicine and the global ageing trend.
Fellow Members, the European Parliament has always consistently supported every effort made by the Community in drafting, implementing and enforcing legislation relating to equal opportunities and non-discrimination against people with disabilities. When the issue of disabled people is raised, our political differences disappear when it comes to the ultimate aim, namely, for us to ensure a higher quality of life and work. There are, of course, different views about the way in which we can achieve our objective, but with its almost unanimous decision - only one vote was not a 'yes' - the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proved that differences must be overcome about the way to achieve sensible, long-term and sustainable solutions.
Fellow Members, I believe that our decisions, the decisions of the European Parliament, are of huge significance to people with disabilities in the European Union. At this point, I would like draw your attention to the fact that the competencies which stem from the implementation of the UN Convention and the Optional Protocol are divided between the Community and its Member States. The implementation of the Optional Protocol is important from the point of view of offering the opportunity to individuals or a group of people to inform the UN Committee for people with disabilities about any infringement of their rights arising from the Convention. It is important to emphasise that this option will be available after national legal protection instruments have been exhausted.
The European Parliament made very important points clear to me in the resolution on the situation of women with disabilities adopted in 2007. The specific situation of women and girls must also be given full consideration when implementing the UN Convention. Regrettably, so far only 4 EU Member States have ratified the Convention and the Protocol. We need gender mainstreaming in EU policies on people with disabilities, especially for access to work and integration in the workplace. Education, anti-discrimination and the right to work must be secured.
I would like to stress that the European Union promotes the active inclusion of people with disabilities and their full participation in society. This is the approach at the heart of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This is why we are calling for these international documents to be ratified urgently by European Union Member States, as well as for the active involvement of disabled people and organisations representing them in the process of monitoring and implementing these documents. We also urge Member States and the Community's executive to ensure free access and the distribution...
We have since achieved a legally binding convention which, I believe, is historic. That is a milestone in itself, but what I said in 2003 I will say again. If the EU is to have any credibility in this debate, it must lead by example. International human rights treaties are of no use whatsoever if countries do not sign, ratify and implement. Yes, all Member States have signed, but they have not all signed the protocol. Most of them have not ratified, and they certainly have not implemented - something we have called for in numerous parliamentary reports.
At the same time, we call on all the Member States to ratify the Optional Protocol, so that the UN Convention acquires an international complaints committee. I can only tell you how important this is with reference to my country. Until now, disabled persons have been refused equal access to education. Only 15% of disabled children are integrated into the school system. Claims to access for disabled persons are circumvented in my country with translation tricks. That is why we must protest against the fact that this sort of thing is still happening and safeguard full social participation for disabled persons in all the EU Member States in future.
Mr President, I am very proud to have been at the launch at Sadler's Wells in 2001 of the campaign for the Convention. I am very proud that Members across this Parliament have played a leading role in supporting the creation of the Convention. I am very proud to have been with the Human Rights Subcommittee in Geneva at the Human Rights Commission and Council to lobby for its agreement. I am very proud that the European Commission and the European Communities have signed up to a human rights instrument for the first time. I am very proud that it is the swiftest-agreed convention in the history of the United Nations, but most of all I am very proud that disabled people and disabled people's organisations have played a full part in its consideration and its agreement.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we agree that although over the past years and decades the EU has made enormous progress in combating discrimination against persons with disabilities, the situation is still far from satisfactory. Today and every day, this month, this week, this very day thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of EU citizens with disabilities are suffering discrimination. They are discriminated against on the labour market, in the service sector, in transport. They are discriminated against through poorer access to public services and they are very often discriminated against in respect of access even to some basic public services such as education at every level. I am quite sure we agree that the main problem we are confronting in this area is the social exclusion of our fellow citizens with disabilities. To tackle this we need a whole series of legislative acts which will prevent discrimination, but at the same time we also need a functioning system of social services as a key instrument not only for limiting social exclusion but also for bringing about social inclusion. The greatest problem facing citizens with disabilities is of course their much higher levels of unemployment.
In the economic problems currently affecting the EU we all know that it is our fellow citizens with disabilities who are paying the highest price for the worsening situation on the labour market. The availability of employment opportunities is worse for them than in times of prosperity. They very often pay the price of having poorer qualification and education structures than the rest of the population, and this naturally has very negative consequences for their chances of integrating into the labour market. They very often face much worse access to education, to normal schools and educational institutions, as Mrs Schroedter correctly pointed out. I would also like to say that we are fully aware of multiple discrimination, which confronts many citizens with disabilities, as Mrs Breyer pointed out. And here I would like to say that the convention we are debating includes a specific article applying to women, so multiple discrimination has not been forgotten here. At this moment we must of course applaud the 7 states that have ratified the convention. They have set an example for other states which have yet to complete the procedure. The clear call from Mrs Lynne for the ratification process to be speeded up is important, but on the other hand we must respect the fact that ratification has rules, that these rules must be respected, that these rules are often very different in the various Member States and they have to be respected.
I would also like to applaud the statements we have heard today, for example from Mrs Plumb, who pointed out the major role of the voluntary sector partners in developing and implementing policies relating to our fellow citizens with disabilities which attempt to limit discrimination against them, to limit their social exclusion and to integrate them socially. I would only like to say that the Council has devoted great attention to this matter and that the Presidency is placing great emphasis on the participation of the voluntary sector partners. In the spirit of our motto, 'Europe without barriers', we have also invited all representatives of disabled persons to events connected with this issue. Under the sponsorship of the Presidency a series of events arranged by disability organisations have taken place.
I would like to mention the meeting of the Council of the European Disability Forum which took place in Prague between 28 February and 1 March 2009. Also this week, an international conference entitled 'Europe without Barriers' took place. It was set up by the Czech National Council for Persons with Disabilities. The conference was held directly under the auspices of the Presidency and constituted one of the Presidential events. As a participant I can confirm that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was one of the main items on the conference agenda. The Presidency is determined to develop significant activities in this area, including regular contacts with voluntary sector representatives at a pan-European level.
I would like to end by pointing out the convergence of the European action plan on disability and the UN Convention, as well as the results achieved in implementing the action plan, which places special emphasis on dignity, fundamental rights, protection from discrimination, justice and social cohesion. It is now generally acknowledged that taking notice of the issue of disability is the key to resolving it. To this end the action plan on disability has urged and supported access to social services and it has increased access to goods and services. I firmly believe that the EU will continue with the positive steps it wants to take towards full social inclusion and full integration of fellow citizens with disabilities.
The rights of disabled people are broken regularly. Recently in my home town of Poznań an incident occurred which is symptomatic of this. A Member of the Polish national Parliament parked his car in a place reserved for the disabled. Paradoxically, this MP has a friend who is disabled. Why do I mention this? It is because no laws, conventions or documents will improve the situation of disabled people if public officials openly and with impunity break rules created specially to help the disabled to live and function. Conventions are of course very important, but equally important is genuine, dependable and full implementation. Disabled people are not happy with rights which they only have on paper. People with disabilities are counting on real changes which will give them equal opportunities. Thank you very much.
Finally, and this is my last point, the members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection have tried to introduce more transparency in relation to the certification conditions for construction products, more transparency in relation to the companies' role in the certification process, and more transparency, too, in relation to the clarification of the conditions of access to the CE label, clearly distinguishing the access routes for products covered by a harmonised standard from the route reserved for products that are not and that are often referred to as innovative products.
In accordance with the principles of the Small Business Act, which was, I would point out, given an extraordinarily warm welcome by this House not long ago, the Commission proposal puts forward simplified procedures for micro-businesses when it comes to products that do not give rise to any serious safety concerns. I do not want to see this approach changed - it is one of the key points of the proposal. This is because, in practice, it is the case for a number of families of construction products - such as windows, internal doors and floorings - that the existence of very small manufacturers is extremely important for the functioning of the market and is in the interests of consumers. The potential of these small manufacturers must be exploited efficiently for the benefit of the European construction industry.
I do not share the opinion that it is necessary to prescribe the declaration of hazardous substances going beyond the rules that we have already put in place under the REACH regulation. I assure you in all earnest that the rules laid down under the REACH regulations cover everything - there is nothing more that we would need to do for the construction sector - all the concerns that I have heard are comprehensively covered by the REACH regulation. I really do wonder what point there would be in having comprehensive, integrated legislation on chemicals if we were then to go and introduce new and deviating regulations for individual products. There is no way that the Commission would support such an idea.
As construction is one of the sectors where the mutual recognition principle is most often breached, I welcome the proposed regulation on the marketing of construction products. It is a comprehensive piece of legislation which aims to update a 20 year old directive on construction products and several regulations. This regulation makes changes to the declaration of conformity requirement, harmonising the legal terminology and defining the exceptions for small and medium-sized enterprises. According to my information, producers of construction materials are very interested in the CE mark. Besides this, it should greatly simplify administration for exporters and importers and it has value from a marketing perspective.
Producers of lime, cement and bricks, for example, are already enjoying the benefits of the CE mark. In the construction sector the CE mark does not indicate safety and the national marks do not have additional value for users. Instead they represent a barrier to the internal market. National marks do not indicate that additional properties of a product have been tested, nor do they say anything about the quality of a construction product. Despite this, producers often have to pay for tests and for the right to label their products with national marks.
The harmonised standards are a more effective and appropriate instrument for producers on the construction products market and I am therefore proud of having drafted, here in the European Parliament, the framework for financing the European standards. I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mrs Neris, Mrs Fourtou and Mrs Rühle and their team for their excellent cooperation, as well as my colleagues Den Dover, Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab and Tereza Pinto de Rezende for a great piece of work. I would also like to express my thanks to colleagues from the Commission and the Czech Presidency for their accommodating and constructive approach. I wish this legislation much success.
We did, after all, agree the Goods Package a year ago, and we had to resolve the difficult issue of CE-marking at that time. Commissioner Verheugen, the decision by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to drag the compromise agreed then into this directive also has to do with the fact that the study that you commissioned was possibly not effectively represented in all parts of this House. You have a clear opportunity here, Commissioner, to press the Socialist Group more strongly not to ignore the results of the study. Perhaps there may also be some more recognition of this by tomorrow's vote, particularly since the CE marking in this directive - in contrast to in the Goods Package - does not relate to consumer-relevant information but exclusively to product characteristics that really serve a different purpose in any case.
There are a couple of points that we must deal with again when it comes to second reading. The first is the question of the regulations governing product claims. There must be more on this area, I would think, so that users genuinely obtain an effective insight. We must also prevent duplicate regulation. Annex 6, in my view, goes too far. The Low Voltage Directive and the Machinery Directive already cover many issues in this regard. There needs to be a careful reconsideration of whether there should be lex specialis regulations in this case. For the rest, Mrs Neris has produced a fundamentally sound basis for the vote at first reading.
I will make just one comment: I have indeed taken into account all that has been said because I think that this work should continue. For us, it is important for this sector to be a little more structured within the Community, but, above all, for the standard, which we would like to be a little more exhaustive as regards the CE label, to be much more consistent. In this respect, our wish is above all for further European integration for a better Europe, and, indeed, further integration for these sensitive sectors, because we know that they are at the heart of our economies and are also levers for economic recovery. There is also a need to address all the points that we have mentioned.
In a world of increasing international exchange of data, the identification of someone as a person of security or policing interest, if not corrected, could have not only inconvenient or expensive but indeed appalling consequences. One need only remember that Canadian torture flight victim, Maher Arrar - on whose horrendous experience the film 'Rendition' was based - was picked up due to profiling based on people his brother happened to know; having done nothing himself to merit suspicion, he nonetheless spent seven months in a Syrian torture dungeon.
I would also like to mention the activities of the Fundamental Rights Agency in this field. The Agency is about to present a good practices handbook for combating and preventing ethnic profiling. The Commission supports the inclusion in the 2010 work programme of the agency of joint training with FRONTEX, where the said handbook could be used. The Commission also supports the inclusion in the 2010 work programme of the agency of a project on implementing Article 6 of the Schengen Border Code that aims at collecting data.
As regards the need for a legal framework to define profiling, the Commission believes that the relevant EU legislation on border management and data protection is adequate to protect fundamental rights. Indeed, it requires that any processing activity has to be grounded on a specific, recognised legal basis and respect particularly the principles of necessity, proportionality, purpose limitation and accuracy. It is subject to supervision by independent public authorities. Currently the framework also contains strict rules relating to the processing of sensitive personal data or automated decisions. All these principles also apply to profiling as one of the ways of performing processing of personal data.
I think the European Court has been very clear on this, saying that this should be banned. We can see that it is neither efficient nor legal. The Carter Center in the US has showed it was not efficient. The German surveillance scheme on 18-40-year-old Muslim men in Germany was not efficient. It does not work, and I very much hope that we can take away the last exemptions allowing airports and harbours and so on to use these inefficient methods that make people feel bad.
Sometimes 'profiling' can be necessary, but such cases must be clearly delineated and protected against abuse. The possibilities for storing, exchanging and interpreting information have, in recent years, increased faster than the necessary limits which democracies set for themselves in this regard. The US security services have not gained better or more reliable information as a result of data mining and investigation based on profiling, but instead primarily a heavier workload. A security agent compared it aptly with filling a water glass with a fire hose, in other words, particularly inefficient.
Naturally, profiles based on ethnic origin have been used for years, even if we generally call it by another name. Even I, all of 1.60 m tall, and thus hardly the most threatening physique, have been regularly taken aside at customs. A minor personal irritation, but many people who scrupulously abide by the law experience this inconvenience not regularly, but systematically. Such people get the message from our society that they are always suspect, less worthy and unwelcome. We are not going to catch true criminals, who come from every population group, by this method.
rapporteur. - (NL) We have before us the final agreement which we have negotiated with the Council and the Commission, a final agreement after a first reading in which we in Parliament took a very strong position and introduced a number of elements that, with a large majority, in fact gave us a very strong starting position vis-à-vis the Council. I must say that the Council's common position a few months after our first reading was rather disappointing. There was not, in fact, much willingness to follow our approach, and therefore the negotiations with the Council were far from easy.
We did move a step forward, though, and there was a very constructive atmosphere. The parliamentary delegation, too, was a strong group. There was unity in diversity. I think that we can bring the result to a vote tomorrow with a degree of pride. In any case, we are making a contribution and ensuring that there is a basis, in addition to the two laws that have already been adopted on pesticides, that is, the directive on sustainable use and the regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market, a set of instruments to be used in sound regulation regarding the provision of data via statistics. This is therefore, to my mind, the basis for the parliamentary legislative work we have carried out.
We have also been able to include a very clear reference to the general legislative framework on statistics, to the way in which statistics should be used, the way in which they are handled and, above all, the way in which the data will have to be handled in future, from the perspective of confidentiality, among others. We have attained our goal in that Member States must provide considerable information on pesticides and in a form that is mutually comparable. Personally, I would have liked to go even further, but what has been achieved is a first step.
Another achievement is undoubtedly the fact that, because we took as our basic definition the word 'pesticides' and the definition of pesticides used in the directive on sustainable use, we have also, in a second instance, included the concept of 'biocidal products'. That was an important request by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. This is an achievement. It appears in the regulation, and in the current political agreement, although the latter does state that we undertake to expand the regulation on statistics and pesticides as it now stands with the concept of 'biocidal products' at the time when the legislation exists and also - and that was an urgent demand on the part of the Council - after an impact study on the matter.
We have obtained greater transparency. We have succeeded in requiring that the data must be published on the Internet. We have, as noted - it is always a question of negotiation, for that is democracy - also failed to achieve a certain number of things. I have already mentioned them, including the fact that there is a weaker formulation regarding the non-agricultural use of pesticides: on that point, the draft regulation does not entirely live up to what was achieved at first reading. It is a question of give and take, however.
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my third report on the application of Community law and I must say that - with all due respect for the considerable amount of work that we have done, together with the Commission - I do not think that we can declare ourselves to be particularly satisfied. I believe that there are basically three problems, which I would like to mention, and which have been drawn to your attention and, above all, to the attention of the Commission in our report.
Also, another issue that we had debated at length with the Commission was the 'pilot project': this is a project whereby, when a citizen complains to the Commission, the complaint is forwarded to the Member State so that it can give some sort of response. The assessment that some Member States have given, particularly our Commissioner, Mr Tajani, regarding the operation of this pilot project, is relatively unsatisfactory; the fact that the Commission no longer writes directly to those who have been accused of a possible infraction greatly reduces the capacity of an administration that is guilty, let us say, of this alleged breach, to be motivated to respond.
Previous Parliament resolutions have inspired a significant number of the initiatives introduced in the communication. Firstly, last January we introduced more frequent decision-making in infringement proceedings with the aim of speeding up cases; secondly, we launched the 'EU Pilot' project in 15 Member States last April to test a new method aimed at improving problem solving and the availability of information; thirdly, the main purpose of this initiative, which is close to Parliament's interests, is to better serve the interests of citizens and businesses with regard to questions and problems identified in the application of Community law, including infringements of this law; fourthly, the Commission will nonetheless continue to decide to prosecute infringements in the event of non-conformance within the framework of the 'EU Pilot' project, particularly through infringement proceedings; and fifthly, President Barroso has written to the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, with details of the pilot project's performance in December 2008. This letter also confirmed the Commission's intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the project's first year of operation, and preparatory work on this has begun.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - Madam President, I should like to congratulate Ms Frassoni on her report. I think she and I now, over a period of two or three years, have enjoyed working together on this report on behalf of Parliament. That cooperation I have enjoyed; I do not enjoy the fact that we seem to end up every year repeating much the same things and having a certain sense that we are going round and round in circles.
That is the point: if we do not get this right, we bring the whole of European law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute. It is as serious as that. All of us as Members, in these last days of this mandate, are spending our time tearing around, going from trialogue to trialogue and first-reading agreement to first-reading agreement, arguing about sets of words, the contents of sentences in legislation. That is great. But if, at the end of the day, it is not enforced in the way that our citizens expect, we might ask ourselves: what is the point?
Madam President, one of the key principles governing the operation of the European Union is that the Member States accept the obligation to transpose and implement Community law. This principle is foundational to the process of integration. There is without doubt a need for continuous, active cooperation of the Commission and Member States in order to ensure rapid and effective answers to doubts raised by citizens and to criticise and rectify breaches in application of Community law. I welcome the declaration of the Commission on closer cooperation with the European Parliament in the area of reporting and application of Community law.
A fundamental problem with the procedure for references for a preliminary ruling is the time needed to receive an answer from the Court of Justice, which unfortunately is still around 20 months. The reason for this is always the same - translation of the trial dossiers into all the languages of the EU. This takes around nine months. Of course, these translations are extremely important, because they ensure wide access to the latest and most important European rulings and they increase legal confidence in the European Union. However, success or failure in the effective introduction of EU law will ultimately be determined by whichever institutional model is considered appropriate. Having the knowledge and the means is not everything. The will to take action is also needed.
Of the new cases of infringement in 2007, 1 196 concerned a failure to notify national measures relating to the transposition of Community directives. It is unacceptable that the Commission should grant itself 12 months to deal with these simple cases, which, apart from the necessity of a quick reaction, do not require any analysis or assessment. The 'EU Pilot' project, which was launched a year ago in 15 Member States to test the new method for reaction to complaints, could be extended to the other Member States, but the lack of information on assessment of its operation does not, unfortunately, allow Parliament to comment on this issue.
I will just give one example. About 20 years ago we agreed to have the four freedoms throughout the European Union. In my constituency there are many people of Italian origin, one of whom is a teacher and, obviously, a fluent Italian speaker. He returned to his family home in Italy and was forbidden to teach in his family's native country because his training was undertaken in England. That surely must be wrong, but there is nothing that we can do about it because the Italian authorities say - for whatever reason - that this is reserved for Italian nationals.
Finally, Madam President, there is a problem which I consider to be worrying and which is relatively new, and that is the combined effect of the extreme formality, which is continuing to increase, of the replies given by the Commission, and the increasingly arbitrary nature of decisions. Recently, an infringement case was closed for reasons of political expediency - I am referring to the MoSE project. Clearly, when the concept of political expediency becomes involved in a monitoring process that ought to be, above all, a legal one, things can become complicated.
This document already has some history. As soon as the euro was introduced and the currency exchange rates were abolished in euro zone countries, it became clear that prices for cross-border payments still differed from prices for local payments. For this reason Regulation (EC) No 2560 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in euro was adopted and entered into force at the end of 2001. It set equal charges for corresponding local, national payments and cross-border payments and strengthened this principle. The aim of this was to reduce prices for consumers and ensure greater competition in the payment services market.
The document before us is an improved version of Regulation No 2560. What is new in the document? Firstly, the principle of equality of charges for cross-border and corresponding domestic payments has been extended to include direct debit. This was not previously available. Once the SEPA had been created and the Payment Services Directive had been adopted, the payment environment in Europe changed; therefore, it is important that from November 2009 it will be possible to use the popular electronic payment method, direct debit, on a cross-border basis. In order to help create that common direct debit model, the regulation states that in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the payment service providers of the payer and the payee, the level of the default interim Multilateral Interchange Fee for a direct debit will be set at EUR 0.08 for a transitional period until 2012.
E-money is no different from other forms of money in that it stores monetary value and provides a convenient means of exchange. But, unlike account-based payment instruments, such as credit and debit cards, it works as a pre-paid bearer instrument. It is used to cover payments - usually of relatively small amounts - to undertakings other than the user, thus differentiating it from single purpose pre-paid cards like telephone cards. There is no need of a bank account in order to use e-money, so it is particularly relevant to those in society who do not, or cannot, have bank accounts.
Probably this was because of the high initial capital requirement and other over-cautious restrictions. The number of e-money institutions differs remarkably from one Member State to another. For example, the Czech Republic has over 40 EMIs, or Electronic Money Institutes, while France and Germany between them have a grand total of 12. In fact, two German EMIs were even constrained to move to the UK jurisdiction because of major differences in regulation, even under this directive. In August 2007 - two years ago - outstanding electronic money was only EUR 1 billion, and that compares with EUR 600 billion of cash in circulation.
So, clearly, e-money has a long way to go to become a serious alternative to cash. However, it is growing significantly, despite the restrictions, and this new directive should enable new, innovative and secure electronic money services to operate, to provide market access possibilities for new players and to foster real and effective competition between market participants. New and smaller operators will have an opportunity to enter the market, as the amount of initial capital needed will be reduced from EUR 1 million to EUR 350 000. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would certainly have preferred less.
We have been rushed through the legislative process for a first-reading agreement in order to get this measure enacted before the European elections. I thank most warmly Ivo and Melanie from the Economic Committee staff, the Socialist and Liberal shadows, Mr Pittella and Mrs Raeva, the Commission services and the Czech Presidency, notably Tomáš Trnka and his team, for their very positive cooperation. None of us achieved all we would have wished, but I believe we will have made a significant step forward, and I would very much welcome Parliament's support for this project.
We are now only a couple of months away from the final deadline for transposition by the Member States of the directive on payment services. These two measures, alongside the noteworthy efforts of the payments industry to develop SEPA products, constitute a crucial and timely step towards the completion of the single market for payments. These measures, together with the directive, will complete the legal basis which is indispensable in providing clarity, certainty and stability to the market. The negotiations that have been conducted in recent weeks have made it possible to obtain a very rapid agreement concerning these two issues.
When we introduced the euro in a large number of European countries, it was based on the analyses carried out on the value of a monetary union. The value is that we reduce the costs involved in exchanging money as well as other transaction costs. We reduce information costs by having a common currency. The price that we pay for this is to have more unstable economies. It is more difficult for us to maintain even and high rates of employment and to maintain stable state finances. We are seeing this right now as everything is going pear-shaped in this regard in countries such as Ireland, Spain, Italy and Greece.
Take note, then, that the victims should be counterbalanced by the benefits gained in lower transaction costs as a result of a common currency, but the benefits are continually diminishing precisely because progress with regard to the payment system is so rapid. Within a short time, we will be in a position where we find that we have such an effective payment system that the costs have become negligible. Then we will have a common currency that actually only guarantees us instability in our European economy. This is something I have said before and now you can see it happening. I urge you all to reflect on this.
However, it is a positive result and I would like to thank the Council representative Mr Trinka and the Commission representatives for their cooperation, and would also like to thank staff of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who helped to prepare this document. It will answer those questions which were raised by Mr Lungren, that is, it will help to bolster the whole euro area, because the procedures for euro transactions will be strengthened. As a representative of a country, which is not in the euro zone, I am delighted that this regulation can also be applied, if non-euro zone Member States wish, to payments in national currency, which in Lithuania would be the litas.
For the time being, in our countries prices for cross-border payments and prices for domestic payments in the national currency still differ. This is partly determined by the fact that we are not euro zone Member States. I think that the first step and one of the steps towards the euro zone would be for us, non-euro zone Member States, to begin to apply this principle to national currencies. The other important thing is that the fostering of cross-border payments by this regulation opens the way to modernising the European banking sector, because banks have a transition period of three years to prepare a new business model, which would make payments more efficient.
All in all, this is a very cautious step forward. It is not perfect. Compromises seldom are. Almost certainly it will have to be revisited in three or four years' time and, by then, I hope more operators will have entered the business. Users and merchants will be clamouring for more choice. The more doubtful regulators, banks, Mrs Berès - and even the European Central Bank - will have become reconciled that this is a beneficial, user-friendly service which holds no risks to the European economy. We in Europe can at last take up all the opportunities which e-money offers.
The cooperation in drafting this report was characterised by a spirit of trust and we were able to finish the report quickly, although - and we must think of it like this - the report before us now has significantly changed the Commission's proposal, less so in the way of content, but more in terms of structure. Many of the details have been reordered. The new proposal was necessary, because a few shortcomings emerged in the application of the 2002 regulation which led to problems in practice. Although the 2002 regulation controlled animal diseases such as BSE, dioxin contamination and the spread of other animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease or swine fever, in order to make further progress in this regard it was vital to lay down requirements with regard to the questions of responsibility, traceability and the end point for slaughter by-products.
Through the new regulation we want to increase safety for citizens and not merely shift the responsibility. It is therefore important for operators handling by-products to be subject to approval. The particular operators that will require approval are clearly regulated. The fact that, in addition to a process of approval, there is also a process of registration is due to the desire to reduce bureaucracy. In future, we will certainly have to examine carefully whether the registration procedure will ensure a sufficient degree of safety. I also think that the uncertainty previously caused by the provisions on animal by-products from wild game has been eliminated. It is now clear that good hunting practice is crucial. Game gathered in the woods must not be used. I also think that we have complied with the wishes of many Members in allowing the appropriate feeding of necrophagous birds in certain regions.
The ability to establish the end point of the life-cycle of by-products is a significant step forward. This will eliminate legal uncertainty and resolve many shortcomings and difficulties. We will have to examine whether the setting of the end point by the European Commission complies with the aforementioned criterion, namely legal certainty. I realise, of course, that it can vary from product to product and for that reason flexibility is needed, but I will also say to the Commission now that transparency is also needed so that it is also clear to the user.
Then we come to the crucial point, which, for me, is always the issue of comitology. Too many rules in the new regulation are implemented using the comitology procedure. We must examine this carefully. We know, of course, that as MEPs we have the chance to play our part here, but we also know from practice that we are not at all in a position to monitor or examine all comitology procedures. For this reason, I welcome the fact that the Commission has said that it wishes to present its proposals to the Committee on the Environment prior to their adoption. That is a good approach, because there are very many forms of comitology. I believe that we are on the right path here.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today Parliament will be asked to vote on a common position based on the proposal for a new regulation on animal by-products presented by the Commission. At this time, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, which has made it possible to arrive at this common position, and for his knowledge of the rules in the veterinarian sector that has made it possible to achieve a positive and agreed outcome. My colleague, Mrs Vassiliou, apologises for not being present at this debate in person, but she has asked me to give her personal thanks to the rapporteur for all that he has done and the efforts he has made to achieve the goal.
At the Commission, we are, of course, also grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, who have seen this this work through in a constructive manner, as the rapporteur stressed in his speech, and through this collaboration it has thus also been possible to incorporate into the common position the chief concerns expressed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Like the rapporteur, I would also like to thank the French Presidency, which did a lot of work, although it was aware that it would not itself attain the final result, and the Czech Presidency, which invested great efforts to obtain a clear and consistent mandate for the negotiations with Parliament. The Commission therefore gives its definite support to the common position.
This text clarifies the relationship between health rules and environmental rules and thus contributes to the objectives of 'better regulation'. The rules on which Parliament is about to vote will permit a wider use of by-products of animal origin, which currently cannot be put to any good use, but does so while ensuring appropriate safety conditions. There will also be a reduction in administrative costs, and this will enable operators to be more competitive. All this will be of vital importance in allowing them to respond dynamically to the challenges of the future, whether these derive from imports from non-EU countries or from new technological developments in the use of by-products.
Now, as before, we need to ensure a high degree of safety. Although we essentially support the report, there are a few points which give me cause for concern. Many points in the regulation have been made less stringent and thus make trade in animal by-products somewhat easier. Let me give some examples of what I am talking about. It is permitted to use certain Category 1 material in pet food. Category 2 or 3 material may, irrespective of the risk associated with it, be disposed of more easily, under official supervision, if there are only small quantities of waste per week. The risk associated with animal by-products of any category is only partly determined by its quantity. It remains the case that it is the European Commission that will enact the implementing regulation and, like its predecessor, the draft contains a lot of authorisations for the Commission. This means that the Commission can lay down comprehensive and fundamental regulations for handling animal by-products in the comitology procedure, with the result that Parliament - as is unfortunately often the case - is excluded.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Schnellhardt for his very ambitious piece of work in the form of this very technical report. On behalf of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Westlund, I would also like to thank the other shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation, which has resulted in us being able to vote, today, on a proposal that we are all able to support. The proposal that we are to vote on now is both clearer and easier to use than the very complicated legislation that is currently in force in this area. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are particularly pleased to have succeeded in gaining a hearing for our amendment to also allow scavenging animals the opportunity to find the food they need to survive. We are also pleased that we have managed to place the focus both on health risks and on safety, while still having the necessary flexibility. Thank you for your work and we are pleased that we have a constructive proposal.
This is about small-scale operations which take the carcasses of dead animals on farms with livestock, in pigsties for example, directly to feeding sites in the country for wild animals to feed on. This is important, for example, in Spain, to maintain the wild bird of prey population. In Finland such practices saved the white-tailed eagle from extinction back in the times when its natural food supply was too contaminated owing to chemical toxins, and when white-tailed eagles would not have been able to breed just by surviving on natural food sources.
Madam President, I agree with all contributors that public health, food safety and hygiene have to be at the top of all our agendas. I would put very high on my agenda, too, making maximum use of all natural resources, including animal by-products. I should like to thank our rapporteur, Horst Schnellhardt, for his excellent work in accommodating all our concerns and also for the excellent outcome of his discussions with the European Council. Personally, I regret the removal of the reference to the Waste Incineration Directive, but I do not have time to expand on that here.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate has shown broad support for the common position on animal by-products, and this enables the Commission to proceed with the next stage. The Commission will prepare the implementing provisions for the new regulation in the light of your comments today, we will listen attentively to the experiences of operators, we will talk with our partners at international level and we will be fully transparent with Parliament during the whole of the process.
I think that one would already need to act extremely illegally in order to be able to mix in this material. We will check whether a more stringent regulation is needed here. What we wanted to achieve with this new regulation was to enable the by-products of slaughter to be used in many ways and in that regard I can also say to Mrs Doyle that your concern is unfounded. Everything is the same as before. By establishing the end point for slaughter by-products, we have also very clearly stipulated that they will then become subject to totally different provisions, in other words we have clearly indicated the transfer to the Waste Framework Directive. I believe that we are on the right path here.
I would also like to mention that we naturally also want to address the issue of the rotten meat scandals with this new regulation. We are not completely on the right path yet in this regard, but with the labelling and the guaranteed traceability, I believe that we are heading in the right direction. Of course, we now need to see what sort of labelling the Commission will propose. This will not be particularly easy, as we all know the problem of the blue Chappi dog food - no one wants that. In this respect, we definitely need our researchers to choose an approach.
As regards the issue of organic fertilisers, which was also up for debate and has not yet been properly discussed, the Commission actually intended to provide for more thorough mixing-in of the material so that the animals did not even notice it. However, that would result in a change to the quality of the fertiliser and I believe that we have formulated a good regulation in this regard and that our small-scale gardeners who like organic fertilisers so much can also be appropriately provided for.
We will be adjourning very shortly today and we will not start the voting until 12 noon. Perhaps it would be possible to plan the sitting so as to divide the time up more efficiently. That would help the Members and, in particular, the visitors, who yesterday had to wait for us for a considerable length of time. These are, of course, citizens, who also have a right to talk to their Members, and in this regard I would be very pleased if, in future, in the planning of the sitting we could schedule such procedures to everyone's satisfaction.
In the case of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, it is all the more important that legal judgments are enforced because this court is establishing a series of important precedents in international law. It is not only the first court of this kind set up in the same country as where the events being tried took place, but it is the first which has indicted and convicted, in the person of Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, an African head of state still in office at the time when the trial started.
In short, the Special Court for Sierra Leone is a fine example and a benchmark for all of us and for all courts that have dealt with war crimes. It is a fine example and a benchmark and it is a lesson being given to us by the second-poorest country on the planet: as we entered the court, we saw the slogan 'no peace without justice'. That is exactly why we have a moral obligation, not only as Europeans, but as human beings, to ensure that the legacy of this Special Court leaves its mark on history.
Mr President, in Poland we sometimes say that 'what you begin, you should also finish'. This is very relevant to today's debate, which, above all, is about financial support for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. It is true that we are in the middle of a crisis, and the Court, which is maintained from voluntary contributions made by various countries, absorbs large sums of money. We must not, however, allow this body, which is the only one of its kind, to end its work in international disgrace - and it would be a disgrace, if for financial reasons the Court ceased to function and the accused were released.
The Special Court for Sierra Leone has, in fact, played an essential part in the development of international law, by virtue of the case law that has been created on issues such as the recruitment of child soldiers and forced marriages, which were the subject of the Special Court's first judgments. To this end, the Commission has been supporting the Special Court's activities since 2003. We have given the Special Court EUR 2 700 000 through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. The aim of this funding is to support the activities of the Special Court on communicating its objectives of promoting the rule of law, international humanitarian law and human rights in Sierra Leone and the region of western Africa as a whole.
Furthermore, in 2008 the Commission adopted a project, funded by EUR 1 million, under the 10th European Development Fund, conceived together with the Special Court and the Sierra Leone Government. The project, which is to be carried out during 2009 and 2010, will integrate previous activities and sets out to ensure a lasting legacy on which to rely after the conclusion of the Special Court's activities, in particular through the capacity-building of legal professionals and the strengthening of institutional capacity within the Sierra Leone legal system as a whole.
Having been informed of the Special Court's budget problems, in 2008 the Commission provided it with emergency aid to the tune of EUR 2.5 million, funded from the Instrument for Stability and intended to cover the funding costs, and chiefly the salaries, of the Special Court's employees. On this point, the Commission was pleased to learn that the Special Court has managed to cover the budget deficit for several months. We are confident that, despite the world financial crisis, the international community will manage to find the resources necessary for the Special Court to carry out its tasks successfully and in full, and to complete the trial of Charles Taylor, former president of Liberia.
(PL) Madam President, I would like today to comment on the serious accusation which was made in this Chamber against Members of the European Parliament, and on the slander of the European Parliament uttered by Mr Martin when he said that some MEPs do not vote themselves, but send proxies, who vote using the MEPs' voting cards. This is unacceptable behaviour, because the proceedings of the European Parliament are transmitted live. The citizens of Europe are sitting in the balcony and they heard today, in an election year, something extraordinary. It is slanderous, and I would ask that at its next meeting the Bureau instruct Mr Martin to withdraw his words and to apologise to all the MEPs who sit in this Chamber.
Madam President, you did indeed deal with it very speedily, but I do think that it is not acceptable that a Member should rise in his place and make such a serious allegation against other Members of the House. I hold no support for the gentlemen of the extreme right, but the President of Parliament must uphold and protect the rights of Members. We are being accused of all sorts of outrageous things, and we are entitled to proper conduct and ethical behaviour by our colleagues here in this House, and indeed outside the House.
Madam President, following that exchange and your very helpful reply, I was unable to catch your colleague's eye yesterday to report that the same Member - I decline to use the world 'honourable' - had published an article in the Austrian press naming a member of Parliament's staff. This seems to me, whether the allegations are true or false, to be yet another example of wholly improper behaviour. It may well be that the character involved would not have his credentials verified if the Austrian electorate are foolish enough to support him.
(DE) Madam President, I wanted to speak because these cross border payments are very advantageous and indicate that, through a positive solution and the elimination of further barriers, the European Union is consciously relating to citizens and is establishing regulations that will make things easier for them in their day to day lives. I am firmly convinced about this report and am therefore positive that we have taken a significant step forwards here in facilitating activities within the European Union. I hope that this will set a precedent for other areas.
I think we all agree that we need to fight fraud, but let us not crack down on legal transfers of money. We may think that the result of such actions will lead to the removal of low-tax regimes and that we will all have to pay higher taxes, and I know that is something that, particularly on the other side of the House, people welcome. But we also have to understand the unintended consequences of our actions sometimes, and if we seek to crack down too much on lower-tax regimes and lower-tax areas, rather than just driving money from one country to another, we will drive much-needed capital, much-needed innovation and much-needed entrepreneurship out of Europe altogether.
I agree with the comments that have been made about tax competition being a good thing. I think it is a good thing. I think anybody who looked at this independently would say it is a good thing. People often say, well, isn't it easy for you - you have 12.5% corporation tax in Ireland, and I say, well why don't you have a 12.5% corporation tax in your country, if that is the problem? But there is an issue here, and we need to put down the marker about tax evasion. That is a criminal offence, and we really have to ensure that we do not become too close to those who practise these types of evasions.
My political group, the PPE-DE, in an agreement with the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has only supported technical improvements to the text and through our additional amendment proposals we have brought the text passed by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection closer to the working text of the Council. The PPE-DE did not support Amendments 17 and 54 which were passed in committee, because it agreed with the Commission proposal - we are opposed to the introduction of intra-state markings, because they represent a barrier to the internal market and we agree that Member States should eliminate all national references demonstrating conformity other than the CE mark.
(NL) This resolution certainly contains a few positive elements, such as a call to strengthen Frontex's mandate and to take initiatives for a European internal security policy, which should complement national security plans. In the end, I decided to vote against it, though, because I find it totally unacceptable that this Parliament, which, after all, is supposed to represent Europe's citizens, should tenaciously cling to the Lisbon Treaty. The appeal to submit proposals at the earliest opportunity to make the import of foreign workers easier likewise failed to meet with my approval and, in my view, warranted a 'no' vote.
Madam President, a couple of weeks ago I was having one of my favourite meals, a curry, in the village of Long Buckby near to where I live, and I was hosting a group of people who are new to politics in a political discussion. Like everybody - and you all know this - as a Member of the European Parliament they immediately think a number of things. Firstly, that you are on the gravy train and you do not really care about ordinary people, and secondly that Europe is not working: there are too many regulations. Maybe in some cases they are right - there should be a cost-benefit analysis of what the regulations are - and they are badly implemented, in fact not uniformly implemented across the continent.
Therefore, we need better monitoring - I think we all agree - of the application of Community law. So when I have constituents in London and cheesemongers complaining to me about the fact that they have had to invest lots of money to make sure, for example, that the facilities they use to sell cheese meet EU standards that have been gold plated by British civil servants, and then they travel across to other Member States and see cheese being sold openly in street markets and melting and they wonder about the application of Community laws in other countries, it is time for us to show that we are strict about application of Community law right across the EU.
Madam President, I just wondered if it was actually in order for Mr Kamall to urge the European Parliament to ignore the Treaties and ignore its legal obligations and, indeed, to increase the powers of the European Parliament in addressing the issue of the buildings in three different locations. He knows perfectly well that, unfortunately, it is the governments of the Member States who decide on the seats of the institutions and, unfortunately, under the chairmanship of the former leader of his party, John Major, at the Edinburgh Summit in 1992, they imposed a legal obligation on the European Parliament to have 12 part-sessions a year in Strasbourg.
I voted for the European Parliament resolution on women's rights in Afghanistan, because I believe that the new draft law on the personal status of Shiite women is unacceptable. This legislation, which was recently approved by both chambers of the Afghan Parliament, places severe restrictions on women's freedom of movement, legitimises 'marital rape' and promotes discrimination against women in the areas of marriage, divorce, inheritance and access to education. This is not consistent with international standards of human rights in general, nor with women's rights.
The link that people have repeatedly attempted to make between members of the Iranian resistance and terrorism is unjustified, as newspapers, politicians and courts have been able to prove. On the contrary, the situation in Camp Ashraf is in the public domain and numerous people, including members of parliament and journalists, have visited the camp and drawn their own conclusions. The residents of Camp Ashraf are protected persons under the Geneva Convention. For these reasons, the signal sent by the European Parliament is vitally important: the Camp Ashraf residents have a right to be protected and not to be handed over, under any circumstances, to the Iranian regime. This is a question of the most basic respect for human rights. We therefore hope that this resolution will bear fruit.
I constantly emphasise that people with disabilities must be treated just as people without disabilities are treated. This means not only with noble declarations and legal regulations, but above all in the practical matters of everyday life. The principles of the Convention are as follows: respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one's own choices, and respect for the independence of persons, non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, respect for difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity, equality of opportunity, accessibility, equality between men and women, respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities and respect for the right of children with disabilities to preserve their identities.
in writing. - (EL) The Greek Communist Party did not vote for the report on the conclusion, by the EU, of the UN Convention and Protocol on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, because it considers that the EU is not entitled to sign and ratify such agreements with the UN on behalf of the 27 Member States. The signature on the part of the EU infringes every concept of independence and sovereignty of the Member States of the EU, which are members of the UN and have the right and obligation to sign. In this particular case, the Greek Communist Party supports the Convention and Protocol on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the obligation of the Member States to apply it, despite the fact that this matter relates to the overall policy of the capitalist countries which apply an inhumane policy towards people who need special care.
in writing. - British Conservatives share to some extent the concerns in this report that there are serious civil liberties issues about some abuses in the practice of carrying out profiling in a small minority of cases, and welcomes the fact that the European Parliament is seeking to draw this to the attention of Member State governments. We believe, however, that our law enforcement authorities need to be able to use adequate tools for them to carry out their tasks effectively, of which profiling, particularly intelligence-led profiling, is one.
Ethically speaking, no individual can or should be placed in detention of any kind unless there are acts that provide a basis for charging him or that provide evidence of his guilt. In order to contain the problem of immigration and terrorism, we have now reached the stage of developing 'profiles': this method has been created by police organisations and is able to identify, in advance, associations of people considered to be potential advocates of terrorist and criminal activities. One of the most effective methods of profiling goes by the name of 'data mining', and consists of seeking out persons, using computerised databases, through indicators that have been drawn up in advance and which are based on race, ethnicity, religion and nationality.
in writing. - (SV) The June List supports the wording that expresses the need to address profiling carried out by automated data 'mining' in a political debate, as it deviates from the general rule that decisions relating to combating crime should be based on a person's behaviour. We are strongly opposed to ethnic profiling, which entails the arbitrary use of information by the authorities on grounds of race, skin colour, language, religion, nationality and ethnic origin, among other things, and we see an obvious risk that innocent people may be subjected to arbitrary detention.
in writing. - (EL) The report deals with the method used by repressive mechanisms and secret services in the EU, based on the standards of similar mechanisms in the USA, to standardise and classify persons as suspects of 'terrorist' and criminal activity on the basis of their ethnicity or race, their behaviour, their political, social, religious and ideological persuasions and their social action. Of course, this method is not new. The repressive mechanisms of the bourgeoisie have a rich history of criminal activity against communists and social fighters for whom this classification was used in order to label them as being dangerous to 'public order and security'. Today, on the pretext of 'terrorism', they are hauled in again from the darkest ages in the history of the bourgeoisie in Europe.
The objective is to reduce the negative effects of plant protection products as much as possible by reducing the risks. In order to measure this we need indicators and in order to develop these indicators we need reliable data, determined by statistics, which ensure comparability between Member States. That is why I voted in favour of the report. However, we must not forget that only those who market the products in accordance with the regulations will provide data. Up-to-date reports on the Europe-wide illegal trade in pesticides indicate that this needs to be brought more firmly into our sights. The same applies to the importing of products from third countries. We need to step up our controls in this regard.
I am very pleased that today's plenary session has eliminated some serious shortcomings from the proposed regulation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products, which were inserted into this technical standard by the socialist rapporteur. The shadow rapporteur Zita Pleštinská deserves our applause. It is thanks to her professional experience and diligence in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection that the current version is of a professional standard. Through harmonisation and the CE mark for batch production there will be simplification and reduced costs particularly for small firms. The disparate requirements of the 27 Member States will no longer apply. The CE mark of conformity for batch production provides a sufficient guarantee that products conform to European standards. Harmonisation is not necessary for prototypes and one-off products. Only if construction products are imported into countries where there is an earthquake risk, for example, will they have to fulfil the requirements for those specific conditions as well. I appreciate the Czech Presidency's support for this version.
Up until 1 January 2006, it applied only to transfers, withdrawals from automatic teller machines and to payments made with a debit or credit card up to EUR 12 500 in EU countries, whereas, from that date, the amount has been increased to EUR 50 000. This change has led to a fall in prices and greater competition on the payment services markets. Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 also has drawbacks, however, such as the failure to define 'corresponding payments' and the failure to include a review clause, and it is necessary to take action on these points immediately.
I voted for this report because in Romania as well as in other Member States we are sometimes faced with crises which affect public and animal health safety in relation to animal products, such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, dioxin, swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. Such crises can also have a wider adverse impact on the socio-economic situation of farmers and the industrial sectors affected, including a decline in consumer confidence in the safety of animal products. Disease outbreaks can also have adverse consequences for the environment: disposal of the bodies and biodiversity. We needed to review the regulation on animal by-products (ABP) not intended for human consumption from a legislative perspective.
The Hamon report advocates the general use of exchange of information, which is a bureaucratic and ultimately inefficient system. I am in favour of a withholding tax, that is, enabling each citizen to pay his tax in full to the Member State of which he is a taxpayer, by paying a reasonable tax (20 or even 25%). This tax should be applied to natural and legal persons, should be collected at source by the financial body where money (securities, bonds, and so on) is managed, and should be transferred to the taxpayer's taxation department. Ideally it should be made a Community resource.
in writing. - (SV) It is very important to create sound systems which prevent tax fraud. This applies, in particular, to value added tax. However, we believe that, in their current form, the Commission's proposal and the report before us raise more questions than they provide answers to. The EU has a long-term ambition to reduce the regulatory burden. The Commission's proposal seems to be heading in the opposite direction and runs the risk of increasing the administrative burden, in particular for small businesses in Europe. The proposal also contains wordings which will result in large changes to Swedish legislation.
in writing. - (NL) This resolution certainly contains a few positive elements, such as a call to reinforce Frontex's mandate and to take initiatives for a European internal security policy, which should complement national security plans.In the end, I decided to vote against it, though, because I find it totally unacceptable that this Parliament, which, after all, is supposed to represent Europe's citizens, should tenaciously cling to the Lisbon Treaty.The appeal to submit proposals at the earliest opportunity to make the import of foreign workers easier likewise failed to meet with my approval.
in writing. - (NL) Although I voted against this resolution, I wanted to make clear that it certainly contains many positive elements, not least with regard to the reinforcement of Frontex and a better, complementary European internal security policy. The key problem for me, though, remains the fact that Parliament tenaciously clings to the Lisbon Treaty as if it were the great saviour. Naturally, we will not make any progress in this way. It remains a fight to the finish, and eventually, only democracy and the credibility of a democratic European project are set to suffer. Needless to say, I completely disagree with extending the application of the 'blue card' system. This is something I feared from the beginning, and this fear has become reality. As ever, the typical European salami policy, whereby decisions are taken piecemeal and the effects of subsequent decisions are kept secret in the meantime, must be rammed down our throats.
The G20 Summit and the awareness of the need for a coordinated and cooperative response to the current world economic situation are an expression of the positive side to globalisation. No longer are there solitary powers, independent economies or dispensable globalised countries. On the contrary, those countries experiencing much worse conditions than these 'victims' of the crisis, but which have not been involved in globalisation, as is the case with most of the African countries, still have their problems and remain outside the solution. That is the problem to which no solution is being given.
To support ever-increasing integration, chiefly between young people, it is our duty to back the increase in funding and the number of study grants available in the EU for students and researchers from the western Balkans within the framework of the Erasmus Mundus programme. This will not only represent another educational opportunity for many youngsters, but it will allow many young people to get to know personally other people of their own age within the EU, so that they feel themselves to be full citizens of Europe, each with his own identity, but united in diversity.
in writing. - (NL) All in all, this resolution has been drafted in balanced terms. Nevertheless, I voted against it because a 'yes' vote would imply that I support the Lisbon Treaty and the accession of all the Western Balkans countries. Both my party and the absolute majority of Europeans are opposed to the Lisbon Treaty, should they be given the opportunity to vote, and to further accessions. This Parliament may ignore the wishes and lamentations of the European citizen, but I certainly do not.
in writing. - (NL) Two key reasons prevented me from supporting this resolution. First of all, I think we need an absolute ban on enlargement, except for Croatia. We should first try to keep the 25 or 26 current EU Member States on track and make them run efficiently. Rushing to further enlargements and a Lisbon Treaty that has come about in an undemocratic manner is absolutely not the way forward. There is no doubt that the forthcoming European elections will once again reveal the voters' large-scale apathy where European issues are concerned. What do we expect, though, when voters see that their views are not taken into consideration anyway?
in writing. - (NL) Bosnia-Herzegovina is mainly inhabited by three peoples, none of whom are in the majority in that country. Some of these people feel a very strong bond with Serbia, others with Croatia and a third group would like to underline its own independent Bosnian identity. In actual fact, this is a pocket-sized Yugoslavia, a federation in which different peoples have the option of either living together peacefully or battling out internal conflict over their territory.
Although we acknowledge the proposal for a Nuclear Weapons Convention, Britain is concerned that we do not risk at this time diverting attention from, or undermining, the NPT and so warmly welcome the European Parliament resolution to restate our backing as a Parliament to this Treaty. We warmly welcome President Obama's and Prime Minister Gordon Brown's recent statements calling for nuclear reductions and Labour MEPs will continue to give our strong backing to all moves to reduce nuclear stockpiles and avoid proliferation, and we will continue to hold all states accountable to their NPT obligations.
I voted in favour of Mrs Beer's report and I would like to stress that the importance of this document is due precisely to the obvious need to increase the use of nuclear energy for civilian purposes. We are well aware of the problems that arise from a lack of energy independence. We are also just as aware of the contribution of nuclear energy as a clean form of energy to the battle against global warming. Nowadays, the only way to generate clean energy on a large scale is to use nuclear. I hope that we will have the framework for using it safely in order to meet the needs of developing economies and European citizens.
in writing. - Conservatives have been consistent advocates of a strong non-proliferation regime and a multilateral approach toward nuclear-weapon reduction, firmly opposing any proposals aimed at unilateral nuclear disarmament. We welcome a new drive to improve the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, including a Security Council resolution to close loopholes in the existing legal framework. However, we reject the implication that the EU should replace Member States as the major actor in the process. Only two EU members are nuclear-weapon states (NWS), with an additional four participating in NATO nuclear weapons sharing. We do not support the proposal that the UK should dismantle fissile material production facilities. The report also pays insufficient attention to the danger of proliferation by terrorists and rogue states, as opposed to retention or replacement of weapons by the existing five NWS. Several amendments would have considerably worsened the report, including the proposal that the EU should become a 'nuclear-weapons-free zone'. For these reasons, taking into account that there is much in the report we can support, the British Conservative delegation abstained.
Ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago marked the fifth anniversary of the biggest enlargement in the history of the European Union. On 1 May 2004, seventy-five million people from ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Mediterranean - namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus - expressed their pleasure at becoming citizens of the European Union. This enlargement was followed in 2007 by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
The fact that this was possible was one of the most amazing developments of our time. After the people of Central and Eastern Europe had suffered sixty years of oppression, the enlargement of the EU represented the completion of the reunification of our continent, based on the shared values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and human dignity. As a result of this process, the EU has gained in strength, diversity and cultural richness. The enlargement process was, and is, an enriching experience for every single Member State, as well as for the EU as a whole.
Five years after that historical moment, enlargement has proved to be a great success for the EU. Its significance for the everyday lives of our citizens has continued to increase. After the servitude of Communism, the enlargement process contributed to making democracy a reality and to strengthening stability on our continent. Enlargement improved the standard of living in the new Member States and provided a powerful stimulus for the whole European economy, as the old Member States also benefited from the new export and investment opportunities, as well as a larger market. In essence, the accession of twelve new countries has strengthened the position of the EU worldwide, and has lent it more weight as an international political and economic actor.
Now we must turn to a rather worrying fact: I wish to express our profound concern regarding the tragic situation facing the US-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi, who has been sentenced to eight years in prison for allegedly spying on behalf of the US, and is currently being held in the Evin prison in Tehran. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to join the President of the European Council, and the President of the US, in demanding Roxana Saberi's immediate and unconditional release.
The case of Roxana Saberi reflects the dramatic overall situation in Iran in terms of human rights, which, since 2005 - especially in relation to civil and political rights - has continued to deteriorate, in spite of the fact that, within the framework of existing international instruments, Iran has made a commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. The sentencing of Mrs Saberi comes at a critical moment: two months before the presidential elections in Iran, and only a short time after efforts were initiated by the US and the EU to improve relations with Iran.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I find this line of argument beyond belief. It is not a question of ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon here today. We only want to be prepared for when it is ratified. If it is not, then everything we have decided will be wasted. However, if it is ratified - and this would then take place in October - this Parliament will have to work differently from November onwards. It would be really irresponsible of us not to be prepared. That is why this debate is necessary and why a decision must be taken.
Mr President, we propose including on the agenda a debate on the reform of the common fisheries policy, bearing in mind the presentation by the European Commission on 22 April of the Green Paper on the reform of this important common policy, and also bearing in mind the profound implications for this strategic sector and for fishermen of some of the proposals contained in that Green Paper. For that matter, a proposal to include this issue on the agenda has already been made by this Parliament's Committee on Fisheries, given the political importance and topicality of this debate. This part-session is the last opportunity for the current Parliament to express its opinion on this issue.
At the end of this term, I should like to pay tribute to the activities of Parliament's Baltic Europe Intergroup, which has drawn practical conclusions from the last enlargement, with the Baltic Sea becoming, in fact, the Union's internal sea. It has initiated a new European policy - the Baltic Sea strategy. We can be truly satisfied that, under the creative and skilful leadership of Christopher Beazley, the Baltic Sea strategy has won the support of the Commission and will soon be introduced by the Swedish Presidency. Therefore, I strongly suggest that the activities of this intergroup be continued in the next European Parliament.
Mr President, on behalf of one of my constituents I want to raise the case of a young man with dual British/Greek nationality named John Zafiropoulos. Last year he was convicted by a first-degree Greek court to serve an unconscionably severe sentence in prison in Greece. From the information I have been given, Mr President, I consider that the crucial rules relating to Greek legislation, as well as the provisions for fair trials, have been violated. These fair trial provisions are defined by all of Europe and are the rights of every European citizen.
At the start of this year I wrote to the Greek Minister of Justice in Athens to alert him to my concerns. The response which I received, three months later, was signed by minor Ministry employees and made no reference to the matter which I had raised with the Minister - in other words, the breaking of the rules about fair trials. I am very concerned about this, Mr President, and for this reason I am raising it in Parliament right now, hoping that Athens will both send me a proper reply and deliver a full and fair review of the case of Mr Zafiropoulos.
(PL) Mr President, out of concern for the future of Europe, I would like today, in Strasbourg in the last session of this parliamentary term, to recall the words of our great countryman, the Holy Father John Paul II, who said, 'There will be no European unity until unity is based on unity of the spirit'. It was Christianity which gave Europe this deepest foundation of unity and strengthened it for centuries, the Christian Gospel with its understanding of mankind and its contribution to the development of history, peoples and nations. This does not mean we are using history for our own ends, for the history of Europe is like a great river, into which flow manifold tributaries and streams, and the diversity of traditions and cultures which have created Europe is its great wealth. The basis of European identity is itself built on Christianity, and the present lack of spiritual unity is mainly the result of the crisis in our awareness of that Christian identity.
Mr President, over the last five years I have watched in horror the EU's endless scandalous institutionalised looting of taxpayers' money. I watched in horror an already overcrowded UK deluged by hundreds and thousands of uninvited foreign workers who arrive for their benefit and claim our welfare. I watched in close-up a legislative system that permits anonymous bureaucrats to generate so-called law without any regard for the damage they do to the British economy and its businesses. I watched in close-up -
In my country at the moment the so-called UK Independence Party - the party that Mr Mote was elected for - has posters across the country claiming that the European Union costs us EUR 400 million per day in membership. That would be EUR 15 billion per year - a figure that is actually five times higher than the factual figure, which you can get from the House of Commons library. Not to be outdone, their donor, Stuart Wheeler, has said it costs GBP 120 billion per year, some 36 times the real figure.
If I mention these two options, it is with the accession process of the countries of the former Yugoslavia and of Albania in mind. Listening to and reading the positions adopted by the Commission and by my fellow Members, I rather feel that it is the profession of clerk that they identify with, with their strict, scrupulous noting of the chapters accomplished, and their adding, where necessary, of additional stages such as bilateral problems between Slovenia and Croatia. I believe that we are making a fundamental mistake.
- (SK) 1 May this year marked the 5th anniversary of Slovakia's accession to the EU. Various activities took place on the day, at which we weighed up our activities in the EU. I took part in celebrations on the Slovak-Polish border at the border bridge of Čirč-Leluchov. This symbolic bridge, which was constructed with pre-accession funding from the EU, has united Slovak and Polish communities in the border region and has kick-started cooperation between citizens on both sides of the border.
(BG) We have witnessed over recent months a number of incidents involving the hijacking of ships by Somali pirates for ransom. There is a danger that this practice is turning into a well-organised form of maritime terrorism and a lucrative business, with consultancy and law firms even becoming involved as intermediaries. A happy ending for the hostages in these cases must not be greeted with delight as the ship owners and countries affected pay a high price for it. Piracy is becoming a threat to shipping on a global scale.
This activity has started affecting an ever-increasing number of European citizens too. There are currently 16 Bulgarians who are being held captive on the ship Malaspina Castle. Monitoring the negotiations with the pirates cannot be accepted as an adequate policy. We need greater clarity as to what commitments the European Union assumes in such situations. The measures currently being taken by various institutions are important, but are obviously completely inadequate. This is why I am insisting on urgent action at the highest level to free the hostages and bring this activity under control, which is a disgrace in the 21st century.
(EL) Mr President, we are celebrating the anniversary of the accession of new countries to the European Union and we were all delighted and moved by your statement. However, I imagine that the present Commissioner, like me and many other fellow Members, is thinking that one of the countries which joined, namely Cyprus, is still occupied in the north and that there are foreign troops there. The European Union is being called on again today to ensure that the Community acquis applies to the whole of the island of Cyprus.
Mr President, it would be good if the European Commission could also set an example in this regard. After all, at a time of crisis, it would have a significant impact on the EU's reputation, trustworthiness and prestige if commissioners were to give up part of their hefty severance pay. Even if it is a symbolic gesture, it would give a signal to Europe's citizens that during an economic crisis, EU leaders are also prepared to make sacrifices and are showing solidarity with those on more modest incomes.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on a personal note, I would simply like to reiterate that contrary to your assertion, and other than this you have been consistent throughout this parliamentary term, for the last 30 years I have always been re-elected to this Parliament. What happened was that within the team spirit of the Radical Party, and having advised the voters in advance, I gave up my seat to other colleagues such as Olivier Dupuis, who served in this House and elsewhere. What you said was therefore incorrect, let me repeat, I was re-elected every time, for 30 years.
Unfortunately, this time, Mr President - although you were in fact here in the days of Otto von Habsburg and Altiero Spinelli, who encouraged our Parliament to make a real stand against the Council's demands by refusing to issue opinions - well, Mr President, this time we have both witnessed this Parliament content to behave like a 'taxi parliament' when faced with the desire to impose non-parliamentary timelines on us - and you did impose them - in relation to the failed Lisbon project.
Mr President, I rise to express my concern about thousands of innocent civilians who have been turned into refugees in their own homeland by the Taliban in the Swat Valley. We are all familiar with the stories about mistreatment of women by the Taliban. However, the news coming out of the valley in the last month reports closing of barbershops, banning of music and disabling of satellite television receivers. Also robbing of banks and looting of homes or women's jewellery at gunpoint are common occurrences, especially of those that oppose or that stand up to the Taliban. The introduction of Sharia law in the Swat Valley has also resulted in all non-Muslims living in the valley having to pay jizya, an ancient form of tax, and I understand that the Sikhs living in the area were kidnapped or threatened until they agreed to pay. As the only Sikh MEP, I have been contacted by numerous constituents who are horrified as to what is happening in the Swat Valley - people who have lived there for 60 years are discriminated against in this way.
This Parliament has a proud history and record of fighting against these forms of violations of human rights and denouncing those that are exercising these intimidatory actions. However, we need to go beyond just statements and ask for concrete action from the Commission to make sure that we have a strategy as to how we address the Taliban and their rising influence in that region. Taliban are the real threat to all the values that we hold dear, human rights, equality and democracy. I urge you to write to the Commissioner to take some action.
Thank you, Mrs Gill. This is also the last time that I will preside over the one-minute speeches. I have always tried to allow as many people to speak as possible. We have often been able to get through the entire list - as we were indeed able to do this evening - for it is one of the privileges of the MEPs to be able to speak, and Monday evenings always provide an opportunity to do so. Therefore, I would also like to thank you sincerely for what you have told us.
It is clear that we all benefit from our integrated European economy and society. However, that benefit also brings a responsibility. It means that we must work together to take only those measures that are justified by the evidence. This is essential if we are to avoid a health crisis becoming an economic crisis as well. But we should not focus unduly on the negative aspects of these events. Thanks to the preparation led by the Commission after avian influenza a few years ago, the EU has the systems in place to respond collectively and effectively to this threat.
I know that in recent times, as the European elections approach, this House has debated what Europe really means for citizens. In these difficult days, I think we can see some things more clearly. Europe means solidarity in standing together to face this threat. It means cooperation, sharing information, expertise and capacity so that we can act together on the basis of the best available knowledge. It means innovation, with European-funded research helping to bring a vaccine to production as quickly as possible. It means capability, through the European institutions enabling all Member States to respond immediately and effectively to a shared crisis. That is what Europe brings to citizens.
The first is the plans which we have and which have already been processed by the Council, the European Commission and Parliament in connection with avian influenza. We therefore have plans which are, in fact, quite good, despite the fact that certain omissions were criticised by specialist scientists. I should therefore like to ask if these plans have been completed, if the Member States have adopted them and if they are ready to be applied, as the weakest link is very important here, and finally, there is the coordination which you have mentioned; I am delighted to hear that you are ready to undertake it jointly with the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for this entire influenza story.
The third issue that I should like to raise is that it would be useful if we could find a vaccine for the new influenza. This vaccine will be very important and I believe that today, with the techniques at our disposal, companies could have it ready in three to four months. So I would like you to exert pressure in this direction to ensure that an effort really is made to ensure that we have a new vaccine which, together with the vaccine for seasonal influenza, which you have rightly extended in order to combat this influenza for all the known scientific reasons, would constitute the best barrier to a possible influenza pandemic.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, it would seem that the flu pandemic is not as bad as expected. We have been lucky again, just as we were with SARS - yet this is not down to the decision-makers, Mr President. When the flu threat became known during the weekend, they agreed to meet for urgent talks on the Thursday - which strikes me as a redefinition of the word 'urgent'. Subsequently, nothing much was decided. What happens if there is a real crisis?
What happens in the event of the 'big one' - which the World Health Organization is convinced is coming, and may well claim eight to 10 million lives? The ministers met to exchange information, and plans were made. Yet what was the quality of the plans, and of the exchange of information? What measures have been taken, and are these actually coordinated? Is the Commission receiving all the necessary information? I have my doubts. Taking the example of the antiviral drugs: who has, and who does not have, these? Also, are the ministers now prepared, at long last, to create a European emergency stockpile?
Although I am not convinced that France's proposal to ground all flights to Mexico was a good one, the Council's decision that everyone should make up their own minds whether to do this is, of course, crazy. With our open borders, what is the point of one country doing it if another does not? The countries should have taken that decision together. The only solution to this is to empower the Commission to take this kind of emergency measures. You, Commissioner, by order of the Council, should be able to take contingency measures within 24 hours on such issues as quarantine, disinfection measures at airports and travel restrictions.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join those who have thanked you, Commissioner, for the comprehensive information you have given us. Yet I agree with Mr Trakatellis and Mr Maaten. We did hold an extensive debate in this House in June 2006. We adopted a resolution, on which we worked hard at the time in Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I have looked again at that resolution and I must say that, like Mr Trakatellis, I fear that there are a great many gaps, many weaknesses in the current approach.
Mr President, speaking on the subject of the threat posed by the influenza virus I would like to quote some of the opinions of Internet users which have appeared as a response to the panic in the media, which has been given an additional stimulus by comments made by the World Health Organization. It is being said that the cause of the media hysteria is a desire to get rid of stocks of vaccines and the ineffective drug Tamiflu which are taking up shelf space in pharmaceutical warehouses, and an attempt to divert attention from the world crisis.
Despite the subsidiarity of healthcare, infectious diseases know no boundaries and oblige us to take joint action. There can be no solution within the framework of a single country. It is time for solidarity. Slovakia is sufficiently prepared even for an expansion of the influenza infection into a larger epidemic, perhaps because of the earlier avian influenza. We have 700 000 Tamiflu doses in national reserves for 5 million inhabitants and I must say that it is also perhaps on account of the earlier threat of avian influenza that the populace is definitely well-prepared.
In case of an epidemic it is very important to keep the public informed, because where there is no information there will be plenty of disinformation. We can see this from a number of African countries, for example Egypt where the current threat of an influenza epidemic coupled with the idea that the disease was spread by pigs has led to 300 000 - 400 000 pigs being slaughtered. However, we should perhaps show solidarity in this case in other ways, since travel agencies were selling holidays in these destinations but now people are travelling there only in case of need. As we have Eurolat, we should also think about supporting Mexico, where it is believed that this infection will cause GDP to decline by up to 4 - 5% from current levels.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would be interested to know whether there are any statistics available on face masks. How many masks are available in Europe, and what quantities could be produced in the event of an outbreak of this kind of disease? The same goes for the medication available, of course. Is there an overview of how much medication is currently stored in Europe and how much could be produced in the event of an outbreak? Do you think that it would be possible to also provide information for doctors in the 23 languages of the European Union, so that information could be provided rapidly and efficiently?
Certain Members have said that there is insufficient information. In Germany, I feel that I have been provided with sufficient information on how I should behave. I also do not wish to always make Europe responsible for everything. It is the Member States that are responsible for providing this information. We should also take this opportunity to remind them that they need to fulfil their duty to provide information. I have also heard, on a number of occasions, that there are still certain shortcomings, particularly relating to the stockpiling of vaccines. I would be interested to know whether this is really the case, whether the Member States really do not want to share vaccines and whether they are only storing them for use on their territory, or whether they have agreed to share the vaccines. Then we would be at the same stage as the Commission is now. I would like to express my thanks for this rapid and excellent work. Congratulations!
Many speakers mentioned antivirals and the sufficiency of stocks. Unfortunately, as you know, my predecessor discussed this problem of stockpiling on an EU basis with the health ministers but unfortunately those ministers did not want Europe to take over this coordination. We discussed the same problem last year in Angers during the French Presidency and, again, the health ministers insisted that each Member State should be free to decide for itself how many stocks it wanted. We know that there are many differences between the stocks from one state to another, and we are concerned about that.
As far as the new vaccine is concerned, as I said, I had a meeting with industry and we discussed at length the need both for antivirals and for the new vaccine. We hope that on 11 May 2009 we shall have the seed stocks to give to the industry in order for it to begin production of the new vaccine. I cannot say when it will be ready, as it will depend on the efficacy of the stock, but we estimate that it will take between 8 and 12 weeks.
After several trialogues and three sessions of the Conciliation Committee, it became clear in the last session shortly after midnight and shortly before the expiry of the deadline that it would not be possible to come to an agreement. The European Parliament delegation had previously voted with a clear majority of 15 votes in favour, none against and five abstentions to oppose the final conciliation attempt of the Commission. This proposal was not accepted as the basis for a genuine compromise. At the same time, it was also rejected by the Permanent Representatives Committee which was meeting in the neighbouring room. In a letter dated 29 April 2009, the two co-chairmen of the Conciliation Committee informed Parliament and the Council of Ministers that it was not possible to come to an agreement on a joint text within the deadline specified in Article 251(5) of the EC Treaty.
The Council in particular did not move an inch on the question of the opt-out. Parliament offered several compromises which would have given the employers' side a great deal of flexibility on working times. Parliament was particularly cooperative on the question of the conditions of on-call time, because the majority of Member States, in this case nine, use the opt-out exclusively for on-call time. However, a blocking minority in the Council prevented every attempt to introduce a derogation. Not even a suggestion of an end to the opt-out was accepted.
On the subject of on-call time, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has made it clear that on-call time is working time. Even the inactive part of on-call time cannot be considered in whole or in part to be a rest period, as the Council demanded. It was also obvious to the Parliament delegation that on-call time is necessary when a continuation of work is required. The Council was not prepared to accept this restriction. What is the result of this? If a waiter sits in an empty restaurant, this counts as inactive on-call time which will, of course, be evaluated differently. This must not be the case. Taking a flexible approach, Parliament also supported the proposal for a maximum working time of 48 hours per worker and not per contract. In this case we could not even agree on this principle being laid down in a recital.
During this parliamentary term, Parliament has adopted 389 legal acts in the codecision procedure. Of these, 24 were concluded at the third reading following successful conciliation. This demonstrates clearly that there is a culture of cooperation between the institutions. For the first time since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Conciliation Committee has failed to reach an agreement in the case of the Working Time Directive. I hope that the new Commission will very soon present a new proposal which will, I hope, lead to an agreement.
A qualified majority of Member States have agreed that the key disputed issue of the opt-out will be left in the directive, but with strongly defined conditions which will tighten up its application considerably. The Council, for example, wanted to reduce the maximum weekly working time when using the opt-out from 78 hours to 60 or 65 hours and proposed banning the use of opt-outs when signing an employment contract or limiting the period of consent given by employees to work in an opt-out regime to one year. The Council's aim was to restrict the use of opt-out in the Member States, but primarily to enhance the protection of employees who are using the opt-out. The Council viewed its draft directive as a well-balanced document promoting employee protection, and hoped it would also prove acceptable to Parliament, which was expected to approve it at the second reading.
Since the vote last December, the Czech Presidency has been well aware of the different attitudes of the two institutions towards the draft directive, but has not regarded the negotiating procedure as a fight for prestige between the two institutions. Instead, it has taken a pragmatic, non-ideological and realistic approach, taking account of the realities of the European labour market. It is an indisputable fact that the opt-out is used today by 15 of the 27 EU Member States. Since January this year, when the Czech Republic took over the Presidency, we have pursued very intense negotiations at all levels in an effort to find space for a possible compromise with Parliament. The first meeting of the Member States on this topic was held in Prague on 13 January. At least eight rounds of informal trialogues have been held to date, as well as three rounds of the negotiating process proper. At this point I would like to thank the Commission, and especially Commissioner Špidla, for its specialist assistance and constructive approach in searching for a possible compromise over the wording of the directive. The Council was willing to agree and to compromise on the common position, but despite this no agreement has been reached. Over the past four months, the Czech Presidency has been very active and responsible in holding talks with Parliament and submitting many compromise solutions to Parliament on various issues regarding the directive in a bid to find a final solution acceptable to the Council and to Parliament.
Today I can state that the Council made a number of concessions to meet the demands of Parliament, and yet these were not enough for Parliament. For example, the Council was prepared to abandon the common position and to endorse Parliament's view that all on-call time is indeed work time. The Council also made concessions during the debate on harmonising work and family life in the deadline for providing supplementary daytime rest and in the definition of top-ranking employees, and I could list further examples. The Council wanted to come to an agreement with Parliament over the key issue of the opt-out and was prepared to accommodate Parliament's demands and to accept its other proposals, for example a ban on arranging opt-outs during the probationary period and removal of the maximum weekly working time for the opt-out, even though we naturally felt that we were acting against the interests of employees. We were even prepared to accept the idea of introducing registration of hours actually worked in the opt-out. However, Parliament did not even go half way to meet the Council's position.
Speaking on behalf of the Czech Presidency, I am frankly sorry that Parliament was unwilling to compromise and to agree on a revised directive, which has been awaited not only by Member States but also by EU citizens for five long years. Agreement on a revised directive would contribute to greater protection for employees, would help in solving the problem of on-call time and rest, and would pave the way towards a gradual reduction in the use of opt-outs in the Member States. However, the MEPs in the negotiating committee were deaf to these proposals. They refused to accept them and they refused to accept the Council's counter proposals and the compromises offered by the Commission, insisting instead on their own ideological position. Since Parliament was unwilling to respect the situation in the Council and the realities of the current situation, the existing directive will remain in force. Use of the opt-out will not be restricted, no monitoring will be introduced, and workers will have to continue working up to 78 hours a week. In all probability, the attitude of Parliament will lead to greater use of the opt-out. The European Commission has received signals today from another two Member States that are intending to introduce the opt-out, and consequently any hopes for its future abolition are further reduced. The Council wanted to prevent this but Parliament has ruled otherwise.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry indeed that the Council and Parliament have failed to reach an agreement in the final round of bargaining over the revision of the Working Time Directive. The Commission has done everything in its power to find a compromise, submitting a range of proposals on all of the main issues in order to help both lawmaking bodies come closer to a final version. In the end, however, the Council and Parliament insisted on their differing standpoints concerning the future of exceptions and the opt-out, which could not be reconciled.
I understand and respect the wish of Parliament to end the use of exceptions with definitive effect. That would also be the ideal solution for me, and we incorporated it into the Commission's amendment to the directive in 2005. Nevertheless, after several years of negotiations, it became quite clear that this element would not facilitate an agreement in the Council, and that it would not overcome the blocking minority. Too many Member States simply insisted on using individual exceptions and on retaining this provision in the directive. That was why the Commission tabled alternative proposals for improving the legal protection of employees who use exceptions, thus weakening their use in practical terms. The Commission also proposed introducing consistent monitoring of the use of exceptions at national and European levels, and imposing restrictions on the simultaneous use of exceptions, which would have reduced the incentive for Member States to grant exceptions. I firmly believe that this approach would in practice actually improve conditions for workers and more importantly, would enhance the long-term prospects for Member States eventually to agree on scrapping exceptions altogether. Parliament took the view that there is no better arrangement than a complete abolition of the opt-out. I respect the grounds for such a decision, but I hold a different opinion.
As I have mentioned on many previous occasions, I firmly believe that the failure to reach agreement on the amendment is a bad message for European workers and enterprises, for European institutions and, by extension, for Europe as a whole. Firstly, this means that the problem of exceptions has not been resolved and exceptions will continue to be used under the existing directive, with no date for their termination, with a very limited number of restrictions and without any special review at all. I know that many of you have raised the objection that workers would work 65 hours a week, and I fully understand those concerns, but the fact is that the current directive allows for a working week of up to 70 hours. Secondly, even though the ruling of the Court of Justice in the matter of on-call time and supplementary time for rest will remain unchanged, I am afraid that in many cases this will not lead to better protection for workers in practice. Many Member States have areas with a high rate of on-call time, and they are facing real problems in adhering to the rules stemming from the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments. The result so far is that more and more Member States have now started using exceptions in order to solve this problem. At present, there are 15 such countries, and I am afraid that now, since there is no agreement in place for on-call time, even more Member States will start using the opt-out in order to comply with the ruling of the European Court of Justice, as they will have no other option available. With an increasing number of Member States using exceptions, it will be much more difficult to reach agreement in the Council on ending the exceptions. Thirdly, the failure of the negotiations means that a series of very significant special guarantees approved by the Council for workers all over Europe who are currently using the exceptions, will not be valid, and will not come into force. And lastly, we have also missed an opportunity for improvement in terms of the measures aimed at harmonising work and family life, and clarifying the definition of the variations for self-employed workers. However, both lawmaking bodies have now taken their decision and the immediate result is that no special reviews of exceptions will be made, as the existing directive requires. I respect that decision. Together with the other members of the Commission we will now have to consider the situation that has arisen as a result of the lawmakers' failure to reach an agreement.
I would also like to say that it is a myth that this is purely the fault of the Council, while the majority of those in Parliament, like knights in shining armour, have sacrificed themselves in the interests of the workers. The reality is that both parties are at fault. In is true that the Council did not move an inch on the question of the opt-out, but the majority in Parliament was equally inflexible in insisting that a solution was only possible if the opt-out was abolished. As a result, both parties passed like ships in the night and the result was easy to predict.
This is a lost opportunity. For example, it would have been possible to put in place a European on-call time regulation which specified for the whole of Europe that 'on-call time is working time', as the Court of Justice of the European Communities has laid down. In order to achieve this it would have been necessary for the majority in Parliament to have moved a very small distance on the question of the opt-out, for example when it was a case of determining the conditions under which an opt-out is possible, which should be as strict as possible, and who takes the decision about the opt-out. The two sides of industry should have been involved. However, none of this happened. The insistence on the removal of the opt-out at all costs became a sacred cow. This was the other side of the irreconcilable behaviour which resulted in the failure of the new solution. This is a very regrettable situation. As I have said, it is not in the interests of the workers.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, though futile efforts lead to melancholy, I wish to repeat that the opt-out should come to an end, because it was intended to last for a ten-year period - which finished in 2003 - and its end is extremely important for people's health, for combining family and professional life, for us to have a discussion that fits with the one we had half an hour ago and the one that will follow, for the international conventions of the International Labour Organization to be respected, for European social law to become a reality, for workers' organisations to remain intact, and for citizens to continue to have faith in European institutions.
They proposed that it be a derogation, as in Article 20; a derogation, not an exception: that it be something normal. At the same time, moreover, the proposal was an unrestrained assault on the legislation of the Court of Justice. It took away doctors' rights and it took away their working conditions. They have never even come close to our idea, or to that of the Court of Justice regarding compensatory rest for doctors. It was an unrestrained attack on workers. What is more, they have accused us of doing this during an election period. It is an honour to listen to citizens and workers.
I support the opt-out of the 48-hour limit of the Working Time Directive as long as it is voluntary. I attempted during committee to tighten this up and make sure that you could not sign the opt-out at the same time as the contract and that you could opt out of the opt-out at any time. Indeed, that is what the Council also proposed. It is important for flexibility, for the worker and the employer alike. Why should someone not be allowed to earn overtime if that is what they choose to do?
This would have been our contribution to the concept of improving the quality of work. Our resolution would have set minimum standards and, at the same time, would have offered a degree of flexibility which would have represented a solution for hospitals. However, the Council has blocked this over a number of weeks and it has finally failed. Unfortunately, the Commission is also partly responsible in this case, because it has not contributed to the process of finding a solution. The Commission proposals have ridden roughshod over labour law and called into question something which would generally have been regarded as a legal minimum standard. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, together with a large majority of the Conciliation Committee, were not prepared to vote in favour of legalised exploitation.
It is well-known that the German Labour Minister and social democrat, Olaf Scholz, was one of the hard core of objectors in the Council. In all seriousness, he wanted to introduce exceptions to a long-term solution which would allow people to work up to 78 hours per week. In Germany he claims to be the representative of the workers, while in Brussels he acts as the spokesperson for those members of the Council who are opposed to the interests of European workers. He has stabbed the Social Democrats in the back.
As President Klaus said, there is a great distance between the citizen and elected EU representatives, but much less within Member States, which makes the EU undemocratic. I agree, and I for one insist on being more representative of the citizens. After all, where there were but four Member States wanting opt-outs in 2004, there are now 15. Does that not tell you anything? And MEPs had the nerve to call 15 states out of 27 a blocking minority - Parliament is in denial!
I can also tell you that we made some progress during the negotiations. Where on-call time and time off in lieu are concerned, I consider it progress that we all said that on-call time counted as working hours. I believe we could have reached agreement there. The reason we did not reach agreement was the opt-out. On the one side was the Council, with a blocking minority that absolutely did not want to remove the opt-out, and on the other - and this is often forgotten - a large majority in the European Parliament that does very much want to get rid of the opt-out because it has nothing to do with health and safety. We Members of Parliament tried, we made a proposal that the Council itself should come up with an end date. In the end we were even willing to say: 'We will simply set a date for further negotiations and for coming up with an end date'. The Council was not willing to accept even this. It then became impossible. It was not the case, Mr Sedláĉek, that the Council accepted all the conditions set by Parliament as regards conditions for the opt-out. When we started negotiations on the last day more or less every suggestion was rejected. I can confirm that there is actually a majority in favour of removing the opt-out. There is a large majority in Parliament and a majority on the Council, but unfortunately it is a minority on the Council that is allowed to decide that the opt-out must remain. This is unsatisfactory. I hope that the Commission will come back, that people will accept their responsibility and that the starting point for a new proposal will be what the directive is about, which is health and safety for workers, and that then the opt-out will have to be phased out.
(EL) Madam President, the Council, hand in hand with the Commission, bears full responsibility for the failure to find a compromise and the reason is simple: it is because you insisted that we accept a compromise which would maintain the opt-out perpetually; you wanted to deceive and humiliate us and millions of workers by turning a provisional exemption granted to Great Britain in 1993 into a permanent, anti-labour regulation. Fortunately, the large majority in the European Parliament said no. Anyone with any doubts as to who bears responsibility need only listen to the speech by the representative of the Czech Presidency: dogmatic neo-liberalism, hard-line ideology, arrogance and a cheap attempt to deceive the European citizens.
Mr Špidla, you do not have the right to interpret and apply judgments by the European Court of Justice 'à la carte'; you have to apply the case law of the European Court of Justice and to institute infringement proceedings against Member States which have failed for years to apply the judgments of the Court. You cannot say that we do not do so, because we are going to revise the directive. Understand one thing: there is no way that Parliament will agree to a compromise which does not abolish the opt-out.
Some investors, especially from East Asian countries, are attempting not only to introduce the East Asian work ethic, against which employees are requesting protection under the law, but are bringing a new phenomenon to the labour market: an attempt to replace domestic workers with East Asian workers who are used to a different work culture and unlimited working hours. In the current crisis situation, with increasing unemployment, the asymmetric relationship between employer and employee is becoming increasingly clear. Therefore limiting working times is all the more necessary, bearing in mind the need for workers' freedoms.
The worrying thing is the subject of that extremism. The Council wants to keep both the opt-out and the yearly calculation of working time. The 78-hour week, I would point out to the Commissioner and to the Council, is arrived at by postponing the rest periods provided by the text that the Council has defended. It therefore represents a worse situation than the previous directive; frankly it is difficult to understand what concept the Council has of work and working conditions, but also of trade unions and contracts.
With regard to the main problem of the opt-out, it is my view that what the Council was offering was legally contradictory and, above all, went against what I consider to be essential elements for a Europe that cannot, and should not, relinquish its social dimension without losing its identity. It was unthinkable to allow into Community legislation a general, permanent law that went against the recommendation of the Commission which, in its social agenda, urges Member States to comply with the International Labour Organization convention. It was also possible to reach an agreement by acting on the set of exceptions and general rules; in addition, we could have made use of the contribution of social stakeholders who, if their independence is respected, can provide fair, effective agreements.
Madam President, when future generations come to judge this Parliament and its work on the working time dossier, I suggest that they will view how MEPs behaved during the trialogue process with sheer incredulity. They will see that here was a directive born and bred in the early 1990s when the Socialists were the largest party in this House and when the Left was running the majority of Member State governments; that here was a directive which, however well intentioned, reflects the standard Socialist dogma that people cannot be relied upon to make their own choices about their own work/life balance, that politicians always know best and that, of course, European politicians know best of all; that here was a directive on working time that has simply never worked.
We have a directive which clearly cannot be implemented, and what has been the reaction of this Parliament? That the people are wrong; that the Member States are wrong; that the Commission is wrong and that all must be forced into this one-size-fits-all strait jacket, which plainly does not fit anybody. Understandably, the Council refused to give way because, like MEPs, Member State governments were elected to open up opportunities for people, not to restrict their freedom. They, however, remembered what certain MEPs have forgotten.
I regret that I have to say - and here I differ from the previous speakers, especially those from the left-hand side of the Chamber - that a significant part of the responsibility for this ending rests with our Parliament, which adopted an unrealistic negotiating strategy. Many countries of Europe have a saying which runs, 'the better is often the enemy of the good'. Unfortunately, I noticed that during the negotiation period this piece of folk wisdom seemed to have been completely forgotten by most of my fellow Members, especially from the left-hand side of the Chamber.
I would like to say something, although doing so will not bring me any satisfaction. I will remind Parliament that during the first meeting of the Conciliation Committee I proposed adoption of a compromise approach, along with recognition that since in most Member States flexible principles of organising working time have been applied for years with the consent of the worker, expecting radical changes is unjustified and may result in blocking of the negotiations. Unfortunately, that is what happened, and I fear this was done with the pre-election campaign in mind, and not with the interests of European workers.
Now we have Philip Bushill-Matthews talking tonight about freedom of choice for workers - the freedom to work the hours they want. Well, Philip, look at the situation in the United Kingdom, the very Member State that has used the general opt-out the longest. According to the European Labour Force Survey, there are 3.5 million workers there working more than 48 hours per week on a regular basis. According to that same survey, 58% of them - almost 60% - say they would like to work less than 48 hours per week. 2.2 million of those 3.5 million in the UK receive no payment for that additional work they do each week. They are not crazy, but are of course being forced to work those hours, and have been put in a position where they have to work additional hours. That is the reality of the use of the opt-out.
The problem of on-call time is a problem first and foremost for those who work in public services, and mainly in the health service, where extending working time means not only worse conditions for doctors and nurses, but also a threat to the safety and health of patients, and in addition civil responsibility of the doctor for malpractice. Freedom of choice in this matter meant that in a hospital in the town of Radom in Poland nobody was employed who did not agree to the procedure. This means that in practice freedom of choice does not exist.
(NL) Madam President, back in 1817, the socially minded British entrepreneur Robert Owen advocated the introduction of the eight-hour working day. In his view, prosperity for everyone was possible if people worked for eight hours and the work was well organised. Then, exactly 125 years ago, the initial impetus was given for the introduction of the eight-hour working day in the United States. It is one of the democratic convictions of our European community that shortening the working week contributes to a life compatible with human dignity. Fortunately, in recent decades, this has been joined by greater attention to the sharing of work and care responsibilities.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, this was a very interesting debate for me. I would like to respond briefly to some of the initiatives. Firstly, I would like to say something that has not been mentioned here, and which must be stated quite frankly. Is it not, by chance, true that Europe has the highest levels of employee protection in the world? I believe this is the case, so any talk about efforts aimed at dismantling this kind of protection, or returning to the 19th century is simply not true. We are only trying to adapt it to the current economy and the global economic situation. We are not living in the 20th century. This is the 21st century, and we work - I would not like to specify the hours - but we work all the time. Can you see this mobile phone, can you see these computers? Each of us receives e-mail messages every day and it is normal to receive them 24 hours a day. At the same time nobody ever calculates how many hours he or she really works. So the attempt being made here - we are talking about some kind of flexibility -is merely an attempt by Europe as whole to adjust to global competition.
You were right, Mr Nassauer, when you said we should agree on the issues, for example the question of on-call time. I would like to say that in this respect the Council has gone quite a long way to meet Parliament and has agreed that on-call time would be regarded as work time, contrary to the common position, which was quite different. The Council even proposed to Parliament that this directive should regulate the issue of on-call time only and leave the issue of the opt-out for another time, but Parliament did not respond to this. Mr Figueredo said that the Council's proposals have undermined the position of working people, but I would like to reiterate a basic point. The Council proposed reducing the number of hours when using opt-out from 78 to 60 or 65, but Mr Cercas rejected that. The Council proposed restrictions both on monitoring and on the introduction of opt-outs. The Council agreed to this but it was still not passed. Mr Andersson is perhaps confused when he says that the Council was unwilling to accept the Commission's compromise proposals. On the contrary, it was the Council - at its COREPER session - that approved those proposals. So the compromise proposed by the Commission was accepted by the Council, but not by Parliament.
I would also like to add that I do not know who talks to which members of the public in the EU. We also talk to members of the public in the EU, but they tell us they want more freedom, they do not want anyone to impose new obligations on them and they do not want politicians to keep interfering in their personal lives. We are now coming up to the 20th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution - the anniversary of the end of communism in Europe - and people want to celebrate that occasion by actually defending their freedom. They do not want more and more regulations and obligations imposed on them.
I would like to say in conclusion only that we are extremely disappointed not to have reached an agreement, but if you keep on refusing to see the reality of everyday life, which is that 15 of the 27 Member States are using the opt-out and that there are currently not enough workers in many professions to do the job, especially in the new Member States, then the opt-out simply has to continue being the reality of the day. Let us return to this issue in 10 years, when the situation in the Member States may be quite different. Let us create the conditions for Member States not to have to use the opt-out, and then we might be surprised at how quickly we reach a compromise.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate featured arguments that have been used many times before and for good reason. I think this is quite natural, as the debate has gone on for five years, and has affected us all, and I would like to thank everyone who played a serious part in it. However, the fact remains that we did not achieve a good result or a stable result, and we will probably have to respond to that. I would like to note how typical it was that the debate barely covered any topic beyond the opt-out and, perhaps to a rather limited extent, on-call time. It paid no attention to additional rest, for example, nor did it take account of changes within the framework of night work, among other things. Virtually all of the changes, which went far beyond the issues of on-call time and the opt-out, have, to a certain extent, fallen hostage to the two main issues. A directive was approved in 1993 which accepted the exception. This directive envisaged certain types of revision, but not a revision focused only on the opt-out so much as on the directive as a whole. In 2003, the European Court of Justice ruled that on-call time spent at the workplace counts as working hours. The ruling has its own logic and it is quite comprehensible to me. Since that point, the number of Member States using the opt-out has risen sharply. The reason for that is quite simple. In most Member States, working hours spent at the workplace were not treated as real work time, and as soon as they had to be counted as fixed working hours, the Member States began to opt out in order to comply with the directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, as I have already indicated, the situation is complex, and has its own inner dynamic. Virtually all of the possible routes forward have been explored during the five years of debates, which have been very far-reaching. I think that our debate has not yet ended, however, and that it is vital to keep seeking other solutions because the current situation is not satisfactory. There are several reasons why it is unsatisfactory and these reasons go beyond on-call time (which I myself regard as the most serious aspect) and beyond the opt-out, which is undoubtedly a substantial issue. The other reasons include night work, additional leave and a whole range of other issues, which can - and in my opinion gradually should - be explored to improve safety and the protection of health at work, since this particular directive deals with health and safety at work. The organisation of working time which is expressed through the directive includes this particular aspect and not only the universal aspect.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Sedláček, has told us that the Council accepted the proposal at the beginning of last week. I must state quite clearly that the information which we were given in the trialogue was quite different. We received the information that the Commission proposal would not be accepted, that there would be no possibility of an opt-out during the trial period and that the period of six months would not be accepted. It was also made clear that on-call time would not be regarded as a necessary continuation of working time. We were also told exactly what has been said here, that there was a willingness to toe the line. This was not the position of Parliament. I would like to make it clear that we did receive this information. The problem may be that you came later, not until after midnight, but we did receive this information.
Secondly, Mr Bushill-Matthews gave the impression that the negotiations were biased and one-sided. I would like to explain one thing. The negotiating delegation consisted of the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, the chairman of the Committee, the shadow rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda, from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself. We were in agreement on every single case. The guidelines in this House ensure that my group does not have the majority in the delegation to the Conciliation Committee. The results were quite clear: 15 votes in favour, none against and five abstentions. The debate today has quite clearly demonstrated that a broad majority of Parliament supports this position. I would not like anyone to go away with this impression of bias.
I am sorry that the legislative process aimed at amending the Working Time Directive has ended in failure. This highlights the absence of consensus between the Council and the European Parliament on one of the key work-related issues. The Council's rejection of the compromise solution, which was confirmed by two readings in the European Parliament and supported by groups right across the political spectrum on both the left and right, has come right at the time when across Europe there is an increasing number of jobs being lost, large companies are queuing up to announce their redundancy plans and ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money are being used to help banks which are in dire straits and to alleviate the damaging effects of the economic crisis.
Furthermore, the adverse consequence of the Council's stubborn insistence on the opt-out was that, as a result of the conciliation procedure conducted with the European Parliament ending in failure, they also failed to reach a successful resolution of the doctors' on-call time issue, even though the EU's legislators were already very close to agreement and to accepting a compromise solution. Reaching agreement on this issue would have been much more beneficial to each party concerned than continuing the legal wrangling. Although no one is disputing the substance of the European Court's judgments, it is still an odd situation when doctors have to continually take legal action against the upholders of the institutions to be able to exercise their rights.
rapporteur. - Madam President, firstly I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have been very willing to work with me on what is an incredibly technical and difficult dossier. By working together we have been able to come up with what I believe is a good compromise. I would also like to thank the Commission for their cooperation, and we look forward to working with them on this dossier in the future. I would also like to thank Patrick Baragiola from the AGRI secretariat and my adviser Dan Dalton.
Until we have alternatives in place, I believe that it would be unwise to outlaw these types of experiments, either directly or indirectly through poorly worded legislation. This directive will set out the framework to ensure that we can phase out animal testing as soon as alternative methods are available. It significantly improves the search for alternatives and puts us firmly on the path to one day phasing out animal testing altogether. We have a good compromise in the AGRI Committee. However, the Liberal group appears to be trying to drive a coach and horses through this agreement. I would urge them not to vote against this report, because it will set back animal welfare by several years and it would be completely wrong for them to take this action.
Numerous Member States have long since adopted their own national legislation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. As a result, there are different levels of protection in Europe. The review will achieve a harmonised level of protection within the Community and will safeguard the smooth operation of the internal market. The Commission's aim is to improve the legislation of the European Union governing animal experiments. On the one hand, this will both limit the number of experimental animals and, on the other hand, it will provide suitable care and treatment of animals subjected to experiments, as required under the Protocol on protection and welfare of animals added to the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Our aim is for this review to considerably improve the welfare of experimental animals within the European Union. The welfare requirements of animals are now officially included in the Treaty on European Union and must be taken into account when laying down policies in sectors such as the internal market. Experts and specialists in the animal testing sector, the research community, the industry directly interested and citizens were involved in formulating the proposal with transparent procedures and without exclusions. The proposal is also based on a carefully substantiated impact assessment. Moreover, numerous scientific agencies made a significant contribution to this procedure. A comparative analysis of the possible benefits and the costs of taking action against not taking action was carried out in order to draw up the proposal. This proposal strikes the necessary balance; on the one hand, it promotes competitiveness and research in Europe and, on the other hand, it takes full account of the welfare requirements of animals. The Commission has carefully examined the concerns expressed by various sides that the proposal would expel European research from Europe, due to the supposed administrative burden or the cost involved in specific animal welfare requirements. However, there is no evidence that there will be any such drain to non-EU countries. Several of the welfare standards contained in our proposal and many of the stricter licensing procedures are already being applied by Member States who lead the way in research globally. Furthermore, our proposal makes provision for measures to minimise the administrative burden. There is, in fact, no contradiction between the adoption of strict animal welfare standards and the promotion of a high level of scientific research. On the contrary, the two concepts are interconnected.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Animal Testing Directive is based on the 3Rs principle. Our objective is the replacement, reduction and refinement of animal testing. In order to achieve this, we need to develop and promote alternative methods. Thirdly, we must find a compromise between animal welfare and research, while placing the emphasis on human health. Commissioner, you have also emphasised that we need to have the same standards in all Member States.
The current legislative proposal is based on the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals and on the animal health strategy. We want to ensure a high level of protection and high standards in the European Union and throughout the world. However, the complete abolition of animal testing without other methods being available as an adequate replacement would make the majority of the research based on animal experimentation in the European Union almost impossible. Research projects would move abroad, we would lose the huge amount of knowledge that we currently have and we would make ourselves completely dependent on other countries. Therefore, it is important to find a compromise and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has presented a good compromise. Admittedly it is not an easy balancing act, but for people who are ill it may be a matter of survival.
The Commission was subjected to great pressure. I would like specifically to thank Commissioner Dimas. You have done some very good preparatory work and you have introduced important improvements in the welfare of laboratory animals, such as prior authorisation and follow-up checks for all tests. You have extended the directive to cover all animal species, not just mammals. The Commission has also effectively resolved the highly controversial issue of tests on non-human primates. These tests have been restricted to life-threatening illnesses and brain diseases.
However, it is a pity that Article 15 has not got through. Article 15 gives some Member States the option of retaining stricter standards, as is the case, for example, in the Netherlands. Why do we want to lower the standards which are currently very high in the Netherlands? Our joint aim must be to find a balance between high levels of animal welfare and intensive research. I have had enough of the knock-out argument, which is always trotted out, that research will move abroad. This is not necessarily always true.
This report sets out a possible balance between the contradiction of values and emotions with which we are faced, and it reveals an effort to compromise which can only ennoble this Parliament and its most committed Members. I therefore congratulate those with whom I dealt most in this discussion - the rapporteur, Neil Parish, and the shadow rapporteur of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Roselyne Lefrançois - on their excellent work and the consensus that they managed to achieve on such a difficult and controversial issue.
- (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned about the suffering of laboratory animals as well, but at the same time I know, as a physician, that we must do everything we can to make vaccines and medicines available to our patients as soon as possible, for the treatment of new and old diseases. I would like to thank our fellow Members, who have succeeded in finding a truly balanced compromise which respects and honours ethical principles applying to the treatment of animals while at the same time making it possible to carry on with research projects. First and foremost this directive sends a clear political signal that we want our scientists to look for alternative methods of verifying research into new medicines, in order to minimise the number of animals and the number of tests, while naturally complying with all of the possible ethical principles so as to avoid the suffering of animals. I would like to thank you all for this outcome.
Concern was also expressed about the criteria for severity bands. I am in a position to announce to you that, before the summer recess, the Commission will convene a working party of experts to examine the definition of appropriate criteria for use in the European Union. Without doubt, we will need to maintain the balance struck, as a result of detailed consultation with those directly involved, between the needs of industry and the promotion of research, on the one hand, and animal welfare, on the other. Consequently, the restrictions on the use of non-human primates must be retained, as must the principle of licensing and independent ethical evaluation of all forms of research, which are basic elements in this proposal. To recapitulate, the Commission is able to accept 83 of the 202 proposed amendments in full, in part or in principle. I shall send Parliament's secretariat a list with the Commission's detailed positions on the amendments.
Finally, I should like to say that, over and above this proposal, which is very important and for which we must maintain the balance between the needs of scientific research and improving human health, while at the same time using methods which are not hard on animals, I must say that the Commission, all the while I have been Commissioner, has taken numerous measures to protect animals. I would remind you of our previous debate on seals, of the very drastic measures and reaction in connection with whale hunting, of the issues relating to unsustainable hunting, especially in spring, and of the measures which we took for the first time as the Commission, with safety measures to prevent precisely such cases.
A lot of technical expertise and work has been put into this report. We do not deliver this report lightly. We have put serious work into it and we have good compromises. I have sought to bring all sides together to deliver a report which is right for Parliament, right for research and industry, and right for animal welfare. I would urge all to support it because, if we do not get it through, we face delaying the report for a couple of years, and this would be detrimental to the industry and to animal welfare. So I would urge all Members to support it.
If there are groups here that decide to vote against it, I think in the long run all it will do is delay what is a good proposal, one which will help to make sure there is research available in the European Union to help with disease control and new medicine while at the same time reducing the number of animals we need to use and actually strengthening ECVAM in looking for alternatives. So I would urge all Members to vote for it because we want a really resounding result in the morning.
However, whilst this remains the end goal, we are not yet in a position to end animal experimentation altogether. There remains a huge gap in the development of alternative, non-animal testing methods. Whilst this remains the case, it would be unwise and potentially disastrous for human health to mandate a date beyond which animal testing or testing on certain categories of animals, such as non-human primates, can no longer be carried out. Public opinion polls tend to support this approach and they cannot be ignored.
The reform is the fruit of negotiations with the Council, represented by the Czech presidency which, by the way, deserves my full praise, since it has had no shortage of political difficulties to face throughout its term of office; it is a combination of a structural reform of the directive, which does not affect the foundations of Parliament's mandate and which fully respects the principle of subsidiarity, since the directive establishes the principle of sanctioning actions in the terms defined by the Court of Justice ruling, while leaving Member States to define the types of penalties.
This will fill the legal vacuum created following the ruling by the Court of Justice annulling Framework Decision No 2005/667, which established the nature, type and level of criminal penalties for the illegal discharge of polluting substances at sea. Once adopted, the directive will make it possible to fight more effectively against those responsible for polluting the seas. The text that Parliament is about to adopt is, therefore, an important addition to the third maritime safety package signed by the presidents of both Parliament and the Council at the end of your last plenary session.
For this reason, the Commission supports the text, even if it does introduce separate treatment for minor infringements and repeated minor infringements. On the other hand, I can appreciate that the Council and Parliament have thought it desirable for discharges that do not lead to a deterioration in water quality to not necessarily be subject to criminal proceedings. Even more so than Parliament, I am keen to see small discharges criminally punished; although they may not be very serious, they can lead, precisely because they are repeated, to real pollution of the marine environment.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Mr President, the legal vacuum created by the relevant ruling of the European Court of Justice necessitated the amendment of the directive under debate. It is incredible that a legal-basis error has caused a delay in the implementation of such an important directive, and has without doubt been detrimental to our marine environment. Lessons can and must be learned by all concerned in order to avoid such occurrences in the future.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, marine pollution is only the focus of interest when there has been a dramatic accident. Then there are serious debates about the threats to our oceans from this ongoing pollution. Unfortunately, the subject is always largely ignored in the interim. We must take seriously the constant and repeated violations of the law which make just as significant and just as dramatic a contribution to the threat not only to our oceans but also to our coastlines.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the version of the amending directive, negotiated by the rapporteur with the Council, which introduces sanctions against ship-source pollution. We would like to congratulate him warmly on his work. We would also like to congratulate the Vice-President, because without the help of the Commission it would not have been possible to come to an agreement with the Council at the first reading. It is a big day for us, because we can complete this important dossier at the end of this period.
It is much cheaper to discharge something illegally into the sea. Surely that cannot be right. Therefore, we need effective sanctions. I would like to thank the rapporteur for this three-way agreement, which has been reached between all three institutions. It is clear that serious ship-source pollution must be classified and punished as a criminal offence and minor ship-source pollution can be regarded a regulatory offence, so that there is a distinction between the seriousness of the two types of activity. However - and my third point is very important - repeated minor ship-source pollution should now be regarded as a criminal offence, because it contributes to the overall pollution of the oceans and that is not a trivial matter.
However, it is important for us to tighten the current system of sanctions for illegal discharges from ships by supplementing the relevant legislation. We must emphasise that this legislation was necessary precisely because the existing preventive regulations were not enforced adequately. Unfortunately, the MARPOL 73/78 Convention was not enforced adequately either. This is why I believe that it is important for us to have this legislative package. I also believe the fact that opinions were given by both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Petitions highlights the importance of this subject.
A further message in the sensitive area of transport, and, since this will be one of the last debates to involve Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, I take this opportunity to thank all the members of that committee for the work they have done in cooperation with the European Commission and myself, to come up with practical solutions to several important matters, some of which had been dragging on for months. This was made possible thanks to the intelligence of Members of this House, and also to the work we have done to achieve efficient cooperation among our staff, showing that, when bureaucracy has clear-cut tasks, when there are goals to be reached, it is not a barrier for citizens but an effective instrument, alongside politics, with which to meet citizens' needs.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I shall speak very briefly, for which the honourable Members will be grateful at this time of night: Mr Tajani, many thanks once again because you have shown, as you did in the third maritime package, that your impetus and political skill have brought about an agreement with the Council and made it possible for Parliament, the Council and the Commission to come to an agreement on this occasion and in the final days of this parliamentary term.
During our deliberations, debate and consultations with stakeholders, we received numerous representations concerned about the lack of clarity and certainty in this proposal. We encouraged consumer organisations and business stakeholders to initiate their own dialogue on how we can make this proposal work, and I know that the Commissioner has received a jointly drafted letter from business and consumer organisations which has been copied to all MEPs. I would like to quote from that. They say, 'we attach great importance to the legal clarity and quality of the proposal, as well as to the need to know what consequences and changes it would bring about compared with the current situation. We believe there is a high degree of uncertainty about the scope and the consequences of this proposal in particular in relation to its impact on national legal orders.'
In short, we would like the Commission to take some time in the intervening election period before Parliament is reconstituted in July to undertake the following work (this is all contained in the Oral Question): an analysis of the practical and legal implications of the proposal on consumer rights in each Member State; a clarification of the relationship between the fully harmonised provisions in the directive and the general remedies available in national contract law; a clarification of the interplay of the draft proposal with existing Community legislation, in particular the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, E-Commerce Directive, Services Directive, the Rome I Regulation and, of course, the proposed CFR. We want some further evidence in the impact assessment to help us analyse and demonstrate the benefits and costs of this proposal and any alternative approaches that could be put forward.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank Arlene McCarthy very much for her words because a lot has really been done on this directive. I would, however, like this directive - which we will continue to work on - not just to be adopted, but also to be embraced, by all the stakeholders. We will not spare our efforts for this to happen. As this is our last session here, may I use the opportunity to thank you all very sincerely, especially Arlene as the chair of our committee, as well as Mr Harbour and especially Mrs Cederschiöld. I expect one way or another to keep in touch with you because it was a real pleasure to work with you and I hope this will continue in another way.
I would now like to concentrate on the next important steps for the directive because I do believe that this directive is very important for all of us. We need this directive for the internal market of the 21st century. Let me make it clear that, before tabling the proposal, the Commission carried out a comparative law analysis, the 'Compendium', covering the laws of the Member States transposing the consumer directives under revision. The Commission is now going through the various provisions of the proposal in more detail with the Member States in order to improve its understanding of the practical impact on national law.
Under the proposal, Member States will be able to retain general contract law remedies for faulty goods, provided that the legal requirements for the exercise of these remedies differ from the requirements which apply to the remedies regulated in the proposal. I appreciate that this interaction between the proposal and national general contract law remedies could be made clearer in the text. This means that remedies such as the right to reject in the UK or the garantie des vices cachés in France could be maintained. However, I am also prepared to consider alternatives whereby elements of these national remedies could be incorporated into the proposal, if such a solution were to be preferred by the Council and the Parliament.
The proposal complements the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCP). Whereas UCP protects consumers collectively against questionable business practices by rogue traders, the draft Consumer Rights Directive provides consumers who conclude a contract with a trader with individual contractual rights, which they can enforce before civil courts. As regards the Services Directive and the E-Commerce Directive, the information requirement in these Directives will apply in addition to those of the proposal and will also prevail in case of conflict with the proposal.
The proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights was preceded by a thorough impact assessment. The impact assessment also monetised the administrative burden that would accrue as a result of the changes proposed, and compared it with the cost of compliance that traders wishing to sell to other Member States have to incur as a result of the fragmentation of consumer protection rules and Rome I. The assessment showed that full harmonisation of the essential consumer rights would have strong positive effects on internal market integration and consumer confidence. During the initial stages of the legislative process, it appeared that further evidence and more insight might be useful on consumer behaviour and preferences regarding sales remedies. I intend to launch a qualitative study in the near future on this matter, with a view to gathering evidence following in-depth interviews with consumers and traders. The results of the study should be available in the third quarter of 2009.
Firstly, I hope that Mrs Kuneva will continue her work, and I hope that she can get a draft horizontal directive adopted. However, you will only achieve this if, firstly, you very precisely assess the impact on all national legislations, which has not been done; secondly, if you position this proposal very precisely in relation to existing and proposed regulations, directives and agreements at Community level, which has not been done; thirdly, if you very precisely stipulate that some rules of principle, such as on hidden defects, are safeguarded, which has not been done; and, fourthly, if you indicate - and this is the most important point - what level of protection will result from implementing the directive, and not just what the provisions will be.
I have room for three points that I think it is appropriate to mention. 1. A clearer scope for the directive. 2. At present, goods with an original defect can be returned within two years; this should be three years. 3. The withdrawal period should be set at one year, which will increase consumer protection in most Member States. Clear, unambiguous rules and a high level of consumer protection benefit both consumers and businesses. Unclear rules are detrimental to genuine businesses and to small and medium sized enterprises. The Council and Parliament should now incorporate these three central points into a fully harmonised proposal.
The Commission is now going through the various provisions of the proposal in more detail with the Member States, in order to improve understanding of the practical impact on national law, exactly as you, Mr Toubon, and Parliament asked. We will spare no effort to make everything clear. This is a legal text; this is a civil text; and how this legal text can even be translated is itself quite a challenge. We will therefore keep explaining and maintaining the good level of collaboration with the Council, and with Parliament, on this aspect.
Following the expansion of the EU it is all the more difficult and complex to be a consumer. A whole series of issues directly concern consumers, from the defect-free condition of products purchased, to confidence in transactions to on-line shopping and advertising. As many of these issues go beyond the boundaries of individual countries we need harmonised legislation and intensive efforts at prevention awareness, which will provide us with enough self-awareness to avoid becoming pawns in the hands of experienced companies. For this reason consumers should know how to use the portals providing them with up-to-date information, for example RAPEX on hazardous products, SOLVIT on the internal market, DOLCETA on financial awareness and many others. The European Consumer Centre and the Europa Diary can also help consumers considerably.
I must confess, Mr President, Commissioner, to a certain uneasiness, because, throughout this process we have always sought to reach an understanding but, nevertheless, there has been a certain amount of pressure for the report not to reach plenary and even now some comments suggest that Parliament's position will be disregarded as well. This is most surprising and, in addition, does not stem from Commissioners themselves but, rather, from certain high-ranking officials - very few, but from some high-ranking officials - convinced that they are permanent members of staff in contrast to Members of Parliament and even Commissioners who are, by definition, interim staff here on a short-term basis.
And then, from 2004 on, they have been covered by Article 90 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, which is why they are now called AICs. The age limit of 65 years is a rule of the Staff Regulations that covers all categories of personnel working for the institutions, be they officials, temporary, contract or auxiliary staff, as well as parliamentary assistants, following the recent adoption of a new regulation in this respect. This rule was applied to AICs by the Commission, as well as Parliament, between 2000 and 2004.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, as I missed one minute of time earlier, I would like to respond to Commissioner Kuneva, who is aware of the feeling of friendship and affection I have for her and, indeed, for Mr Orban. But the Commissioner has failed to make a single mention of the Ombudsman's recommendation. In other words, the Ombudsman, who is aware of all the Commissioner's arguments, has made a specific recommendation of which the Commission appears to be ignoring every aspect.
I am not even asking Mrs Kuneva to give me an answer personally because, obviously, she is not the one with the information, but all the information she has given me is in line with what we already knew and with what the Ombudsman knows and yet she still has not told us whether the Commission - regardless of all that and knowing that the Ombudsman, who is familiar with the case, is recommending that the rule be changed - is going to act on the Ombudsman's request and Parliament's related recommendation.
rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to welcome the European Commission's proposal to recast the directive on energy labelling with the basic objective of extending its scope to all appliances which consume electricity during domestic, commercial and industrial use and to energy-related products. This directive forms part of a broader package of legislative proposals which aim to promote energy efficiency, which is a matter of top priority for the Union, because it can play a decisive role in strengthening energy security, reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and reviving the European economy, so that it will be able to get out of the recession and the crisis more quickly.
I want to warmly thank all my fellow Members for their proposals, especially the shadow rapporteurs, the PSE secretariat and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy because, with their help, we have managed - I believe - to strengthen the directive on energy labelling. That is why we attach particular importance to the provisions relating to public procurement, that is why we attach particular importance to the adoption of incentives to promote the most efficient appliances and that is why we want to strengthen the provisions relating to market control and supervision.
I shall comment on just two issues which have caused serious confrontation. The first relates to our proposal that advertisements should include a reference to energy consumption, which caused disproportionate reactions from the Federation of European Publishers and from radio and television station owners. I say disproportionate, because extreme arguments were heard, such as that it restricts the freedom of the press, that advertising revenue was falling in the sensitive area of the mass media and, finally, that financing of a free and independent press is being undermined. Let us look at the facts of the matter, at what we are proposing in our report. We consider that advertisements for energy-related products should include a reference to energy consumption or to energy savings or to the category of energy label only if the advertisement includes references to technical specifications or technical information. Where the advertisement does not include any such reference, there is no obligation to refer to energy consumption.
I have left until last the question of the layout of the energy label, which proved to be the most burning issue in this directive. This directive will not have achieved its objective and will not be effective if the energy label cannot be easily recognised and compared by the consumers at whom it is primarily directed, in order to help them make the best possible choices. Today we have a successful energy labelling model on a scale from A to G, where Α is used for the most efficient products and G for the least efficient, a scale which is used today as a standard in many countries outside the European Union. It is undoubtedly very successful and recognisable and has made a huge contribution towards energy savings. It certainly also has numerous problems. The most serious of these problems, the basic reason for these problems, is that the label is not accompanied by an indication of its period of validity. Where there is no indication of the period of validity of the label, when a product is classified in category Α and stays in that category for life, even when more energy efficient products have been launched, it is clear that we are sending out mixed messages. So how can we address this? By introducing an obligation for labels to have a specific period of validity, for example 3 to 5 years and, once this period has expired, for the energy efficiency scale to be revised on the basis of progress achieved in the specific category of product.
The report will definitely add some very significant improvements, welcomed by the Commission, to the initial proposal. The rapporteur is right to highlight two issues that will be the cornerstone of future debates between the Council and Parliament. The first is the issue of advertising and how far we can go to promote energy-efficient product selling practices without hampering the role of civil liberties or freedom of the press, and the second is the issue of the layout of the label - whether it should be a closed label or an open-ended scale label.
There are, however, two points that I must strongly oppose. First, I would like to warn that, if adopted, Amendment 32 would hamper the independence of the media. It must be stressed that advertising is key for free, independent, diverse and high-quality media. Our group has therefore come up with an alternative amendment - Amendment 2 tabled for the plenary - respecting the importance of free and diverse media for democracy. Our solution is to give producers and retailers the possibility of providing information on specific energy-consumption-saving aspects.
In addition, I think that it is important to have this A-G scale, which is simple. However, I would like to mention that I believe it is important for the period of validity to be specified so that the consumer has information even from the time when certain products are advertised. I do not believe that the obligation to provide information about energy consumption will interfere in any way with the freedom of expression and the provisions concerning the mass media. I think that it is in all our interests to have well-informed consumers who can make an enlightened decision to reduce their energy consumption.
It is important that the consumer can always have confidence that equipment in Category A absolutely always reflects the best technology - the most energy-efficient technology - there is on the market. The EU energy label has been a success. It has rid the market of energy-wasting equipment, and that model has been followed in such countries as Brazil, China, Argentina, Iran, Israel and South Africa. It is very unfortunate that the manufacturers of equipment now want to make this successful and clear system of labelling an unclear category, and that the Commission is inclined to support this.
However, we should consider things carefully and I would also like to take seriously the reservations which the Commission has put forward. If we do what the majority in the committee here in Parliament have suggested, namely to simply keep A-G, I fear that old appliances will continue to be categorised as A, while new more energy-efficient appliances will only be classified as B. We will therefore either have a transition period for re-labelling - which will lead to confusion - or we will have constant change, constant new labelling.
I have followed labelling legislation for the last 15 years. What is in the labelling directive from the beginning of the 1990s? It states that A to G should be regularly updated in line with the state of the art, so that only the best are in the A category. What has industry done? It obstructed the updating at the end of the 1990s. Consequently, at the beginning of 2000 more than 50% of all appliances were in category A. Then they came up with the gimmick of A+ and A++. Now they have come up with the gimmick of A-20, A-40 and A-60.
(CS) Madam President, I have spoken here a number of times on energy issues, and this may be my concluding comment during this term. I think it is appropriate at this point to express thanks to Commissioner Piebalgs, who had a very difficult task, because making a European energy market out of the 27 separate markets of the individual Member States is a remarkable undertaking, it is a labour of Sisyphus which will not end with this term, and there will certainly be many tasks remaining for our successors. I would like to say that for us in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, he was one of the most popular Commissioners: those Commissioners from whom we learned a great deal, and whose level of enthusiasm we admired. I hope we have not been too demanding on the Commissioner, because I think we will certainly be meeting him during future Parliamentary terms, and Mr Piebalgs has really worked very hard to make it possible even to speak of a European energy market. I support energy labelling, it is a necessary standard, and I think reproaches about who belongs or does not belong to a particular industrial lobby should be set aside. Likewise, I think it is unfortunate if this Parliament has in the past months become a place for scaremongering. We need decisions based on facts.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is difficult. I thank Mr Ransdorf for his very kind words, but I think it is wrong to accuse somebody - industry, lobby or not - because industry provides jobs and creates growth. Industry is also looking for more energy-efficient appliances to produce and place on the market. At the same time, 'A to G' is well known to consumers. There is a strong need to consolidate the experience of 'A to G' and involve industry, not by force, but by really involving them. That is what the Commission is trying to do.
The second was about the eco-design measure for fridges and TV sets. It is not a perfect solution, but at least it is a solution that brings these two products into the labelling scheme, because today we do not have any labelling on TVs, while the situation concerning fridges is confusing: every fridge is in a category. We have therefore proposed and agreed to this measure as a temporary measure until we have framework directives that establish clear rules. It is not because we have been bound by industry, but it was the best way to consolidate both approaches.
The report does not at this stage give a complete solution. There are differences of opinion, but we are on the way, and, as always, the most complicated legislation is adopted in compromises and consensus. We will need to continue to work, but not to label somebody that is fighting against energy efficiency, because labelling is the easiest way to bring about our goals for energy efficiency. People make informed choices about their appliances in a way that corresponds to the global society's interest. This is the best way, and we should promote it.
I should like to make two very brief comments. First of all, as regards the burning issue of energy labelling. I would like to point out that the A to G scale, which we all consider to be very successful and recognisable and to have made a huge contribution towards energy savings, obviously has problems which, Mr Reul, I listed in my opening comments; in other words, this scale needs to be updated. The basic problem with the existing energy label is that it has no period of validity, resulting in the situation which you described, namely that we have energy products on the market with the same label and different levels of energy efficiency. The crucial issue is for us to introduce a specific period of validity for A to G energy labelling and for us to update energy efficiency indicators every 3 to 5 years on the basis of progress made on the market.
Finally, I consider that the conclusion which we need to draw is simple. We have - and we all recognise that we have - a tested and successful recipe for energy labelling which has also become a standard for other countries outside the European Union. When you have a successful recipe which has become outdated over the years, you do not abolish it, you update it because, if you abolish it and you do not replace it with a new system, you risk losing the added value which you generated in previous years by opting for energy labelling. Europe's message to consumers over all these years has been: choose energy label Α. We alone must not weaken this message.
We all want to work together to refine, reduce and replace animal testing. However, we must remember that many vaccines and cures for diseases have been developed using animals, and especially primates - for example, vaccines for polio, diphtheria, hepatitis B, along with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. All are examples of the benefits of animal research. To allay concerns that many Members have with the use of embryonic stem cells, Amendment 170, if supported, will ensure that ethical decisions on this issue are made by Member States themselves and not by the Commission.
Firstly the communication identifies how good governance in the tax area could be improved within the European Union so as to reinforce the argument for other jurisdictions to follow. It calls on Member States to swiftly adopt Commission proposals for directives on administrative cooperation and mutual assistance in the recovery of taxes and savings taxation. Member States should also continue to give appropriate priority to eliminating harmful business tax regimes. More specifically, the Commission's proposal on administrative cooperation contains a provision according to which bank secrecy could no longer be invoked to deny a request for information from another Member State relating to persons non-resident in the requested Member State. This is entirely in line with international consensus on tax information exchange.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, the Commission is fully committed to helping to protect people from earthquakes. This protection must form part of an integrated approach to dealing with situations which may be caused by various dangers. The Commission recently adopted a communication entitled 'A Community approach on the prevention of natural and manmade disasters' which also covers earthquakes. This communication follows on from the actions taken by the Commission over recent years, which are in line with many of the recommendations formulated by the European Parliament in its resolution in 2007. This specific action relates in particular to the dissemination of best practices, the development of joint approaches to risk evaluation, mapping and education and awareness-raising, while at the same time seeking to improve the cohesion of and synergies between financial and legislative means of prevention which already exist, thereby strengthening the added value of action by the European Union. The Commission will make every possible effort to moderate the impact of earthquakes by encouraging the Member States to fully integrate the common European planning codes for buildings and public works, especially Eurocode 8, into their national regulations. The Commission awaits the response of the European Parliament to the approach proposed in its communication with particular interest.
(EL) Madam President, I am sorry, but the question remains. I honestly do not understand: why does the Commission refuse to do for earthquakes what it did for floods? What is the difference? In fact, I am very surprised that this debate is being held after the recent disaster in Italy. As regards the last communication to which you referred, it mentions earthquakes in passing at three points, to which you referred. Do you honestly believe that a reference to earthquakes at three points in a communication suffices to counterbalance the huge need which we have in Europe for a communication specifically on earthquakes? I would honestly like to have an answer.
As such, it is addressed at the Member States, which jealously guard the principle of subsidiarity as regards competence for this matter, so that they will incorporate the provisions of the European Union on buildings into their national laws, be they the provisions of Eurocode 8 for new buildings, or the provisions on strengthening buildings for old buildings. Let them do so, let them take certain other actions which are needed, such as strict compliance with planning regulations, in order to prevent most of the disasters.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, connected to the fault line through the Apennines, there is another fault line which crosses Slovenia. As you perhaps know, the Krško nuclear power plant is situated on this fault line. On our initiative several warning devices have been installed there. What measures do you plan to take, following this devastating earthquake in Italy, to guarantee the security of the Krško nuclear power plant, which stands on a fault line connected to this. Do you think that you might take precautionary measures, which might go so far as closing Krško?
(EL) Madam President, I too am surprised by the position expressed by the Commission here today because, of course, we respect the reply as regards the question of subsidiarity and I absolutely agree with the specific demands, but that does not resolve the question of a collective political proposal on the part of the European Commission which includes all aspects of disasters caused by earthquakes. Mr Pirker added yet another and, of course, we shall find others. The question therefore remains: why, over and beyond the principle of subsidiarity and the specific measures mentioned by the Commissioner, do we not have a global proposal on the part of the European Commission?
If there should be some delays, or if some projects are not sufficiently prepared, we will have a report in March 2010. So, if there is a possibility that part of the money is available, I promised at trialogues that the Commission will consider, if appropriate, making a necessary proposal. But it is premature to promise it because it depends how well we can commit the money, as today there are a limited number of projects where we believe that they have advanced enough to use this money.
Basically, nuclear energy is established in a way that means that each country has a nuclear safety regulator who has full responsibility for implementing nuclear safety measures. At the same time, each Member State decides whether or not to use nuclear energy. This is subject to the Euratom Treaty, and very clearly there are additional requirements. The additional requirements are that each project that is submitted is also analysed by the Commission and we make a recommendation on the projects to be developed. We did that in the case of Belene and also of Mochovce.
At the same time, because of the sensitivity of the issue - politically and also, sometimes, culturally - I strongly doubt that the European regulator could play the role required. I would not say the European regulator could not be trusted, but that regulator needs to keep a distance from nuclear power installations. I believe that full responsibility for safety should lie at all times with a national regulator, because that is the best way and that will always avoid the debate of whether the central regulator is pushing hard enough for nuclear energy etc.
In 2008 we supported the initiative from cities to have a Covenant of Mayors. This means that cities make a binding obligation to reduce CO2 by more than 20% by 2020. They develop sustainable energy action plans for this. They have also founded a Covenant of Mayors' Office for coordination and promotion. We support these actions through the Joint Research Centre, to provide scientific background and technical support for the preparation, implementation and evaluation of the sustainable energy action plans. For smaller municipalities, the Commission negotiates with other national, regional and local administrations to ensure their support for the smaller cities.
Thank you to Commissioner Piebalgs for his response. Commissioner, you have already pointed out in your response that there is a saving in economic terms because of the efficiency in energy, but now we need to move on to the next step. Rather than just promoting sustainability and energy efficiency, we need to utilise the funds to create new ways of creating energy to make cities even more self-sufficient, rather than importing fuel or building nuclear power stations, as we were saying previously. We need to find cleverer and better ways, and maybe you might look in the future not just to the investment bank but to new ideas coming from the Commission as well.
Member of the Commission. - Reports by the WTO and the Commission's own monitoring show that there is no imminent risk of a generalised protectionist escalation. None of the large trading nations has yet resorted to across-the-board restrictions on trade and investment. Developments in certain countries - for instance, Russia, Indonesia and Argentina - need close monitoring as these countries have until now been the greatest users of border measures to restrict trade. Overall, the most targeted sectors are agriculture and food products, iron and steel, metal, automobiles, textiles and toys.
Canada has one of the world's highest levels of Internet piracy. This is exacerbated by serious legislative and enforcement deficiencies. In fact, Canada's Copyright Act is in urgent need of revision in order to bring it into line with current international standards of protection in the on-line environment, such as those laid down in the WIPO Internet Treaties of 1996 and the EU Copyright Directive (2001/29/EC). The longer this situation lasts, the longer European rights holders - in particular the creative sector (authors, composers, performers, songwriters and phonogram producers) - will be deprived of the legal tools they need to stop the large-scale online infringement of their rights in Canada. Their losses to Internet piracy are huge. The situation is such that legislative action needs to be taken now rather than after the upcoming EU-Canada Trade Summit in May and subsequent bilateral trade negotiations.
The Commission's concerns have been put forcefully to the Canadian authorities for quite some time now. The fact we will soon start negotiations for a free trade agreement with Canada will give us a new opportunity to bring about significant improvement of IPR protection in Canada. In the mean time, the Commission will be taking the matter up with the Canadian authorities at the highest level. It will also call for the revision of Canadian copyright law to be initiated as soon as possible and preferably during the Parliament's present session.
The free trade agreement with Korea would create new market access in many areas of interest to EU exporters. By way of illustration: the agreement would swiftly eliminate EUR 1.6 billion of customs duties to the benefit of EU exporters; it would offer solid disciplines on non-tariff barriers in priority sectors such as the automotive, pharmaceutical, or consumer electrics sectors; it would provide significant new market access in services of special interest to EU service providers; it would offer the most ambitious package yet on intellectual property rights, government procurement, sustainable development and other rules issues; and it would foresee novel ways of involving civil society in the monitoring of how the free trade agreement is implemented, and protect our sensitivities with appropriate arrangements.
(EL) Madam President, in the absence of the competent Commissioner, Mrs Ashton, I should like to thank Commissioner Kuneva for her reply and to ask the Commissioner to convey my thanks to Mrs Ashton for mediating and consulting with the American side on the lifting of the carousel retaliatory measures being taken by the United States of America. This is an action which, if nothing else, goes one step further, goes beyond the limits of the partnership between the United States of America and the European Union, which are two principal commercial players which also play a leading role in the framework of negotiations under the Doha round under the aegis of the World Trade Organization.
Under the terms of Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on passenger rights in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, Member States are responsible for applying the regulation and are obliged to prosecute airlines that do not comply with the provisions. When processing passenger claims that are sent to them, the competent national authorities, appointed by Member States in accordance with the regulation, must evidently take into account the instructions provided by the Court of Justice. The Commission's role is that of monitoring the correct implementation of the regulation by the competent authorities, particularly in the light of relevant Court of Justice rulings.
We have currently started a consultation process with the EU Member States in order to renew the mandate of the European coordinators and thus cover the period 2009-2013. In this way, we will be able to allow them to carry on with their work, particularly that of monitoring the priority projects. On 22 March 2009, the Austrian authorities submitted their multiannual programme for infrastructures, which includes financing of the Brenner base tunnel. On 17 April 2009, following the completion of the environmental impact assessment, they issued a construction permit for the project.
Priority project 17 - the Strasbourg-Vienna high-speed link that forms part of the Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava rail axis - is proceeding in a satisfactory manner in all the Member States involved: France, Germany, Austria and Slovakia. Most of the 831 km stretch between Strasbourg and Vienna - more specifically the Strasbourg-Stuttgart and Linz-Vienna sections - will be complete by 2015. The Stuttgart-Ulm section, which represents the most significant bottleneck, will be complete by 2020.
The relevant finance protocol will be signed on 2 April of this year. At the moment, the most complicated section seems to be the cross-border section in Bavaria between Munich and Salzburg. The German Government is currently conducting a review of its multiannual programming, and so we will have to wait until the end of this year before we can begin discussing this very important section. The Strasbourg-Vienna section will cost EUR 10 billion and the priority project will cost EUR 13.5 billion in total.
I wanted to give you some other news because you are particularly interested in the Strasburg-Vienna section. On 31 March, the European Commission published two invitations to submit TEN-T proposals. Within the framework of these proposals, the Strasburg-Vienna section could obtain backing under the 2009 annual programme - amounting to EUR 140 million for both studies and work projects - and the European Economic Recovery Plan, this provides EUR 500 million exclusively earmarked for work projects to be started by the end of 2010 at the latest.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, following the local elections on 29 March, in which the Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) achieved a sensational victory - almost doubling their number of mayors from 52 to 98 - it is clear that the Kurdish question can no longer be reduced to a socioeconomic issue, as Mr Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) have been doing up to now. There is a clear need for a political solution, and the DTP must also be accepted as a full partner in discussions.
In this situation, one would think that a repressive approach was outmoded, yet the Turkish authorities have once again embarked on a widespread wave of arrests. More than 400 leading DTP personnel have been arrested for requesting a solution to the Kurdish question. My question to the Commission is as follows, therefore. This is now the fifth or sixth party set up by the Kurds - currently bearing the name DTP. It has 21 members of parliament and 98 mayors, and still the Kurds continue to be sidelined.
Today the mood has changed somewhat. We are growing increasingly concerned about the progress of the democratisation process in Turkey. Freedom of the press, the protection of minorities, but also reform of the judiciary must be monitored constantly. As for the Ergenekon trial which is taking place in Turkey, I would like to say that this must not become politicised. The fact is that arrests and searches are taking place. Hasty comments should be avoided. Careful reporting has an important role to play here.
Important progress has been made on the Kurdish question. The solution of the Kurdish problem is central to the process of democratisation and the protection of minorities. However, I also have concerns about the current position of some EU heads of government. Ambiguous signals from the EU also mean that from time to time the democratic process in Turkey faces a bumpy ride. In this respect I would like to recall that a clear commitment on behalf of the EU to Turkey's full membership would give the reform process a huge boost. Otherwise, there will always be new breeding grounds for fundamentalism and nationalism, and the Kurdish problem will get worse.
For the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe the problems of freedom of the press and of opinion are particularly important in this context. You know that you cannot watch YouTube in Turkey. The rights of journalists, publishers, publicists, columnists and authors are restricted by certain legal regulations. The Commission has thankfully indicated in its progress report that this is a problem. In the opinion of many observers, these problems have increased. I would be grateful if the Commission would say something about this - whether it believes the problems have got worse or whether things have got better. That would be really surprising.
In addition, there are important subjects like the protection of religious minorities and the safeguarding of women's rights. However, the key issue at the moment is the question of freedom of the press, the revoking of the press accreditations of critical journalists by the Prime Minister, the largely unjustified arrests of critical journalists and publishers in the course of investigations into the clearly criminal Ergenekon network, the takeover of the ATV-Sabah media group by the Scharlach-Holding, which is owned or controlled by the Prime Minister's son-in-law, the Prime Minister's public calls to boycott media and the judgement against the Doğan media group and fine of EUR 380 million with the aim of forcing it out of business because it reported the lighthouse donation scandal, and his preferential treatment of the AKP. This is not only a question of press freedom, it also scares off investors, who doubt the certainty of the law in Turkey.
It is progress that there were no riots on 1 May on Taksim Square in Istanbul, only trade union leaders commemorating the 1977 tragedy. It is progress that Turkey and Armenia have agreed to improve mutual relations. My call to the Turkish Government would be to continue on this path and not let itself be stopped or sidetracked by nationalists in Ankara or Baku. It is progress that there have been arrests of people suspected of planning a coup or of involvement in political assassinations: the Ergenekon affair.
Then there are the negative developments, however. It is a bad thing that the prime minister has called on the population to stop buying certain newspapers. It is a very bad thing that many of the leading members of a party that was democratically elected to the Turkish Parliament have been arrested. The mass arrest of prominent members of the Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) is just as unacceptable as a formal ban on the party, as the result is the same. The scope for finding a political solution to the Kurdish issue has been drastically curtailed. This is very good news for the extremists on both sides, but very bad news for the majority of Turks and Kurds, who have been longing for a peaceful solution to this problem for so long.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a 14-year-old boy in Hakkari was beaten into a coma by a SWAT team policeman. Another 14 year old, who was fleeing a police gas attack, drowned after falling into a river. On 4 April two people died at a demonstration near Urfa as a consequence of a police operation. At present in Diyarbakir there are more than 185 minors in prison. Hundreds of democratically elected politicians and activists of the DTP have been imprisoned, including three party leaders. There are more than 207 proceedings against DTP MPs.
Unfortunately, I do not think that even the highly praised AKP has either the will or the determination to develop and push through a comprehensive strategy for the resolution of this conflict, which has lasted for decades. As you all know, since the last progress report there has been no significant progress in the area of freedom of the press and of expression, recognition of the Kurdish reality, rights for religious minorities or civilising the military. The ruling AKP must finally implement genuine constitutional reform and bring a new dynamism, which can regenerate the country constitutionally and democratically and accept its pluralistic, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural social reality. Otherwise there can be no real democratisation in Turkey. That should be clear to all of us here.
Nowadays, this historical legacy - or rather burden - manifests itself in a veritable cultural battle between the secular Kemalist camp and the conservative/religious front surrounding the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) as to the direction the Republic of Turkey should be taking. A noxious consequence of this is the sensational Ergenekon trial of numerous prominent Kemalists. When it comes to nationalistic attitudes towards the country's religious and ethnic minorities, there is now precious little to choose between the Kemalists and Prime Minister Erdoğan. The constant disenfranchisement of these minorities - which is part of the history of the Republic of Turkey - is, of course, at variance with the EU's political conditions for accession.
We have seen and we have heard of 15 000 minors in prisons, we have heard of hundreds of arrests on dubious charges, we are aware that the Kurdish problem is still continuing and above all the Armenian problem, the ageold problem that is absolutely still alive to this day. We have seen the murders of priests or missionaries in the past two years, we have infinite problems. If we compare this situation to that of another country, let us say Belarus, which is still is considered a pariah country in Europe, a country that apparently actually forms part of an axis of evil, it is hard to understand how we can continue to talk about Turkey joining Europe.
I believe that Europeans are looking into their consciences and increasingly realising the inevitability of a decision against Turkey's admission into Europe. I will remind you of some facts: Turkey has 90 million inhabitants, strong demographic growth and above all we must not forget the fact that the Turkish speaking countries of Central Asia are demanding Turkish citizenship and the Turkish State seems intent on giving it to them. This means that the entrance of Turkey would not mean simply Turkey joining Europe but also other peoples, other states in Europe. Let us also not forget that, in historical terms, Turkey was against Europe and now it acts as a significant look-out for two powers that are certainly not European, in other words the United States and Israel.
We acknowledge that the DTP is an essential tool for fostering democracy in Turkey, and for this reason we firmly condemn the police operations that Prime Minister Erdoğan has ordered against you, imprisoning all three vice presidents of the DTP together with more than 300 militants and sympathisers. The DTP's victory in the last administrative elections shows that the DTP is a party that enjoys strong popular democratic support. The European Parliament resolved to ask Prime Minister Erdoğan to table direct discussions with the DTP and instead his response was more oppression, more police, more authoritarianism and more imprisonment.
I would like to send a very strong political message to Mr Erdoğan: either seek a negotiated political solution to the Kurdish question which, let us be very clear about this, is a process that will involve direct negotiations with the DTP, or we will ask you to suspend your negotiations for membership of the European Union. The road to Turkey's membership of the Union is via Diyarkabir and the DTP, otherwise it will be us, in other words the people who most supported your accession process, who ask for a pause for reflection, which could well become permanent.
Basically, Turkey is still a long way from respecting the values of the European nations, as demonstrated by the situation of the countless ethnic and religious minorities which make up the country. The situation of millions of Kurds is slow to improve. Relations with the Armenians or even their Greek neighbours are under constant diplomatic or military pressure. Cyprus is still under Turkish military occupation, in defiance of international law. This has gone on for 35 years. Religious minorities scarcely fare better. The rights of the communities not listed in the treaties are regularly trampled on, under the blind eye of the European Commission, which continues, as does Parliament, to support the accession of this country to the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to respond to what Mr Lagendijk has said. We too of course see the positive diplomatic role Turkey can play in relation to Armenia and in relation to the Middle East. However, diplomacy and democracy are two different things. We are particularly concerned by Prime Minister Erdoğan's action against Ahmed Doğan's publishing group. Even Der Spiegel, which has nothing to do with either Doğan or Springer, writes of Erdoğan's private vendetta against Doğan.
I have already mentioned the Commission's progress report. Once again I would like to ask the Commission a specific question. Is the Commission more or less concerned about freedom of opinion and of the press in Turkey than it was at the time the progress report was published? If no, why is it no longer concerned? If yes, what specific measures does the Commission intend to take? How important is the subject of freedom of the press and of opinion in relation to the ongoing accession negotiations? As I said, this is after all about the first Copenhagen criterion, the political criterion.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I want to thank honourable Members, first of all, for a very serious and substantive debate on the democratic process in Turkey, and I also want this evening to thank the European Parliament for its contribution to the EU's policy in relation to Turkey. There has been critical but constructive support for our engagement with Turkey in a very critical period. I think Parliament's approach - like, I trust, the Commission's approach - can be described as fair and firm in relation to Turkey and its EU accession process.
Indeed, in my view, we have to be fair and firm and only by being both at the same time can we achieve results. What I mean is that we have to be fair in the sense of maintaining the EU perspective as the critical driver of reforms in the country, keeping our word concerning Turkey's chance to show that it will be able to meet EU accession criteria. At the same time, we have to be firm by applying rigorous conditionality, especially as regards fundamental freedoms and democratic principles. These two key elements - fairness and firmness - only work together and they cannot be separated from each other. I think that is clearly the best way of supporting a democratic transformation in Turkey, which is our objective, because it makes Turkey a better partner and a prospective possible Member State of the European Union, in line with the negotiating framework adopted in the early hours of 4 October 2005.
So, the pace of negotiations with Turkey will essentially depend on the progress and intensity of the reforms enhancing fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in the country, in all walks of life and all corners of the country. That is the foundation of the negotiation process. Progress in the technical negotiations will depend on whether there is serious progress in, and intensity and implementation of, these reforms enhancing fundamental freedoms and human rights and democratic secularism. These are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in our common European values. That is the critical yardstick of Turkish progress towards the European Union.
Mr President, our civilisation is a civilisation which uses animals. We kill billions of animals for meat, for skins and for a variety of economic needs. Sometimes we also kill them where there is no economic reason - for sport, such as hunting, or for entertainment, such as in bullfighting. For me killing animals is neither sport, nor entertainment, nor culture, but we will not go into that here, because the subject of our debate is the killing of animals for economic reasons.
Protection of animals at the time of killing. Is it possible? Is it possible to protect an animal which we are going to kill? Yes, it is possible, mainly by sparing it unnecessary suffering. By protecting animals from inhuman treatment we protect our own humanity. The proposed regulation improves standards of protecting animals at the time of killing, and introduces higher, better technical norms and fosters better monitoring of their use. It introduces greater personal responsibility for the proper handling of animals, and also introduces a requirement to appoint a special officer responsible for animal protection in facilities which carry out slaughter. The new regulation, in place of the old 1993 directive, means obvious progress in realisation of the idea of animal protection, and therefore as rapporteur I endorse the regulation.
There were several areas of controversy. A conspicuous example is the question of ritual slaughter. The basic principle is to kill animals after they have been stunned and rendered unconscious, but an exception is allowed for religious reasons - killing without prior stunning, if this is required for religious reasons. This concerns adherents of Islam and Judaism, who kill animals without stunning them first. Amendments which were aimed at introducing a comprehensive ban on ritual slaughter in the European Union have been rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The Committee members were of the opinion that such a ban would be unworkable.
Ladies and gentlemen, the last sitting of the European Parliament is largely devoted to the protection of animals. Today we have resolved to ban the import of products from seals which have been killed with cruelty, we have resolved to impose higher standards for the protection of experimental animals, and now we are debating higher standards of animal protection at the time of killing. I am glad that Parliament is doing so much for animal protection, and I am glad that I can be part of it. The spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi is present in this Chamber. May he also be present in the next parliamentary term.
I would now like to say a few words on the practice of backyard slaughter. Today, the slaughter of animals for private consumption is permitted outside slaughterhouses (except cattle), but pigs, sheep and goats must have previously been stunned. Some citizens in the Member States traditionally slaughter pigs for Christmas and lambs for Easter. The preservation of these traditions is important to the Commission but there is no need to derogate from the stunning of animals, thereby undermining the welfare of the animals. Therefore the Commission believes that prior stunning should always be performed when pigs or lambs are slaughtered outside slaughterhouses.
Another point of the proposal is related to the establishment of a national centre of reference. We believe that this element is essential to guarantee proper enforcement of the proposed measures. In slaughterhouses, official inspectors perform food safety controls, mainly on carcasses. They have little time and limited competences to assess animal welfare parameters. These days, stunning equipment is complex and difficult to evaluate in relation to their welfare efficiency. National reference centres would meet the need for technical and scientific information on the welfare of animals at slaughter and the Commission considers that this requirement should be maintained in the proposal.
Animals are also killed in huge numbers outside slaughterhouses in order to control the spread of disease. It is true that requirements already exist for animal health purposes, but today's requirements do not relate to animal welfare. People consider that mass culling for disease-control purposes should be performed in the most humane way possible. Transparency, which means proper reporting, is therefore essential. Furthermore, previous experience in these emergency situations has shown that it is crucial to collect information on good practices and on mistakes that might have occurred. Proper monitoring and reporting on animal welfare should therefore be required in cases of mass culling.
However, this regulation is not really about that, but about how we can reduce the suffering of animals at slaughterhouses. The Commission's proposal is a step forward, but it must be made more stringent on a number of points. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety we voted through my opinion, in which we demand, among other things, shorter transport times and waiting times at slaughterhouses, investments in mobile slaughterhouses, that fur-bearing animals be included under this regulation, that Member States be able to go further and have more stringent provisions and that animal welfare inspectors and the proposed national reference centres for animal welfare be independent and be given greater powers.
It is gratifying that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports our proposal on mobile slaughterhouses and to include fur-bearing animals. However, I am deeply concerned about several other amendments put forward by this committee and by individual Members. It is unfortunate that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has completely deleted the proposed time limits for transport to the slaughterhouse and the waiting time inside the slaughterhouse. Please vote in favour of Amendment 125 put forward by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left so that we regain these requirements. I also do not understand why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wants to delete the proposal on national reference centres for animal welfare. It is also incredibly important to allow Member States to go further and have more ambitious provisions than those laid down here. I urge you to vote in favour of Amendment 124. Finally, I am deeply concerned about the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does not want to allow the Member States which currently have a complete ban on slaughter without stunning to retain that ban. This is the case, for example, in my country, Sweden. We have found a balance between religious tradition and animal welfare that most people are happy with. Please vote against Amendment 28, as proposed by the rapporteur.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by happy coincidence it falls on me to speak this evening for the last time, at least during this term, under your presidency, which I believe is your final presidency, because you have decided not to stand for re-election. I am delighted to express my satisfaction, Mr Cocilovo, for what you have done in this Parliament and for the esteem in which you are held by all the MEPs and not merely by the Italian delegation. I was elected to the same constituency as you; we are political opponents, but I feel as if I owe it to you to wish you a profitable political future acting in the interests of our country, but also of Europe.
Now I will get to the point. I believe that we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have done an excellent job. After listening to consultants and after listening to different professional groups, we have tried to improve on the text that was given to us by the Council and the Commission, making it more applicable and more consistent, safeguarding what amounts to the expression of and the right to religious practices, in all their facets. There were some contradictions, because the Commission and the Council stated and asserted that they would safeguard ritual butchery, but certain obligations made it impossible in practice - I refer to hanging upside down and the much debated topic of stunning.
The Charter of Human Rights states that whenever there is a conflict with animal rights, human rights take precedence, in other words the right to religious practices, and not only Muslim, not only Jewish but also Christian practices - as we have discussed at length in the committee - should be protected and protected to the full. Not least because, since we have reciprocal relations with non-member countries, people who practice certain types of religions could otherwise not eat meat in Europe because it cannot be produced in Europe and cannot be imported. I do not believe this is fair.
Finally, Commissioner, I would like you to bear in mind that in the European Union no two legal systems in the different regions and countries are the same; each one is different. The national reference centres you are proposing and to which you have just referred in your speech, were they to be implemented as the Commission suggests in its proposal, would entail the creation of 17 national reference centres in Spain, and not just one national reference centre. In Spain central government powers are decentralised to the autonomous communities and we would therefore be forced to establish 17 of these national centres you believe to be possible. That would be ridiculous: one centre for every region. That is why we propose that the relevant authority be responsible for ensuring the rules are correctly applied.
These questions are in large measure answered by the report, which still does not resolve many fundamental problems connected, for example, with legislation, ritual slaughter and forming the conscience of society. These problems, therefore, remain to be resolved by the Council, the Commission and by the new Parliament. I hope that further work on improving the welfare of animals will be accompanied by the realisation that animals are living beings, which can feel pain and suffering; that they are not things, and that people owe them respect, protection and care.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to add my own congratulations to our rapporteur, Janusz Wojciechowski, for tackling a very complex and emotional dossier with some aplomb and dealing with a lot of conflicting viewpoints. In this speech, which is probably my last speech in this mandate, it is worth remarking to colleagues that this is what I call a classic European Parliament European dossier. It is technical, it is complex, it is a little bit distant from our citizens, but it is worth remembering that animal welfare is of crucial importance to our citizens, and fairness is of crucial importance to our producers, to our consumers and to our market.
The European regulations introduced in the area of animal protection are among the most stringent in the world. They result in higher production costs and may also distort competition with states whose legislation is less strict in this respect. This is why I call on the Commission to ensure that meat products or other products of animal origin imported from nonEU countries meet European standards. What we would like to see is for the Commission to be able to carry out inspections in abattoirs authorised to export their products to the European Union, confirming that, in addition to the health certificates already awarded, regulations on animal protection are also being respected.
I believe that animal welfare standards in Europe are absolutely paramount to the fact that we produce high-quality meat. We want to make sure that it is slaughtered carefully and to high standards, both for hygiene and for animal welfare. I do actually welcome the idea of mobile slaughterhouses, because I think this will be extremely good. I also think we have to be careful, because many small slaughterhouses in Europe have been closed down in the past - and in my own Member State that has happened - so we want to make sure we have got proper regulation, but not too much regulation that will actually close them down.
I am going to be quite controversial now. I believe that animals are born into this world and we, as man, decide exactly how they are going to be slaughtered. I think the Commission must make up its mind. Either you accept religious slaughter and the fact that the animals are not stunned, so those animals in other countries which we want to be killed at Christmas can have the same process, or you actually stand up for what I believe to be right, and that is that we, as man, decide how an animal is to be slaughtered and that animals should be stunned before slaughter. I think it is absolutely clear that this should happen. In some Member States there is pre-stunning and post-stunning of animals under both halal slaughter and under Jewish slaughter. I wonder why it cannot happen in the whole of Europe, because we have to be absolutely certain that we treat all animals the same. While I accept subsidiarity, I also want to see the Commission put pressure on Member States to make sure that we have proper slaughtering and stunning in the future.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in this debate I think the issue of animal welfare has been narrowed down too much to the question of whether or not we should use stunning. It is not that I am against stunning, it is just that we must realise that stunning was originally introduced, not out of concern for animal welfare, but for economic reasons, to be able to slaughter animals in factory farming, which involves mass killing in slaughterhouses, without affecting and lessening the quality of the meat through the anxiety caused by slaughter.
Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to add my voice to those wishes, and I am glad the Commissioner's last speech in Parliament concerns the presentation of what is truly a good draft and a good regulation, and indeed the majority of those who have spoken in this discussion are in full agreement here. I very much wish that the final result of this work, this joint work of Parliament, the Commission and the Council, will not significantly impair what the Commission has proposed, because the Commission has indeed made very good proposals. However, in the approach to animal protection, in those measures which aim to improve the welfare of animals, there are two important things.
The second source is a lot of smaller changes that, in many ways, have been in the pipeline for a long time but, rather than have a string of reports changing the rules on minor points, we have grouped them together. Some of these are technical; some are clarifying and make our rules more readable, such as the one that puts together Rules 141, 142 and 143 into a single codified text governing how we actually organise our debates in plenary. Related to that is the innovative amendment to say that we should have this blue card procedure to be able to interrupt each other. Mr Duff for instance, right now, may want to put a question to me about what I said, and I would let him do so for 30 seconds under this rule, if it is adopted. I am sure, Mr President, you would already let him do so now if he wanted, but, fortunately, he does not want to.
So there are some innovative features that should make our debates a little more lively. I remember when I first proposed the catch-the-eye period at the end of ordinary debates, everyone said: oh, no, we cannot do that, it will mess up the speaking time of the groups, and so on. Yet we now do it, and it is an accepted part of our procedures and very much welcomed, I think, by most Members. I would suggest that maybe the blue card procedure will be the same: there are some hesitations now, but let us try it out, let us see how it works, and I am confident we can make it work.
There have also been some amendments which arose as we discussed this, either at committee stage or now in plenary. For instance, there was a suggestion that all final votes on legislation should automatically be by roll-call vote - I think that came from Ms Dahl. I welcome that amendment, and we have put it in my report. There have been suggestions from many Members that we put something in the rule about intergroups, if only actually to delimit very clearly what they are and what they are not, to show that they are informal and that they may not take over the responsibilities of parliamentary bodies.
Very often when we change the Rules of Procedure our colleagues get worried about what is happening. Most of them only realise what has happened and what changes we have made once it has come into effect, by which time it can no longer be changed. I firmly support most of the proposals which have been tabled, especially because they reflect not just your hard work, but also - as you mentioned - that of the parliamentary reform group chaired by Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, which prepared this proposal very well.
For our group, the most important point is, however, proportionality. In our Parliament, the committees have very strong roles. In preparing the votes here in Parliament they take a lot of the burden from this House by voting in committee. It is not just a simple question of procedure, but a question of democracy, that the committees reflect the proportions which exist in plenary when important issues are decided. I think this is a basic question of democracy and, on behalf of the PPE-DE, support the report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am one of those curious constitutional animals who think that the Rules of Procedure mirror our own work here in our own Parliament. So I think this is an important piece of work by Richard Corbett, who is the eminent specialist in this field. To his credit I must say that this is the second modification of the Rules of Procedure. There are things that have changed very recently and that we are changing again, because we have seen that the practice of our Parliament demands that those changes be made.
My three specific remarks: the first one concerns a modification in which I played a small part myself. It is the fact that we are trying to put into the Rules of Procedure this idea of an agora, of the possibility for citizens, too, to address the European Parliament and to participate in discussions before the European Parliament. I think this is a symbolically important initiative that we took together with my friend and colleague Gérard Onesta, and I think it would be a good thing if that were to be enshrined in the Rules of Procedure.
The second thing that is, I think, of importance is the change we have made to the own-initiative reports: the fact that, having seen how the own-initiative reports have been in practice, we are reintroducing the possibility for amendments, albeit by one 10th of parliamentarians. The third aspect is this blue card procedure. I am in favour of everything that will enliven our parliamentary discussions here, so this possibility for parliamentarians to interrupt one another in a civilised way and to speak like that is a good idea.
I have two or three quibbles, however. The first is on the point that Mr Szájer spoke about: the attempt to force committees to be rigidly proportionate to the disposition of parties in Parliament. I think it is actually perfectly proper for a political group to express a preference to put more of its members on a committee that it regards as especially important. I think that, if we pass Amendment 42, then the groups and Members will find it frustrating, and it will require, in the end, greater flexibility.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have never had much time for the great parliamentary reforms carried out by Mr Corbett - he is a friend of mine and we have worked together for many years, he is aware of this and he will not hold it against me - because they tend to turn our Parliament into a bureaucratic machine where the role of individual MEPs and minority groups and even the committees must be subject to the growing, partly arbitrary, decisionmaking power of the Conference of Presidents and the administration. In addition, they make the relationship between the primary committee and committees asked for an opinion in the legislative procedure confused and basically conflictual.
I must say I am staggered that this evening, in this debate, we are not talking about the things that we consider to be the fundamental problems in this procedural reform. The first thing is the confusion that will inevitably be created between the primary committee and the committee asked for an opinion, because when the primary committee rejects the amendments of the committee asked for an opinion, these amendments might end up directly in the Chamber, obviously creating an extremely risky potential for legal confusion - as we also incidentally saw in the case of REACH.
Lastly, Mr President, there is another element that concerns us very much. One of the outcomes to emerge from the working group on internal reform, of which I was a part, and that we originally considered positive, was the proposal to strengthen the powers and the role of the Committee on Petitions in a truly significant manner. In this reform, however, the role of the Committee on Petitions has been killed off, in the sense that it will no longer be possible for the Committee on Petitions to find its way directly to the Chamber except after unspeakable complications and possible conflicts with the competent committee.
(DE) Mr President, to reform the European Union is difficult, but to reform the European Parliament is even more difficult, as we have seen in the debate on the revision of the Rules of Procedure and the work of our fellow Member Richard Corbett. I would like to thank Mr Corbett for the truly enormous commitment he has shown, to bring the many different interests under one umbrella and to carry this revision of our Rules of Procedure through to the plenum. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will support this report.
. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President. Schadenfreude is the only true joy, says the cynic. However, even those of us who are not cynical naturally admit that Schadenfreude is a form of joy, and it is this sort of joy that I am feeling now. Why? Well, last year we in the June List and the Independence and Democracy Group started to request roll-call votes in all final votes. I remember how President Pöttering scolded us, derided us and claimed that it cost the earth. Now the committee is proposing that all final votes on legislative proposals be conducted as roll-call votes. And quite rightly, too! In order to be able to demand political responsibility from their MEPs, voters must be able to check how they voted. How did Mr Hannan, Mrs Wallis or Mrs Svensson vote, to name just a few of my favourite Members? This proposal constitutes an important step towards a democratic process and it strengthens voters' control of the 'yes-men' in this House. I would like to thank Mr Corbett for this and to thank the President for allowing me to speak.
May I secondly confirm what has been mentioned already. This report was actually split into two. There is another report which we have not brought to plenary yet - which we will have to revisit in the next Parliament - concerning how we adapt our procedures to the Lisbon Treaty if it comes into force. We were, of course, looking at this as preparation, without prejudice to the ratification that will, hopefully, take place tomorrow in the Czech Senate and later in the year in Ireland, but we will return to that with the preparatory work having been done if the Treaty is ratified.
Secondly, may I confirm that, indeed, there are rules here which revisit, as Mr Szájer pointed out, recent reforms that flowed from the first report of Dagmar Roth-Behrendt's reform working group. It concerns this question of initiative reports, where we have a procedure which many Members feel is a little bit too inflexible now. We have made it slightly more flexible. For a start, the debate will not just be a short presentation by the rapporteur, a reply from the Commission and that is it. There will be up to 10 minutes of catch-the-eye possible for such occasions.
Second, the point raised by Ms Frassoni about opinion-giving committees having the right to table amendments in plenary. I myself have grave doubts about whether that is a good idea or not, but it came from the reform working group on which you sat. It was endorsed by the Conference of Presidents. That was something that had a degree of consensus behind it, and therefore we are submitting it to the House for approval or, indeed, rejection. We will see how the House votes tomorrow.
Finally, I will not address the Committee on Petitions issues, because we are about to have a specific debate on that and I will come back to that point then. I will just finally say, in response to Mr Gollnisch, that he is wrong on two counts. This is not the same amendment that was rejected in committee. It is a different one, a different approach to the subject. I had grave reservations about the amendment that was submitted in the committee. I am happy to support the one that has been submitted to plenary.
However, the fact that it has waited so long and has put it on the agenda at the same time as my report means there is a slight interface on one point between our two reports, which Ms Frassoni alluded to in our previous debate. That is the matter of cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the committee responsible for the subject matter. Everyone agrees that they both have to cooperate and they need to work together, but there is an argument about what you could call the bottom line: if they disagree, who has the final say?
You can understand both sides. The members of the Petitions Committee feel that they have received petitions, they have looked into the matter, they may have had hearings, they may have had a visit, they have sometimes found something that is perhaps wrong in the legislation that the subject committee has dealt with, and they feel they have got to grips with that and should have the final say if the subject committee disagrees. On the other hand, you can understand the subject committee. Why should it suddenly find another committee responsible for the subject matter just because somebody sent a petition to that other committee? You can understand both sides.
I think that is a reasonable quid pro quo. I do not understand why Ms Frassoni said earlier that would destroy the Petitions Committee. I really have no understanding of how she could reach such a conclusion. Certainly, the members of the Petitions Committee in my group have told me that they are happy with that compromise and I think it is a workable compromise. It is a compromise. If you are an extremist on one side or the other of this argument you will not be happy, but I think it is a workable compromise. It blends in very nicely with the excellent report by Mr Onesta, and I think altogether this package will work.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Onesta said that his report is not revolutionary, but it is however an important reform, which strengthens the rights of citizens as well as the Committee on Petitions. The right to petition is a right accorded to citizens and a few improvements will be made, which will also encourage citizens to address questions to Parliament. I also think it is right that when it comes to the admissibility of a petition, it is not the chairman of the committee who should decide. Although I myself am chairman of a committee, I agree that if a quarter of the members think a subject should be discussed, then it must be discussed.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Onesta for his work and presence in Parliament. I would like to make a few remarks about his last report. I am convinced, as is Mrs Frassoni, that the right to petition is an important right, but I must say that the Committee on Petitions is a rather odd committee; it is important, interesting, but also odd. This mini court where everything and nothing is discussed is quite important but also interesting, and different from what we do.
I would like to come back to three points very briefly. Firstly, minority languages. I am in agreement, but this must not open the door to languages which are not fully legal being used in Parliament. Secondly, admissibility. I am in full agreement, and it is a good thing that the aim is to admit rather than reject petitions. Lastly, I would like to say that I agree with our chairman, Mr Leinen. The right of citizens' initiative indeed has nothing to do with the right of petition, which is a democratic, constitutional right regarding Parliament, and the two should not be confused.
In this respect, I naturally wanted to say that we support this report, but that we also feel that the subject of the relationship with the primary committee remains a thorny topic in the Corbett reform and at this point I also would like to say something to Mr Botopoulos: it is not that the Committee on Petitions is a strange committee, it is a committee that has a very specific role and on most occasions petitions are concerned with the application of Community law, they are concerned with breaches of directives and laws that do not evidently always have a very clear relationship with the primary committee.
I will continue my linguistic explanations with Mr Botopoulos's question. Obviously, there is no question of adding to this Tower of Babel, which is already extremely complex: just look at the number of interpreters still here this evening. We are quite clear that it is Parliament's Bureau which decides that petitions and correspondence with petitioners will be drawn up in other languages used in a Member State. These languages must therefore be recognised in the State, and the State must ask for this. This is currently the case for only four languages. If tomorrow I wanted to write in Volapük - an imaginary language - clearly it would not be recognised by any State, and neither Parliament nor the Bureau would reply in that language; all that is clearly specified.
Regarding issues of conflict between the committees to which Mr Corbett drew our attention, I would point out that my report states, in accordance with Rule 46 and Annex VI, that the Committee on Petitions can already seek the opinion of another committee which has 'specific responsibility for the issue under examination'. You say that, in this case, conflict could still arise. Well, we have put in place an arbiter, since the Committee on Petitions will not be able to issue own-opinion reports or go against an own-initiative report of a responsible committee unless the Conference of Presidents allows it. We have a referral system, namely the Conference of Presidents, which will decide whether it is down to the Committee on Petitions or the responsible committee to take action, in the event that both committees are unable to reach an agreement. We have therefore made provision for a safeguard in any case.
We have proposed a line for the next steps, because this can only be a first step. We have not come up with an answer to the economic and financial crisis. But we are ready to take a new step, to achieve a breakthrough in the development of a new framework for the financial markets, which will lead to the simplification of financial market regulation and to Europeanisation, which will create certainty on the financial markets and stability for all market participants, which represents a development of the financial markets, is a reaction to the financial crisis and safeguards the decentralised sector.
The second area is securitisation, the granting of loans. For the first time we are introducing the rule that a loan can only be granted if the lender holds a retention for securitisation in its books. We have provided for a retention of at least 5%, but we have commissioned CEPS to look into whether an increase is reasonable and to publish its findings in a Commission review before the end of the year, taking international developments into consideration. This is an important signal to the markets: without a retention there is nothing. The retention leads to transparency and also to better control.
Cofinancing of this kind for the committees and the supervisory authorities can to a large degree help to ensure that they fulfil their mandates independently and efficiently. The programme must be flexibly designed and adequately funded to ensure that the requirements of at least the level 3 committees, including CESR, CEIOPS and CEBS, are covered. The Commission proposal was 40% below what the level 3 committees considered necessary for the next four years. There was little appetite in the Council for substantially increasing the budget even though it was clear that considerable improvement of financial market supervision was called for.
At the end of the negotiations we had agreed on a figure of approximately EUR 40 million over the four years: EUR 500 000 for the level 3 committees for 2009 and a further EUR 38.7 million from 2010 to 2013, 13.5 million of which are earmarked for these committees. As regards the financial reporting and auditing committees, the original Commission proposal for reform of this organisation was too weak. This means, therefore, that we, as Parliament, have been able to make improvements and, following the trialogue negotiations, we have achieved an acceptable result as far as the individual financial reference amounts and financing periods are concerned. The latest findings of the Larosière Group and of the report indicate that there are goods reasons why the Commission should present to Parliament and the Council no later than 1 July 2010 a report and the necessary legislative proposals for further reform of the regulation and oversight of the European financial markets to adapt this programme to the changes made.
I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Bowles and Mrs Berès. As this is my last speech in this Parliament, I would also like to thank the Commission, my fellow Members and the Council for their cooperation. It has been a pleasure to work with you all. Let me give you an example of a pleasing result of this cooperation. The Czech Presidency of the Council decided 30 minutes ago to accept the outcome negotiated in the trialogue negotiations. We have a proposal that we can adopt today and I am certain that the large Groups in this Parliament will also vote in favour of these proposals.
On the now famous 5% retention for securitisation, I am pleased to see that Parliament has resisted the call from industry to do away with what they had only last year characterised as complete nonsense. I would like to say that the retention rule has emerged as something that is not nonsense but plain common sense. It is now recognised by the G20 as a key measure to strengthen the financial system. Looking forward, the Commission will, without a shadow of a doubt, support any further efforts making the text even more watertight.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, we seem to be a succession of old hands rising to speak, but would that I were not making my last speech in the European Parliament in the worst economic situation of my lifetime - and that is a lifetime that started in the blighted 1930s - and would that I were not also having to speak in a debate on a piece of European legislation which is not, I am afraid, wholly satisfactory: the Capital Requirements Directive.
I and my group will support the compromise reached by rapporteur Karas with great skill and patience under heavy time pressure and in the current feverish economic circumstances. But I hope my colleagues who return here after the election will revert to the full codecision process, which can really fully test and refine our legislation. I fear that much of this over-hasty legislation will reveal unintended and untoward consequences. For example, I fear that the rules on large exposures, extolled by Commissioner McCreevy and prompted by genuine concerns about counterparty risk, will make it that much more difficult to reactivate the interbank money market to its full and desirable extent. I fear that the new retention rule, also extolled by Commissioner McCreevy, will, in fact, impede the revival of securitisation, which is an essential and predominantly beneficial mechanism for funding mortgages, car loans and consumer spending.
Commissioner, I deplore the absence of the Council Presidency. Mr McCreevy, you have made your mandate as commissioner for the internal market one of regulatory standstill. Unfortunately - I do not know how to phrase this - you should have changed your mind and ultimately taken the advice of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament which, when Mr Katiforis's report was presented, told you that legislation on rating agencies was needed, or you should have listened to our rapporteur, Mr Rasmussen, who told you that retention on securitisation needed to be introduced in the banking sector.
As for Mr Karas's report, I think it is an important report that we should adopt today, because it gives the signal, within the Union, to our banking sector and to all our G20 partners that retention must be introduced for securitisation. Own funds must be defined better. In future, there will need to be more transnational supervision of groups, and integrated supervision along the lines of Jacques de Larosière's report. Finally, we have to organise clearing houses for derivatives and credit default swaps.
I would also like to thank Mr Karas for the way in which we have been able to re-open the trialogue so that we will be able, in the period before this directive comes into force, to revise the retention threshold. Having ordered studies, and having given CEBS a mandate to determine under which conditions this retention should be expertly planned, we have been able to verify whether the 5% threshold that we are going to vote on today was the appropriate threshold, even more so now that we have corrected the scope of the retention by making what I believe was the right choice and getting rid of the guarantees sought by Mr Purvis.
As for Mr Hoppenstedt's report, I wish to thank him most sincerely, as I believe that, here, we are getting involved, usefully and positively. In the past, the Commission would tell us that it could not fund level 3 committees; today, it is possible even before these committees become agencies. We welcome this. At the rapporteur's instigation, both the operating costs and the project costs will thus be eligible for funding, and Parliament will have a clear insight into the nature of the projects being funded in this way. We can only welcome this; it is along the right lines.
Finally, in relation to accounting standards and the conditions in which international organisations contribute to their drafting, we have put pressure on these organisations so that they improve their governance and define their roles better. I believe that in this area, too, the European Parliament, with Mr Hoppenstedt's report, has done a useful job, and I wish to thank all of the rapporteurs, as well as this House if, as I hope, it adopts these two reports by a large majority later on.
European problems with securitisation came on the buy-side from the US, but fear has dried up our own securitisation. Banks have lost the main instrument that enabled them to sell on their loans - an important instrument because it freed up capital for further lending and was a major driver for growth. In 2006-7 European securitisations totalled EUR 800 billion: EUR 526 billion supporting European mortgages and tens of billions each on car purchases, credit card spending and SME loans - yes, including something like EUR 40 billion of German SME loans. These are the very areas where the credit crunch is biting hardest. It is no coincidence. Because we have to face the fact that bank lending is limited by their capital and they are stuck until either more capital is raised or the loan sold on. So the sooner that we can get Europe's quality control securitisation working, the better.
Ultimately, it will be intelligent supervisory vigilance that will prevent future new abuses rather than regulation for the old and gone. On Level 3 committees we can see that, despite the problems and failures in supervision, it is Parliament that has recognised better than Member States that holes cannot be plugged without resources. It has followed this by demanding more resources for those committees. International accounting and audit bodies will also benefit from more diversified neutral funding and the EU can lead off on this, but not indefinitely if other countries do not join in. I am pleased to have clarified that. Funding should also be sought from the user-side such as investors.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, today's economic crisis is a crisis of over-production and over-accumulation of capital. It is, as everyone now admits, a crisis of the capitalist system itself. Efforts to present this crisis as a financial crisis, as a liquidity crisis, are being made in order to mislead the workers and to avoid acknowledging the real causes, which lead to increased unemployment, reduced incomes, flexible labour relations and the all-out attack on them.
The measures being taken to supervise accounting standards with controls on lines of credit and own funds, not only fail to limit the unaccountability of the banks; in essence they are measures which the banks themselves are seeking in order to safeguard that unaccountability beneath superficial supervision and control, supervision which, instead of protecting the interests of small depositors who have been and continue to be at risk from the economic crisis, will safeguard the conditions of competition of the banks and will allow new tools to be used to increase their profits.
The reserve which the banks demonstrated even to their cofinancing by the state, in return for even minimal controls, is typical of their stand, a stand of unaccountability which, in the jungle of the market, again results in increased profits and prices, while the workers are again being called upon to pay the costs of the crisis. The workers are not being deceived or disorientated by the decisions of the European Union to end the crisis. They know that these decisions put the entire weight of the crisis onto their shoulders and seek to safeguard even greater profits for capital.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President. We have now gone through a global financial meltdown and it is continuing to cause us problems. We need then to analyse why this has happened before we begin to act at EU level. I would like to say the following. Firstly, we have an ownerless capitalism. The large companies are no longer governed by their shareholders, but by pension funds, insurance companies and other types of fund. This leads to a situation in which officials can govern however they want to, and they do this in a way that suits their own interests, which are in increasing the risks enormously, and then the result is what we are seeing now. We have banks that are 'too big to fail', as the catchphrase goes. The Glass-Steagall Act was intended to prevent this, but it has been abolished in the US. We ought to consider whether this might not be part of the solution. We have deposit guarantees for small-scale savers and even quite large-scale savers. This means that people depositing money in banks do not give two hoots whether the banks are safe, as they know that taxpayers will protect them. This is a problem. The heads of the central banks do not burst the bubbles, but rather are praised when they constantly ensure that the bubbles can continue to grow ad infinitum.
Alan Greenspan gained an immensely good reputation for something which, in practice, is a significant explanation for why things have become so bad. Subprime lending was the start of this and a fundamental part, and it was introduced by politicians who are now saying that we will solve this by taking more power away from the market. I doubt that. The regulatory system in Basel II was circumvented by means of shadow banking. Now we are talking about new rules for capital. If this is more shadow banking, it is not going to help. I therefore believe that we should tackle this in a different way and ask what should be done. Then we will discover that very little should be done at EU level. This is a global problem and should be dealt with elsewhere.
I would like to make a couple of remarks. 1. As the rapporteur responsible for microcredit, I welcome the fact that the report featured the requirement, which also appeared in my report, for a risk management system to be devised reflecting microcredit features, such as no traditional collateral and excess. I hope this will happen as soon as possible. I would like to thank Mrs Berès for her amendment to the proposal. 2. I was highly critical of the supervisory arrangements even during the debate on the 2005 amendment. This applies particularly to the supervision of parent institutions, which actually also raises constitutional concerns with regard to deployment in the country of the subsidiaries, although subsidiaries are generally located in the new Member States.
This vulnerability is reduced, if not actually stopped by the collegiate system which, in my view, is still only a step in the right direction, but not the real solution. Nevertheless, for the sake of compromise, I regard this situation as progress mainly because the current compromise also advocates that the draft regulation on the integrated supervisory system should be produced quickly based on the De Larosière material, which will already be good, in our opinion, as well as providing a very significant benefit for communitarisation.
I would like to say a special word of thanks for the solidarity shown to the countries outside the euro zone in connection with the amendment to Article 153(3) as, with the acceptance of my proposal, the separate risk premium will not apply until the end of 2015 to the credits for these countries, which they have generally received in euros from the public finances or central bank. Taking all these points into account, I propose block-voting on the compromise, including the 5% retention, since this in itself marks some measure of progress.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has made it clear that the financial market framework of the European Union must be revised. My Group supports the proposals developed in the trialogue negotiations, especially the proposals for a new Capital Requirements Directive for banks. Risk-based supervision will increase, the abuse of special purpose vehicles will disappear and the quality of structured products will improve as a result of the 5% retention for securitisation. However, I regret that the rule for in-year interbank loans is very restrictive and that silent capital contributions are accepted as full-value capital for a transitional period only.
(DE) Mr President, I would first like to say that we have started on this second project, which is under discussion today, to put financial market regulation on a normal footing. The financial market crisis can be attributed partly to a failure of the markets and partly to a failure of regulation. We have drawn up a list of measures that must be regulated by the rating agencies. We have adopted resolutions on the Capital Requirements Directive, on managers' salaries, on hedge funds, on accounting regulations and on the European supervisory structure. Today, we are dealing with the second point.
Negotiations are being conducted on the basis of a vote in committee, not in the normal first reading procedure but on the basis of an agreement reached between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. I acknowledge that Mr Karas has achieved many things. However, a large number of fellow Members, like me, are of a different opinion, as Mr Klinz pointed out. This primarily relates to the retention for securitisation. The securitisation market and the financial market crisis arose not least because financial market products without own risk were created. That is why the banks no longer trust each other, because no one has securities for which they take responsibility through risk. The proposal is for a 5% retention. In my opinion, 10% is far more appropriate and that is why I have tabled an amendment. I am certain that the Council, if it accepts all the other things, will have to consider this 10% retention. We, as Parliament, have a responsibility to give citizens further assurances that a global financial market crisis of this kind can never be repeated.
The other dossier on the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) is not, in my view, a good example of better regulation under the Lamfalussy process that we have developed in the 10 years I have been active. I will support the results because we need to send a strong signal to the market, but I would have preferred a more principles-based approach and more transparent consultation in the political process. This was the pressure of obtaining this hasty result. I hope that, at the end of the year when there will be a fuller review of the CRD, the Lamfalussy process will also be taken properly into account. I strongly recommend that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs reinstate this process.
In my last speech, I would also link to what Ms Berès has said and would say to Mr McCreevy that it is a pity that what he has done to regulate these financial markets is really too little and too late. I want to express my appreciation to my colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their cooperation over these 10 years. I hope they get a Commissioner in the new term who will be exclusively devoted to the financial markets, handling a portfolio which really focuses on this very important subject that brought us into these dire straits nowadays, and who will really be devoted to regulation and proper European supervision of the financial markets.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to drain a bog you do not ask the fattest frogs how they would like it to happen. That is exactly the problem with the report on the Capital Requirements Directive, which is under discussion today. If we do not wish to still be setting up bad banks in ten or twenty years' time then we must get banks and credit institutions to assume a significant business risk if they continue to deal in critical products. Five per cent is not significant.
The financial institutions require a solid capital base and need to compete in a balanced way through a harmonised definition of own funds, in particular of hybrid instruments, and a proportionate strengthening of the management of major risks. It is vital to bring in more transparency and align the interests of issuers and investors in securitisation processes. Retaining at least 5% of securitised products on the balance sheet, avoiding multiple use of such products and stepping up the due diligence of investors are steps in this direction. Creating colleges of supervisors for cross-border groups and making the role of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors more robust are moves towards more fully integrated European supervision.
- (CS) Mr President, I firmly believe that the measures we are debating here should also be of a preventive nature, since the situation is very grave. The volume of financial derivatives on the world market is five times larger than the worldwide gross domestic product and this is a bubble that is going to burst, with the risk that gross domestic product will drop dramatically, particularly in the United States. The whole world, including European countries, would suffer. There is also the danger of hyperinflation, since the prevailing idea, especially in the United States, appears to be that all problems can be resolved by pouring more and more money into the system, even though this strategy displays serious shortcomings. I therefore believe that the preventive aspect is highly important, and that some of the more controversial instruments used on the financial markets, such as shadow banking for example, should simply be banned.
As regards the Hoppenstedt report, the positive outcome of Coreper this morning paves the way for an adoption at first reading. An agreement on this strategic initiative is very welcome because it sends the right signal: a signal of our determination to respond to the financial crisis, to strengthen financial supervision and to improve the standard assessing process for financial reporting and auditing. But this is only a first step in a very long process. In the months to come, I look forward to continuing this work with you in the new Parliament.
Let me just make a point concerning securitisation. Mrs Bowles made a pretty strong contribution in this regard. She is very much for securitisation and pointed out the good aspects of it and the amount of money that is contributed to the capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises and to lenders at large in all Member States of the European Union. In case there is any impression that I do not see the benefits of securitisation over the years, may I say that I certainly do! In my previous capacity, and long before I came here, I was aware of the benefits of securitisations. However, the issue is what proportion the originating securitiser should hold in that particular matter. I accept what Mrs Bowles said: that in future a holding of whatever percentage will attract a capital charge. One cannot be certain as to when the current financial crisis will end. But, irrespective of when that end is going to be, I think we can be absolutely certain in years to come that financial institutions will be required, at all levels, to hold more significant and more quality capital against their lending. I will not be here - but many of you will - but, whatever the end is, that will be the inevitable outcome of this particular financial crisis - not immediately, not maybe in the medium term, but in the longer term that will be a certainty. If I looked into my crystal ball, that is what I would see in years to come. So it is the percentage which is being debated. People know my views on this. I have held very strong views on this for a long period of time.
Various amendments have been put forward during the Council of Ministers stage and with the European Parliament about different 'outs' on one thing and another, which my officials, at my request, are very, very strongly against, because I strongly believe in the very simple proposition that 5% of something is better than 55% of zero. The more outs that there are - we can have 5%, 10%, 15% - 15% of zero is still zero. That is why I welcome the opportunity that the Commission in its report by the end of this year will come back to this particular matter in order to ensure that the wording is fairly tightened up. I am strongly of that view because I do not wish to see particular outs. But I readily appreciate what Mrs Bowles and others have said regarding the merits of securitisations for the capital market. I hope I have never given the impression that I did not.
Finally, may I, too, join with the President in wishing those Members who are retiring well in their future careers, whatever they might be. I have known most of them in some capacity or other in my five years here and I appreciate their contributions, even though I have not always agreed with them. I suppose I should not single out any one person, but I would like to make special mention of Mr Purvis in this regard. I always found his advice to be wise, measured, considered and not dogmatic, and I wish him, in particular, a very successful future.
It is therefore absolutely clear that this is an important step forward, but it is not the final step, because we are announcing, giving notice of and promoting further steps in this agreement and specifying the direction for this debate. In other words, the debate will continue, it has to continue. But I believe that it is important that we send a clear signal now, in this legislative period, that we are competent, that we wish to create trust, security and stability, that we can react quickly and that we know what still needs to be done in the future. I therefore call on you to take this step together and with a big majority.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I have already given my opinion on certain things in the first round of talks. However, I would like to say once again very clearly that the world, including our partners in the United States, China and other places, is watching the European Union, the Council, the Commission and Parliament to see how we will react to the crisis. I have already said that there has been a reaction, which we notice in certain rules that are being re-drafted. Things are moving somewhat in the US in terms of the Reinsurance Directive and other things like that, such as the collaterals. Moreover, the received wisdom is that, if we, as Europeans, do not have anything concrete in our hands, then our partners will not react.
I believe that it is important to perhaps point out once again that I was involved in the introduction of the European Single Market, as coordinator during the introduction of the euro and other things like that. These are milestones that have naturally informed this work and also policy making. It has been fun working with you all, and I should once again like to thank my fellow Members, the Commission and the Council - I have already said that - for their cooperation. I wish all those who will voluntarily not be returning all the best for the future.
There are many tasks, including the task of conveying just how important the European Union is and what an important job the European Parliament does. It is also important for the elections to be held in Germany on 7 June and elsewhere from 4 to 7 June that people's attention is drawn to just how important our work is. I hope that there will then be a high turnout. Once again, many thanks to you all and all the best for the future. This is my last speech, as I have already said.
I understand that, at present, in the election campaign, many of my fellow Members are becoming nervous. However, this is tantamount to an accusation of deception, fraud, and unjust enrichment on my part. It is an accusation of a serious criminal offence. Mr Martin defames, denounces and maligns Parliament, its Members, even the officials and, especially, his Austrian colleagues time and again in public with distortions, half-truths and untruths, and the extent of what I can tolerate has been exceeded. I demand the retraction of this accusation, an apology and a condemnation by the Presidency.
The Court has overturned the decision taken by this House on 24 May not to confirm my mandate following the proclamation by the national authorities, and the European Parliament has been ordered to pay costs. The intention of the Court's timely decision was to restore Parliament's legitimate composition before the mandate came to an end, but at 5 p.m. on 4 May President Pöttering gave this Chamber a one-sided, ambiguous and confused account of the affair, calling once again on the Committee on Legal Affairs to confirm my powers even though he was well aware that this was only a notation. Not only this, but he also failed to request an extraordinary meeting of the Commission, because this was the final sitting of the parliamentary term, unless he decides to extend my mandate to the next term too.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I am making a request for referral back to committee and I would like to explain why. When discussing this legislation we talked a lot about impact assessments. That is to say: every time you introduce a new rule you have to be able to say what the impact will be. Concerning the new rules that we are going to vote on today in the Corbett report, we do not understand what the consequences will be of dramatically changing the way in which we make legislation by allowing the possibility of committees and multiple rapporteurs being able to present completely contradictory procedures and amendments for the vote in plenary.
Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, the reform of the European Union is difficult enough but the reform of the European Parliament appears to be even more difficult. However, I must say to Mrs Frassoni that this reform process has now lasted two and a half years. We had a reform group that Mrs Frassoni herself belonged to. Our Committee complied with the conclusions of the reform group point by point. In other words, today we are presenting in plenary something that took two and a half years to discuss, debate and decide. There is therefore no reason why this point should be referred back to committee. Today, we should complete this final act and prepare for the new legislative period with many improvements to our work. I am therefore voting against the motion tabled by Mrs Frassoni.
As the European Parliament, we are the directly elected representatives of the citizens of the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, we all embody the rich diversity of our European continent and reflect, through our political families, the huge variety of convictions and attitudes. What is more, a few days ago we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the historic enlargement of the European Union, the reunification of our continent on the basis of our common values. In the words of our Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007, 'We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better'.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have made every effort to ensure that Parliament is represented, through its President and through representatives of the political groups, in bodies of importance for shaping our common future. The President of the European Parliament now participates in the annual meetings of the Heads of State or Government of the G8 and in summits with third countries, such as the EU-Africa Summit, the EU-Latin America Summit and the EU-US Summit. Tomorrow morning, I will participate in the Troika summit on employment and tomorrow afternoon in the Summit for the inauguration of the Eastern Partnership in Prague.
It is also an achievement of this legislative period that the role of Parliament in the European Councils is no longer restricted to the inaugural address by the President. Now Parliament also participates in the institutional and constitutional deliberations of the summits. At the Intergovernmental Conference that led to agreement on the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament was fully involved at the level of the Heads of State or Government through the participation of its President and, at the Intergovernmental Conference itself, through a delegation consisting of three Members. This is a huge step forward.
Ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the working methods and procedures of the European Parliament was and still is a major project. To this end, the Conference of Presidents set up a working group equipped with a detailed mandate, in which all Groups were represented. The work was completed successfully. Much - approximately 80% - of what was proposed by the working group has been put into effect and implemented. This includes the reorganisation of the plenary debates, the reform of the legislative process, the improvement of the work done in committee with enhanced cooperation between the committees as well as the possibility of legislative initiative reports or conflicting resolutions.
As Members of the European Parliament, we can offer an additional perspective in Middle East relations, as we can think and act outside conventional diplomatic channels. With this in mind, I have campaigned for a working group to be set up to deal with the Middle East crisis. Especially in the light of new developments in the Middle East it is important that we resolutely support a two-State solution - Israel within secure borders and a Palestinian State within secure borders. We must not allow these principles to be called into question.
We must breathe life into the foundations on which the European Union is based. That is why I am particularly thankful to you for your encouragement and continuing support for my initiative to establish a 'House of European History'. In particular, I should like to thank not only Vice-President Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez for his unflagging support but also my fellow Members in this Chamber. The 'House of European History' will be used as a place where our European identity can be remembered and renewed. The basic decisions for establishing the House have already been taken.
I extend my sincerest thanks to my personal staff in my Cabinet, but, above all, I thank you, fellow Members, especially the Bureau and the chairmen of the political groups, for your trustful cooperation. We have just had another meeting of the Conference of Presidents. On Monday evening we had a meeting of the Bureau, and we will have another meeting today. On substantive issues of European democracy, hardly any contentious, really controversial decisions were taken, and we agreed on the basic issues. A bond of trust was created, for which I am sincerely thankful.
However, rather than running through a tedious list of directives and regulations, I would like to stress how much, behind the often very technical legislation that we debate and adopt here, our joint work has meaning. This meaning is the general interest of all Europeans. It is often said that Europe is removed from its citizens, but are issues such as toy safety, research into the prevention of rare diseases or of Alzheimer's disease, consumer protection, environmental protection measures and the fight against global warming, energy policy or the defence of human rights around the world really removed from citizens' daily lives?
Under your presidency, this Parliament has seen other major advances. I am thinking of the internal reform, which you have brought to fruition and which will make our institution more transparent and more effective, and of the new statute for Members of the European Parliament and their assistants. Under your presidency, this Parliament has multiplied the initiatives within the framework of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, doing justice to the great wealth of cultures and faiths in our society, and sending out the best possible image of Europe: that of openness and tolerance. Under your presidency, Parliament has seen the importance that it attaches to the future of the Mediterranean region and its desire to help bring about peace in the Middle East.
Mr President, on 25 March 2007, you signed on our behalf the Berlin Declaration commemorating 50 years of the European Union. That declaration reminds those who might have forgotten the objective of our daily work, in other words the integration of a free, democratic, tolerant Europe that respects the rule of law. By taking the initiative of creating a House of European History, you are giving a lasting dimension to the work carried out by yourself and your predecessors and by all those who, in their own way, have contributed to our common history.
This is not the time to review your work. The legacy of a President of the European Parliament is always subject to political scrutiny. You can agree or disagree with one thing or another. A review of the President's work must focus on what the President has done for the success of this House. You have presented your conclusions. There is nothing to add. The question therefore remains: what has the President, as a human being, done for this House? For me and my colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament it is clear that you have conferred dignity on this House, both inside and outside.
This House does not always conduct itself with dignity. But that is true of all parliaments worldwide. The dignity of a multinational joint parliamentary assembly of well over 700 Members from 27 countries, who belong to eight different parliamentary groups, who belong to different faiths, who have different skin colours, who come from different political traditions, who have experienced different historical development, must be safeguarded. To unite them and to give them a sense of unity through their own representation is difficult. That is exactly what you have done. And for that you deserve our sincere thanks.
Mr President, you have tackled many activities in your two-and-a-half-year term of office. To underpin what I have said about the way in which you have exercised your office, on behalf of our Group I should like to single out one point on which we fully shared your view and where you gave this House a voice that extended far beyond the bounds of political divisions, and hence gave a voice to disenfranchised people in a place that is assembled in exactly the way I have described. You raised your voice against the scandal in Guantanamo at a time when it was not easy to do so. That, Mr President, will remain an enduring milestone in your term of office. You have shown that the requirement you placed on yourself to be a tolerant and cosmopolitan person on the one hand and to be committed to your fundamental Christian understanding on the other has been met.
I hope you will write about your experiences and impressions. They will be too interesting to be left in the cold and powerful hands of oblivion. Moreover, as the poet Emerson taught us, there is no such thing as history, only biography. This Parliament has become more powerful over the years. It will be more powerful still under the Lisbon Treaty, if and when it is eventually ratified. It will be interesting to see what plans future presidents will bring to expand on the role that you have played, projecting the common values and principles that we hold dear.
But today I think I can speak for many when I say that you have earned our respect and affection. Like you, this is my last plenary speech in my current role. Having led my group since 2002, I have a touch of what we call in English the seven-year itch. Although I will not sit in this seat again, I know you are aware that I am keen to try sitting where you are. President, on behalf of my group, I thank you. I thank the session services and the interpreters and all the staff who have contributed to the very fine job you have done as President of our House.
Events - tragic ones, in many instances - have followed one another thick and fast during this term, and on many occasions, particularly during the last two and a half years, Parliament, through you, Mr President, has been able to perform a crucial role in mediating proposals. Ours has become an increasingly obvious political role that must help us to overcome the party differences that divide us in our own countries so that we can achieve shared goals in the common interest of our peoples and ensure more justice, peace and safety in the world.
When, two and a half years ago, I stood against you as a candidate for the Presidency of the European Parliament on behalf of my group, I laid great emphasis on the need for the President of Parliament to represent an institution free from the interests of the Member States and the pressures exercised by financial lobbies, to guide an equally free administration chosen on the basis of merit and not of political loyalty, and to be able to speak to an increasingly divided and indifferent public. At the time, we very strongly criticised the joint decision taken by yourself and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to rule out any attempt to relaunch the constitutional debate following the 2005 referendums, an enormous mistake that made it easier for the States to reappropriate the process of European reform.
Two and a half years later, we in the Verts/ALE Group would assess your work, President Pöttering, as having its ups and downs. We approved and supported your work in the Middle East, particularly your work in the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. We appreciated your unwavering proEuropean belief, the idea of a Parliament open to citizens, groups, associations and the boldest cultural initiatives, and your determination over the Assistants' Statute.
Yet it is also clear, Mr President, that, under your presidency, our Parliament has continued its gradual transformation from an institution that demands and fights for democracy to an assembly that is all too often submissive and careful not to rock the boat of this or that government. It has resigned itself to not making this fight or transparency privileged areas in relation to which voters have visibility - one need only think of the entirely orchestrated failure of the working party on lobbies, which has come to an end today having achieved nothing despite a very explicit resolution approved a year ago, or the silence on the matter of the two seats in Strasbourg and Brussels and on that of the waste of money and CO2 that is incomprehensible to our electorate.
Thank you, Mr Wurtz. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of you all I should like to thank Mr Wurtz, who has been a Member since 1979 and will now leave Parliament. Our thanks also go to three other fellow Members, who have been here since 1979 and will now leave: Klaus Hänsch, a former President, Ingo Friedrich, former Vice-President and Quaestor, and Karl von Wogau, former Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and currently Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence. I should like to extend my sincere thanks on behalf of you all to these four and to all other departing fellow Members for their huge commitment. Thank you very much.
The defining moment for me in this House was when we had the French say 'no', we had the Dutch say 'no' and then we had the Irish say 'no', and this Parliament wilfully carried on ignoring the wishes of the people. You just do not get it, do you? 'No' means 'no', and it is truly incredible that 499 Members of this House voted to ignore the Irish 'no' vote and to continue with the Treaty. What kind of a Parliament is this? If you believed in democracy, you would not just bulldoze aside those three referendum results.
Worse still, you are now so fearful of public opinion - you know that you are losing the argument - that you have sunk to abuse. I have had Mr Watson saying that I behave like an English football hooligan, when all I did was to gently point out that Commissioner Barrot is a convicted embezzler. Gary Titley said that I was a paranoid reactionary living on the fringes of society. Well, he may have a point, I do not know; but Danny Cohn-Bendit, that great champion of free speech, said that opponents of the Treaty were mentally ill, and Martin Schulz, the leader of the Socialists, said after one of the 'no' votes that we must not bow to populism and that the 'no' votes opened the door to fascism.
Mr President, some colleagues may find this hard to believe but I am going to miss you. In all the time I have known you, first as leader of the Christian Democrats and then as President of this Parliament, you have been a model of dignity, restraint and courtesy. You are an Anglophile as well as a Europhile and you represent all that is best in the integrationist tradition. You will be very relieved, no doubt, to hear that I cannot recall ever having agreed with you.
You will remember how we clashed over your interpretation of this House's Rules of Procedure. Those of us who wanted referendums on the Constitutional Treaty had made our point in peaceable explanations of vote. Our right to do so was set out unequivocally in the Rules of Procedure. You chose arbitrarily to disapply those rules - you did not seek to change them, which would have required a certain amount of time, you simply disregarded them. This is not the time to have that argument all over again. Instead, let me say this: the President of this Chamber is meant to embody the entire House, including those who espouse minority views, and when you treat us differently you open the door to despotism. For example, virtually every month there are demonstrations here about something or other and they are tolerated, but when we held up placards with the one word 'referendum' you sent in the ushers to snatch away our banners and several of us were later fined.
Colleagues, I do not expect to change your minds about the desirability of centralising power in Brussels. But, from your own point of view, I would urge you to be a bit more even-handed in your dealings with those of us who are the minority. If only you could conquer your reflexive dislike for us, you might find that it would bolster your own democratic credentials. All organisations need their critics. Your insistence that the EU is an absolute good and that any criticism of it is either dishonest or xenophobic has done you no favours, because without critical scrutiny the Brussels institutions become bloated, self-serving and corrupt.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am grateful to you for this opportunity to say a few words on behalf of the Presidency and on behalf of the Council, in response to you and to the interventions from the representatives of the political groups. It is particularly significant for us that the five years of this legislature have coincided with the first five years of membership of the European Union for the Czech Republic and for the other countries which joined at that time. All the more so, given that the Czech Republic has had the privilege of holding the Council Presidency as this legislature draws to a close.
I would first like to pay tribute to you, Mr President, for the exemplary manner in which you have led this institution throughout the last two and a half years. It is a powerful witness to your qualities, in particular of fairness and integrity, that you are held in such respect by this Parliament, a respect which clearly cuts across party political divisions. As one of the relatively few Members first elected back in 1979, you have been able to bring your considerable experience, wisdom and knowledge to this office. Speaking in particular on behalf of the Presidency, I can only say that we have very much appreciated all your qualities in the contacts we have had both before and during our Presidency. On behalf of the Council, may I wish you all the best for the future.
During the course of the last five years, this Parliament has made effective use of its powers and prerogatives, not least in the important area of codecision where the Council and Parliament find themselves on opposite sides of the table, sometimes with very different views and objectives. Despite these differences, both institutions work together to ensure that the system delivers. We can disagree and we can argue constructively, but we do so within a framework of agreed rules and procedures. I think both institutions can take some pride in our shared commitment to making the system work, and the last five years have provided plenty of examples that it does work and work very effectively.
If I may be permitted to make a personal comment, I should like to thank you warmly for your, at all times, friendly and courteous approach to your work. You not only acted politely but also took corrective action when necessary. And you were always gentlemanlike. I should also like to emphasise how important it was for this Parliament and for the entire European Union that you had the courage and the willingness to defend the democratic principles and privileges of this Parliament, even against Heads of State where necessary.
Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank you for your largely favourable reviews. I wish all my fellow Members who are not standing for re-election all the best for the future and I hope that we will meet again. To all my fellow Members who are standing for re-election and who are re-elected, I should like to say that I hope that we, provided of course that I am re-elected, will continue our good work. What the chairmen of the political groups have said today has encouraged me to continue along the path towards a unified Europe. Many thanks to you all and I hope we will all see each other again.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, on the basis of Rule 154 and Rule 155(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to endorse the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to change the voting order of the amendments and to put Amendments 1 c, p, 2, 5, 6 and 9 to the vote before Compromise Amendment 10. This also relates, among other things - perhaps there is something else on your voting lists - to the fact that, following the motion adopted by our Group yesterday, Compromise Amendment 10 will no longer be supported by the ALDE Group. As regards the voting procedure, Rule 154 explains which amendment is to be dealt with first when there are corresponding or conflicting requests. It is important to us that a court ruling be issued before any intervention in the behaviour of individuals can take place. That is why we have withdrawn the amendment.
Mrs Harms, no one in this House wishes to curtail the right to free Internet access. We have incorporated this aspect into the compromise, which we discussed with the Czech President-in-Office of the Council over many months. All political parties were heavily involved in these discussions. I request that the proposed order be kept and that the change to the voting order now being proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe be rejected.
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, I would first of all like to point out that, in relation to the request for a change on the voting list, if I have understood rightly, if the compromise was included by the services, using their common sense, before groups tabled the amendment, it is because it goes further than Amendment 46. It includes clauses that are not limited merely to restricting access to the Internet but that also include all devices that may adversely affect users' rights.
I took the step before this vote of taking advice from the services, and I have listened very carefully to what has been said. I have the power as President under Rule 155(2) to decide on the order of vote. It seems to me that this issue is of such importance, both within and outside this House, that it would be appropriate to vote on the earlier amendments, but I do this also on the basis procedurally that, as I understand it, Amendment 10 was a compromise that came forward only after the committee vote. So it seems to me that there are both procedural and other reasons why we should reverse the order of the vote.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, as things stand at present, there are 89 amendments to this report. It is totally chaotic, and the vote that we are going to take will not allow us to hold a truly objective debate with the Council and the Commission. These 89 amendments are all totally at odds with each other. I propose we refer this report back to committee because, as Mrs Estrela said, we have plenty of time to do so.
Madam President, the rules are very clear that, after the vote, every Member has the right to make an explanation of vote for up to 60 seconds. I am conscious that our interpreters have been here for a long time. I am conscious that we are keeping a lot of people from their lunch. May I suggest a compromise that was used by your fellow Vice-President, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, the last time that this happened, which is to allow people to make explanations of vote one person after another, which speeded up proceedings very considerably.
The European Commission's Communication COM(2007) 281 set all the European institutions a challenge: 'The time has come to look at Brazil as a strategic partner as well as a major Latin American economic actor and regional leader'. This partnership was established on 4 July 2007 in Lisbon during the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union. On 12 March 2009 the European Parliament adopted a recommendation to the Council which stated that 'the Strategic Partnership should provide for the establishment of a regular structured dialogue between the Members of the Brazilian National Congress and Members of the European Parliament'.
Despite this statement of principle and my calls to the President of this House, I note with sadness that Parliament is sticking with the anachronistic option of making Brazil the only BRIC economy without an independent parliamentary delegation. This contradicts Parliament's own decision and demonstrates a deplorable inertia and short-term attitude, given Brazil's real importance in the world. I hope that future Members of this Parliament, particularly Portuguese Members, will help to change this regrettable state of affairs and establish direct and productive communication with the Brazilian National Congress.
However, under no circumstances can opportunistic reductions in the financial limits of the common agricultural policy be accepted on the pretext that it has unused resources. The Community budget cannot be recycled using the flexibility mechanism. Instead of this practice, it would be politically and materially expedient to debate an increase in the Community budget, so as not to affect existing Community policies, including the CAP, which will be called on to cover the financing of new policies to deal with the crisis and improve the competitiveness of the EU.
When administering the fund we must remember that the common agricultural policy is full of injustices and inequalities. Differences in subsidies, and so in the incomes of farmers, lead to the maintenance of these disproportions, and even to their increase. These disproportions concern not only the economic situation of residents of rural areas, but also the entire infrastructure, including access to the Internet. We must, therefore, remember that German farmers, for example, receive subsidies which are twice as much as Polish farmers receive, and three times more than Romanian farmers.
One of the most important changes is to give the President of the European Parliament the authority to invite national parliaments (of States which have signed a Treaty on the accession of a State to the European Union) to designate from among their own members a number of observers equal to the number of future seats in the European Parliament allocated to that State. Those observers shall take part in the proceedings of Parliament pending the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession, and shall have the right to speak in committees and political groups. They shall not have the right to vote or to stand for election to positions within Parliament.
in writing. - (SV) In the European Parliament's first reading of the telecoms package, a majority of Members voted in favour of Amendments 138 and 166, which have been under discussion. By doing so, the European Parliament made it clear that a court ruling should be required in order for someone to be excluded from the Internet, and that users have the right to free expression and to privacy. However, the Council chose to ignore the wishes of the European Parliament and deleted Amendments 138 and 166. The European Parliament and the Council have now agreed on a compromise. This compromise does not contain Amendments 138 and 166 in their original form. We therefore voted against the compromise in today's vote.
The June List and the Danish June Movement are keen for Amendments 138 and 166 to be included in the telecoms package and have therefore tabled a number of amendments which have been referred to as 'Citizens' Rights Amendments' by Internet activists and which have received the support of a couple of other political groups within the European Parliament. If our proposals had won the support of MEPs there would have been a good chance of the European Parliament and the Council finally agreeing on a telecoms package that seriously protects the rights and privacy of Internet users.
in writing. - (DE) We are trying today to support economic interests by hook or by crook. A flurry of copyright laws is suddenly to be introduced in a framework law for the provision of telecommunications. It is sufficient for the EU to introduce a duty to warn customers of the dangers of violating 'intellectual copyrights'; the sanctions could then be regulated at national level. Afterwards, each can then lay the blame on the other person. In this report, major software developers have also tried to incorporate a stumbling block for smaller developers.
Finally, because the displeasure of Mr Toubon, a visibly ardent defender of the Hadopi law, when Amendment 1, known to Internet users as the 'Bono' amendment, was adopted, was succeeded by his joy and approval when Mrs Trautmann made it known that this text would go to third reading, the overall compromise having been amended, the clearly demonstrated will of the majority of this Parliament risks being trampled over, as were the results of the referendums in France, the Netherlands, Ireland ...
in writing. - (EL) The 'telecommunications package' requested by the Commission and the Council constitutes a potential threat to civil rights. The amendments which we tabled called for the safeguarding of civil rights, universal access and transparency and freedom on the Internet as an area in which ideas are exchanged and not as a resource controlled by politicians and businessmen. Internet users are customers, but they are also citizens. We shall continue to fight for the protection of the individual freedoms of all European citizens.
in writing. - This report improves the way the principle of equal treatment applies to self-employed workers and assisting spouses in the EU. However, Ireland already provides that the spouses of self-employed persons may become self-employed PRSI contributors in their own right if a commercial partnership between the spouses is demonstrated. A person may, for example, choose to pay voluntary contributions which allow them to remain insured once they leave the compulsory PRSI system. Social insurance is a matter of national competence and for this reason I voted against Amendment 14. Since this Amendment to Article 6 of the report was passed, I along with the rest of my Irish colleagues in the EPP-ED decided to abstain on the final vote.
in writing. - (SV) Social security systems differ depending on where you are in Europe. This is not a problem, as many seem to think. Instead, it is a natural result of the fact that the countries are different and public democratic elections have resulted in different political systems being voted through. As advocates of intergovernmental EU cooperation, it is therefore natural for us to reject the wordings in both the Commission's proposal for a directive and the report from the European Parliament which seek to give the EU more power over the national social security systems.
The amended rules of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, adopted today, are intended to allow this Fund to intervene more effectively in terms of cofinancing the training and job placement of workers made redundant as a result of the economic crisis. The new rules extend the scope of the Fund and provide for a temporary increase in the cofinancing rate from 50% to 65%, in order to provide additional support from the Fund during the financial and economic crisis. However, countries facing financial difficulties will have little recourse to the Fund, given that they will still have to support a high rate of cofinancing.
The economic recovery plan is allocating EUR 200 million to the construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline which will transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea region to the EU. Romania supports this project. The key items of interest to Romania include funding in this recovery plan for gas interconnection projects between Romania and Hungary (EUR 30 million) and Romania and Bulgaria (EUR 10 million), as well as for developing the equipment infrastructure enabling the gas flow to be reversed in the event of short-term disruption to the supply (EUR 80 million).
The Commission's ambition to increase investments in energy infrastructure is the latest in a long line of examples of the arrogance that has infected the officials in Berlaymont. The proposed investments are both extensive and costly, and it has yet to be demonstrated that all of these investments should be dealt with at EU level. In total, investments amounting to EUR 3.5 billion are proposed for 2009 and 2010 - money that is to be provided from the Member States' budgets. As far as Sweden is concerned, this will mean a significant increase in the membership fees by an additional SEK 1.4 billion. The fact that the Commission does not believe it has had time to carry out a thorough impact assessment of such a comprehensive proposal is utterly appalling.
in writing. - (SV) The proposal to set aside around EUR 4 billion for projects in the field of energy within the European energy programme for recovery is a good one. However, the content has become far too focussed on fossil fuels. In addition, there is a complete lack of support for projects for improving the efficiency of energy use. At an early stage, the Commission proposed that EUR 500 million be set aside for 'sustainable cities' - a proposal that was, however, withdrawn.
First, the retention for the securitisation of loans is an important and correct instrument for involving financial institutions in the business risk of the loans in question. However, this requires a significantly large retention. The 5% retention agreed in the trialogue does not meet this requirement. The European Commission originally called for a 15% retention in the consultation process but then bowed to pressure from industry and proposed 5%. Conservatives and liberals in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wanted to declare even this low-level participation in the business risk unnecessary through the submission of a guarantee by the financial institutions. The SPD Members of the European Parliament support a much higher retention and will also emphasise this demand in future reforms of the Capital Requirements Directive.
Second, the definition of core capital given in the Karas report violates the competitive neutrality of the regulation. It provides that, in future, silent capital contributions will no longer fully count as core capital, although they can be fully absorbed in the event of liquidity. This opens the floodgates to unfair competition against public banks in Germany. We note that silent capital contributions are a proven refinancing instrument, which is compatible with EU law. As the outcome of the trialogue does take account of the explanatory amendments we have proposed, we reject the report.
Supervision of the financial institutions within the EU is not a task for the EU at the present time. It is important to bear this in mind. However, the present proposal gives an indication of the ambitions of the powerful political elite. With vague references to the financial crisis and its conceivable consequences for supervision and scrutiny, this is nothing more than a brazen attempt to advance the EU's position. We, of course, have no choice but to vote against the report and the alternative motion for a resolution.
Ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the Wojciechowski report on the protection of animals at the time of killing. Many people wonder how it is possible to protect animals while they are being killed. This may sound paradoxical, but it is possible. Everyone who has experienced the killing of an animal or observed such an act is aware of how painful the death of an animal may be. Introduction of new legislation in this area will limit the unnecessary suffering of animals, and this is why the legislation is needed.
Legal recognition of such a practice is part of a much wider phenomenon, that of the Islamisation of our societies. Our laws and customs are changing progressively to accommodate Islamic Sharia law. In France, more and more local authorities are indirectly funding the construction of mosques. School menus are drawn up to meet Islamic dietary requirements. In some cities, such as Lille, the swimming pools have womenonly sessions. By creating the Conseil français du culte musulman in 2003, Mr Sarkozy, then Minister of the Interior, introduced Islam into France's institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that the European Parliament should have chosen a schizophrenic approach at the end of its term and on such a sensitive issue, because it really is schizophrenic, on the one hand, to project oneself into the future even when the latter introduces technologies used to teach violence and rape and, on the other, to plunge back into the past in order to return to tribal rites and to placate those who need to see blood spilt and more pointless suffering in the eyes of the victim.
However, the report also contains requirements for minimum wage systems. We Social Democrats believe that it is important for everyone to be guaranteed a decent wage that it is possible to live on, and we think that the EU should encourage this. This is particularly important to enable us to deal with the problem of the 'working poor'. How Member States then choose to guarantee their citizens a decent wage and whether they do this by means of legislation or by leaving it to the social partners to regulate via collective agreements must continue to be decided by the Member States themselves.
This report contains many contradictions. However, in essence, it insists on the existing guidelines of neoliberal capitalism, albeit mitigated here and there, but without altering the basic policies which are at the root of the current economic and social crisis. The guiding principle is the same as always. The 'crisis' is now being used to once again 'sell' the recipe of 'more of the same': flexibility, internal market, public-private partnerships, and so on, ignoring the fact that the EU's policies are also at the root of the crisis and have made it worse.
You urge citizens to be 'open to change' when, for workers, change equals losing their jobs and the certainty that they will not find new ones, thanks to your policies. You speak of 'social' whilst the Court of Justice tramples over workers' rights in the name of competition and the freedom to provide services. You add in flexibility, when this is merely Eurospeak for 'insecurity'. You even pretend to pay special attention to women and mothers, when your idiotic 'gender' policy results in the loss of their specific social rights, such as the ones they used to have in France in the areas of retirement and night work.
However, the report also contains requirements for minimum wage systems. We Social Democrats believe that it is important for everyone to be guaranteed a decent wage that it is possible to live on, and we think that the EU should encourage this. This is particularly important to enable us to deal with the problem of the 'working poor'. How Member States then choose to guarantee their citizens a decent wage and whether they do this by means of legislation or by leaving it to the social partners to regulate via collective agreements must continue to be decided by the Member States themselves.
in writing. - The EPP-ED Group is generally supportive of the thrust of the original report by Jean Lambert. However, in committee another political group injected extraneous points into the report which were not only outside the intended scope of the report but which were known to be unacceptable to our group. They did this deliberately, for shabby party-political reasons, to make it impossible for us to support the report as presented to plenary. We have therefore tabled an alternative resolution which contains all the elements of her report which we do support.
The fact that the EU even needs to ask itself this question demonstrates one of the fundamental problems with Brussels. Far too much attention is given to job protection and not nearly enough to job creation. The European social model is primarily responsible for the fact that so many Europeans are unemployed. The European social model does exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to: it creates a two-tier labour market economy, bringing benefits for those in work and limiting the possibility of those without a job to get one. The social cost of endless EU regulation is also huge, dissuading employers from taking on new workers. So much for the EU's vaunted plan to be the world's most competitive economy by 2010.
The preparatory process leading to the conference was particularly complex, with a significant number of countries having serious misgivings about the process in the light of what happened in 2001. Because of their concerns that the conference would be used as a platform for expressions of hatred and intolerance in its most extreme form, several Member States, including my own, decided to withdraw from the conference. These concerns were confirmed by the intervention of one member of the UN at the very beginning of the conference. Not only did we find this totally unacceptable, but it was directly contrary to the very spirit and purpose of the conference.
It is unfortunate, although perhaps inevitable, that this incident and the subsequent walk-out of all Member States as well as other UN members, made the news headlines, overshadowing the consensual adoption of the outcome document. At the same time, I think that the very constructive and solid EU contribution through the preparatory phase of the conference should be fully acknowledged. This was particularly the case in relation to the drafting of the outcome document, in which the EU played a critical role. Despite the distractions to which I have referred, the fact that the final outcome document of the conference respects all the EU red lines represents a considerable achievement.
Whilst there are signs that the EU's anti-discrimination legislation is having a positive impact, the overall global progress in the fight against these phenomena remains regrettably slow. In fact the trend in a number of countries is even negative. We have seen cases where the current economic crisis is starting to fuel racist and xenophobic intolerance across the world. Against the background of the economic crisis, strong anti-racism policies are more important than ever. Both within Europe and more widely, we are facing an upsurge in violent attacks targeting migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, as well as minorities such as the Roma.
Internally, we have adopted legislation prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination, on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, at work, education and with regard to access to goods and services. Legislation also prohibits discrimination on other grounds, including religion, age, sexual orientation and disabilities, particularly in the workplace. The EU has also adopted legislation to ban hate speech from TV channels, as well as to criminalise 'publicly inciting to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin'. The same piece of legislation makes it a crime to publicly condone, deny or grossly trivialise crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
Externally the EU regularly raises racism and xenophobia issues in its bilateral political and human rights dialogues with third countries such as Russia and China. We have also ensured that racism and xenophobia are mainstreamed into our cooperation strategies such as the European neighbourhood policy action plans. Much is happening within various multilateral fora. Within the OSCE framework, Member States coordinate their work so as to ensure that the commitments made by the 56 OSCE participating states in this area are respected and implemented. This is also the case within the Council of Europe and within the wider UN framework.
These examples demonstrate our collective commitment to work on this issue both internally and more widely with partners worldwide. The Durban Review Conference was part of those wider efforts. It was not easy and quite clearly was marred by those who thought to deviate the results of the conference for their own narrow political ends. But for all that, we should welcome the fact that, in the end, it has focused attention both on the continuing need to tackle racism and xenophobia and on the commitment which we have, and which is shared by very many others, to eradicating this scourge.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Iranian President Ahmadinejad recently asserted at the UN Conference on Racism in Geneva that Israel is a racist country. It is tempting to dismiss him as a populist demagogue courting publicity, but he has in the past outrageously called for Israel to be wiped off the map, and Israel would undoubtedly be the first target for the nuclear weapon he so much wants to build. We should therefore see his intervention in the light of his implacable hostility towards the Jewish state, which is, quite rightly in my view, the EU's ally and strong partner.
Nothing would have been more symbolically significant than the collective exodus from the conference hall of all the EU countries in response to the provocative and unacceptable proposals made by an Iranian president who, despite the change of tone in Washington, insists on putting his country on a collision course with the West. Regrettably, some European countries were not even in the conference hall to express their displeasure at a speech whose sole objective, as underlined by the UN Secretary-General, was to accuse, divide and even incite.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I wish to begin by making a general remark. Countries are not racist: people are racist. There are many people in Iran, I am sure, who do not share the views of their President and I think it was in fact a missed opportunity that Europe was weak, silent, divided and absent and did not speak on behalf of those people in Iran and that it left the podium to the likes of Mr Ahmadinejad to speak his racist language.
I personally was against the boycott of the conference, but I think what was even worse is that there was no European strategy. Why was Europe divided? Why? I would like an explanation from the Council - and I have tabled an amendment to this effect to the Obiols i Germà report that we will be discussing later - why there was no European strategy? Why are 27 European countries unable to agree on a strategy? If and when the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, which is something that the Council has supported, then the 27 countries will have to make a stronger effort for a joint strategy.
Concerning the issue of the defamation of religion, I am extremely worried that it is a UN body that is able to adopt resolutions calling for a total ban on the defamation of religions or on offending religions. In the end, I understand that it has been watered down in the final resolution, but I still think it is worrying that something like this can come out of the UN. However, I also see the irony in the fact that in this House it is also still very difficult to even criticise - not offend, criticise - religions, and one main European religion in particular, and there is another amendment tabled by myself and my colleague Cappato to the Obiols i Germà report criticising the Vatican for its position on condoms in the fight against AIDS. Again, I would like to ask the Council to explain what has been done to get to a European strategy.
The EU will analyse, in the aftermath of Durban, how it will continue to support the Durban agenda. The fact that five Member States out of 27 decided in the end not to participate in the conference itself by no means puts into question the EU's commitment to the fight against racism and discrimination in the future. We have a solid acquis on these issues on which we will continue to build. As was rightly pointed out - and I take it as a kind of criticism - at the end of the preparations for the conference we were not really able to find a common ground. There was never any common ground, so there was never an EU position before the conference. It was decided by consensus that there were national positions, so the delegations left the room in their national capacities.
In this letter, Mrs Pillay recalled what she had already said in Brussels on 8 October, in a conference jointly organised by the European Parliament on the protection of human rights activists. Mrs Pillay considers that it is important to restore a certain unity in relation to the protection and promotion of human rights in the world, especially in terms of the fight against racism. She invites all the Member States of the United Nations to join in implementing the United Nations programme to combat racism, especially as it is defined in the final document from the Durban Conference.
I think that the European Union must reflect on the response to be given to this invitation. In any case, the European Union has adopted a policy of actively fighting racism. The Union must remain vigilant and committed so that international efforts on this issue can remain demonstrably effective. I personally share the view expressed here: a Europe with a strategy and which did not act in a disorganised manner would surely have been able to take real advantage of this opportunity to express, with one voice, its opposition to unacceptable statements. Let this be a lesson to us. I am grateful to the Presidency for having said that this should serve as a lesson and that - fortified, I trust, by the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon - we must be able to make the European Union's external human rights policy, and thus European action in multilateral bodies, more effective. I can only add my voice, on this issue, to the speeches made by a number of Members, to whom I am grateful. Once again, this must encourage us to reflect in order to prepare more effective strategies in the future.
the report by Mr Popa, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EC) No [.../...] [establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person] (recast) - C6-0475/2008 -, and
Current rules stipulate that 10% of the Fund's resources be allocated to these tasks. The Commission is proposing to us that this percentage be reduced to 4% and that the balance of the resources be transferred to the new Office. In this way, the Fund's financial allocation for the 2008-2013 period would be reduced from EUR 628 million to EUR 614 million. We agree with the Commission that these amounts are sufficient for the first phase of the Fund up until 2013, which is when a revision is scheduled.
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has seen fit to entrust to me the welcome task of arguing for the advisability of creating this Office. The proposal has been approved unanimously by the two committees concerned: the Committee on Civil Liberties and the Committee on Budgets. Although Parliament, as we know, is reluctant to see new agencies created, as a budgetary authority its principal concern is the correct, reasonable management of the resources allocated, in this case to ensure practical cooperation between the Member States on asylum.
This is my last speech in this plenary session. Like you, Madam President, I would also like to thank all the Members of this House, my group colleagues, the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties and my fellow Members on the committee for the collaboration we have enjoyed over the past years. We have had debates, and we have not always been in agreement, but I believe that in the end we have always produced good work to bring to the plenary session of this Parliament.
Madam President, when I first came here 22 years ago, I arrived at the European Economic Community with its 12 Member States. I am happy that what I am leaving now is a European Union with 27 members. It has been a true privilege to be in the very engine-house of European integration. It has been a unique, magnificent experience. Madam President, I also believe that one of the greatest successes has been to achieve the 'never again' which was at the root of the creation of European unification; I think that we can congratulate ourselves on this.
When the Return Directive was debated, it was made very clear that that piece of legislation would not apply to the future legislation on the reception of asylum seekers; fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats said the same thing. In my view it is vital for asylum seekers to be given information in a language that they understand. Restricting the provision of information to an asylum seeker to a language he understands or may be presumed to understand lowers the existing requirements and would not be acceptable, I believe, from a legal viewpoint or in terms of the interpretation of human rights. The right to be properly informed is fundamental, because it forms the basis of all other rights.
My proposal clarifies the second ground for detention (Article 8(2)(b)), placing it within the framework of a preliminary interview in accordance with the guidelines for detention laid down by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I also propose, in Article 9(5)(1), an ex officio review by the judicial authorities of the detention when there is a change of circumstances or fresh information becomes available, at the request of the asylum seeker or, as I was saying earlier, in the absence of that, automatically.
Finally, if the initial proposals for social benefits to immigrants are reduced, as other groups have achieved in the voting in committee, then I think it is necessary, even though we are currently in a period of crisis, to ensure effective access to the labour market. In this way, asylum seekers will gain independence, integrate into the host society and reduce the social expenditure allocated to them. I would also like to extend my warm thanks to Mr Barrot and his Commission for all the efforts he has made throughout the course of this directive.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, allow me, first of all, to make a few general remarks. I have been heavily involved in drafting European asylum and immigration policy over the past few years on behalf of my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. I am sure that virtually everyone can see the usefulness and necessity of such a policy. After all, what a Europe without internal borders is crying out for is a common approach in this field. Having said that, I would point out that the standards we have agreed on and the results we have achieved to date contrast greatly with the ambitions set out in the Tampere Programme, the Hague Programme and, most recently, the French Asylum and Immigration Pact.
The first stage involves collecting the fingerprints within 48 hours of submitting the application for asylum, while in the second stage, Member States send the data obtained in this way to the Eurodac central system within 24 hours. The report contains provisions allowing the 48-hour deadline to be extended in the following exceptional cases: when a quarantine period needs to be applied due to a severe contagious illness; when the prints are destroyed; as well as in cases of force majeure which are properly substantiated and proven, and for the period during which these circumstances prevail.
The report supports the idea of setting up as soon as possible a decentralised agency for managing Eurodac, VIS and SIS II to ensure that these systems operate as efficiently as possible. This management agency will draw up a common set of requirements which must be met by anyone authorised to have access to the Eurodac infrastructure and data. In addition, provisions have been introduced which are aimed at banning the provision of data input in the Eurodac system to the authorities of any unauthorised third country, especially the country of origin of the applicants for protection, in order to protect the members of the asylum seekers' families from the serious consequences to which they could be subject.
But what we want to see is this improvement, and part of what this is about is providing training. We are advocating that UNHCR guidelines should be involved in that - maybe the starting point, even if they do not lead - and that Member States should be able to draw on experience, that the office should be able to deliver joint training or, indeed, specific training to Member States as the need arises, drawing on expertise from within the Member States themselves but also from the UNHCR and, indeed, relevant NGOs.
We thought at one point we might have got a first-reading agreement on this, but time and, indeed, our desire to pull together the package of measures looking at the European common asylum system mean that we have not got that far. But we have had considerable discussions between the shadows and also with the Council on this, and this explains certain of the amendments before us at the moment, certain of which are technical in terms of bringing in things which are normally in the regulation, which were omitted in the original proposal.
However, the role of Parliament is proving a little more difficult to find agreement on with the Council. We are looking at Parliament being involved quite closely in the appointment of the director, looking at the Fundamental Rights Agency perhaps as our model on that. The other sticking point is, as Jeanine has indicated in her introduction on the Dublin system, the question about how much we can actually look at Member States cooperating, as it were, from a starting point which makes that obligatory rather than voluntary. So those are certainly the two big issues at the moment.
I heartily thank the five rapporteurs for their considerable and excellent work. This is the first time that Parliament has given its verdict, as colegislator, on asylum issues. It has to be said that a fruitful working relationship has just begun. I am pleased to see that Parliament largely supports the objectives in the Commission's proposals. This support is essential if we are to overcome certain shortcomings in the legislative instruments from the first phase. At the time, they were adopted merely after consultation of Parliament.
I would, however, like to comment on some of the proposed amendments, which are giving some cause for concern and are worthy of particular attention. I will first turn to Mr Popa. As regards Eurodac, I broadly agree with his proposals. Now let me turn to Mr Masip Hidalgo and talk about access to reception conditions. I will accept an amendment on the sensitive issue of the equivalence of the material support offered to asylum seekers and the minimum social assistance guaranteed to national citizens.
I would firstly like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, and also Parliament for introducing the option of suspending the transfers of asylum seekers when a Member State encounters difficulties. However, it is difficult to go further in the framework of the Dublin Regulation, as this regulation, Mrs HennisPlasschaert, cannot be an instrument as such for the distribution of asylum seekers among Member States. I have indeed heard your call for solidarity, and the Commission can accept an amendment in the preamble to the regulation, in order to give a political signal along the lines of creating improved, formal solidarity mechanisms.
In fact, I am determined to propose, at a later date, concrete instruments to increase solidarity at European Union level and to relieve the pressure on the asylum systems in some Member States. We need to arrive at a fairer distribution of the beneficiaries of international protection among Member States. The Union has already allowed the European Refugee Fund to support pilot projects in this area. Moreover, once it is operational, the support office will be able to give expert support to those Member States that request it. However, you have put your finger on the problem, namely the need for more solidarity and more consistency among the various Member States.
The Commission, moreover, believes that the office's external mandate should not be limited to resettlement activities and regional protection programmes. Amendments restricting the support office's mandate must be avoided. There are amendments with the aim of radically changing the procedure for appointing the director of the future office. Beware! The procedure proposed by these amendments could considerably delay the director's appointment. We do indeed need this office to be established quickly and effectively. The formula the Commission is proposing is the horizontal formula currently used for 20 regulatory agencies coming under the first pillar. We would find it regrettable to depart from a harmonised formula when horizontal discussion is conducted within the interinstitutional group on agencies, in which Parliament participates.
I shall conclude. I have already taken up quite a lot of time, but the work of Parliament is such that I wish to provide a detailed response. Some have criticised the proposals on Dublin and on reception conditions for being too generous. Some say: 'Yes, but this Europe of asylum will be a beacon for unfounded asylum requests.' Others, obviously, have invoked the principle of subsidiarity. Frankly, I do not share these criticisms. Only the true harmonisation of European asylum provisions around clear standards promoting fairness and effectiveness will enable Europe to put into practice its desire to protect those who actually need such protection, while avoiding abuses encouraged by ambiguous, unevenly applied standards. Experience shows that where Member States handle asylum requests in an objective, professional way, no beacon effect has been created, far from it. I believe there is no incompatibility between fighting against the abuse of procedures and raising the standards of protection.
The establishment of the European Asylum Support Office will facilitate the exchange of information, analysis and experience among Member States and will help to further develop practical cooperation between the administrations in charge of examining asylum applications. It will also use the shared knowledge of countries of origin to help to bring national practices, procedures and, consequently, decisions into line with one another. Both the Council and Parliament favour the establishment of such an office. The Presidency believes that the proposal can, and should, be the subject of an early agreement between Parliament and the Council on a basis acceptable to both institutions. As the honourable Members know, this proposal is accompanied by a proposal for modifying the European Refugee Fund. Since its purpose is to ensure its financing of the Support Office, both instruments should be adopted at the same time.
The Commission proposals in relation to the Reception Conditions Directive, as the honourable Members know, are intended to amend the existing directive with a view to addressing the deficiencies identified by the Commission during recent years. The Commission considers that the margin of discretion left to Member States by the Directive in force is too great, and that this has undermined the objective of ensuring adequate reception conditions for asylum seekers in all Member States. That is why the Commission has proposed a number of amendments concerning such matters as access to employment by asylum applicants, enhanced material reception conditions, better addressing of the needs of vulnerable persons and recourse to detention.
The Dublin Regulation, that is, the regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application, is intended to prevent abuse of asylum procedures in the form of multiple applications submitted by the same person in several Member States. The Commission is now proposing a number of amendments aimed at increasing the efficiency of the current system and also in order to ensure better protection standards for asylum applicants. The proposal also contains a mechanism for suspending transfers in cases when a Member State is experiencing particular pressure on its asylum system which does not allow it to offer asylum seekers adequate standards of protection and reception conditions.
The detailed examination of the Commission's proposals on reception and Dublin is ongoing in the Council. The Council has yet to define its position on a number of the issues dealt with in the two proposals, and a discussion is still ongoing on certain key issues. These include the question of access to employment and detention in the context of the Reception Conditions Directive, and how best to respond to the needs of Member States facing particular pressure in the context of the Dublin Regulation. It is already clear to the Presidency that more work will be necessary at the level of the Council in order to achieve the necessary level of agreement among Member States on these proposals, which would enable it to engage in discussions with Parliament with a view to an agreement between the two institutions. That, of course, remains our aim, and Parliament can be assured that the Council will fully take into account the views of Parliament as represented by amendments proposed in the relevant draft reports.
As my colleague Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert rightly said, and here, I wish to congratulate her, this package is built upon the principle of solidarity. Solidarity needs to go out to those who deserve protection but also, for the first time, solidarity with those countries bearing a disproportionate burden. This solidarity is being introduced upon agreement to the Commission's proposal to suspend the Dublin Regulation in the case of countries that are carrying a disproportionate burden. This same solidarity is also inherent in the European Parliament's proposal to introduce a burden-sharing mechanism which will no longer be voluntary but legally binding across the board.
Two boats heading towards Lampedusa, carrying 130 immigrants, are currently just off Lampedusa, however Italy is refusing to go out and rescue them. According to international law, these persons must be escorted to the nearest port, and as VicePresident Barrot said at the time of the first incident, the closest port of call in this case is that of Lampedusa. Mr President, Italy's behaviour, or rather, that of Italian Minister Maroni, is illegal in the face of international law, is overbearing with regard to Malta, and is inhumane with respect to all the immigrants involved. This kind of behaviour does not pay tribute to Italy, and this situation, Mr President, is also serious because it is sending out a dangerous message, implying that one should not rescue immigrants because if you do, the burden of keeping them will fall on your shoulders. This is an extremely dangerous message.
Therefore, I here turn to the Vice-President of the European Commission, Jacques Barrot, and ask him to intervene without delay in order to unblock this situation. I would also ask him to insist that Italy honours its international obligations, and I also ask him to make it clear to all Member States of the European Union that this is not simply an issue between Malta and Italy, but that it is everyone's responsibility and, consequently, should be borne by all of us.Mr President, if we refuse to show solidarity in practice then we will erode the trust that lies between us, and we will also eat away at the trust of all European citizens. If we truly believe in solidarity then we cannot allow national egoism to take over. Everyone has to play their part. Thank you.
The proposal contains several aspects that will certainly need to be reviewed in the near future. I am referring to the situation of asylum seekers, the cases in which they may be detained, the fundamental difference between the concepts of 'custody' and 'detention', the facilities in which they may be detained, the formulation of exceptions to transferral, the existence of exceptions to the general principle establishing which country is responsible for considering the application, the specific details of who forms part of the 'nuclear family', and the assistance that ought to be given to Member States having to deal with a greater weight of applications.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) As I have already indicated in my first address to the House, there are still enormous differences between the Member States and the desired harmonisation has, in fact, been a failure in this respect. We cannot deny that any longer. What directives provide for are a number of procedural standards, rather than for a standard procedure. Given the many differences which we are now trying to reconcile, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is quite clearly opting for a pragmatic approach.
We consider the establishment of a European Asylum Support Office and the carrying out of the proposed recast of the Reception Conditions Directive and the EURODAC Regulation to be crucial in this context. It is a pity, therefore, and I address this little aside to the Commission, that we still have to wait for the publication of both the recast procedure and the Recognition Directive. Their publication is scheduled for 24 June. However, from the point of view of greater coherence and better law-making, it would have been more logical if these two proposals had been added to the current asylum package.
The game being played in Malta is actually not very clear, and I will explain myself straight away. I would not like to call it a dirty game simply because of the respect that should be shown to a European Union Member State, but our fellow Member should have honestly stated that Malta has always sought to maintain its excessive expanse of territorial waters, which stretch as far as the island of Lampedusa. The Italian Government has asked Malta on many occasions to reduce its huge expanse of territorial waters. Malta prefers to keep it as it is so that it can keep its request for contributions from the European Union high as well.
Coming to the crux of this report, I would emphasise that it is our duty - instead of carrying on these disputes that resemble the cockfights in Manzoni's famous novel - it is the duty of our Member States not to give in to the siren calls of do-goodery, peppered perhaps with hypocrisy and very specific political and economic interests, but to force ourselves very strictly to apply the sacrosanct principle of asylum, and in so doing not to give up any ground to those who wish to use it for improper purposes that are not in accordance with the noble principles that inspire it, and to prevent its exploitation, which favours precisely those criminal organisations that organise and exploit the trade in illegal immigrants, to which we refer in the context of the current situation.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too am the shadow on this package and I would pick up on what Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra was saying about the moral duty here. Also, when we are talking about rigorous application, as mentioned by some Members, some of us are more concerned that the application of rules is actually fair and that it does not stop people in need of protection actually getting it. One of the points about this particular package is how we improve that and make sure that all Member States are operating to the same high standard.
Because of the events of 2005 and 2006, we have had to tackle illegal immigration, but in that process the asylum-seeker has literally fallen overboard. Although I am in favour of establishing an agency for cooperation, I do have some concerns about its form and mission. How do we get a reliable list of safe countries of origin? What sources are we going to use to produce such a list? How can we provide adequate protection for the sources of information that come from those countries which are not safe? Can such sources be publicly disclosed and how credible will such a list be to an independent judge? I should like to hear from the Council how we might avoid this problem.
Why is it that we have not delegated practical cooperation to Frontex? This agency's remit is limited and it would be very well-placed to tackle this task, if we increased its funding. That way, we would also be able to respond adequately to the actual facts on the ground, which Frontex is already facing, anyway. Based on our experience of asylum-seekers' and immigrants' illegal entry, we could then make proper arrangements for providing reception for asylum-seekers. To me, that seems a very practical solution.
Why? All asylum seekers should have fast access to the labour market. I take the view that it is a matter for the Member States to take this decision. What is being proposed is that the group of individuals allowed to file an application for asylum be extended to individuals with mental health problems - yes, I know many people with mental health problems, but not all of them have the right to asylum - or to all elderly people, for example. Indeterminate legal concepts are being used. Nor do I accept that all asylum seekers should be granted social assistance in the same way as own nationals. As this is not the case, approximately 95% are simply not granted asylum. What is being proposed with these amendments is, I believe, the wrong path to follow. I will therefore be voting against them together with the delegation of the Austrian People's Party.
On the Lambert report establishing a European Asylum Support Office, we believe this is a critical step forward in making cooperation between Member States relating to the common European asylum system a reality. The Socialist Group supports this report, but we have also tabled amendments. We want to see greater transparency and accountability, as I think the rapporteur is also striving to do. We want to see the appropriate involvement of the UNHCR and NGOs, and I have added amendments which bring forward good levels of European Parliament scrutiny in the system.
(PL) Mr President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights contain exhaustive information on rights of asylum. This is a fundamental right when there is persecution in a person's country of origin on the grounds of race, religion, ethnic origin, political opinion or membership of a particular political group, and this is fairly common in the world today. Giving people this right should also mean guaranteeing them the right to develop their lives. That must be a fundamental condition.
In order to achieve this, we should give people who have applied for asylum access to the job market, because this is the best way to enable the asylum seeker to be selfsufficient. This also prevents social isolation and helps the asylum seeker to get to know the culture of the host country better. People who have applied for asylum should be guaranteed access to the widest range of procedural assistance, and this includes the right to highquality legal help in order to make it easier for them to understand their rights.
(EL) Mr President, the Eurodac system is used to collect fingerprints from asylum seekers. Although we acknowledge that an attempt is being made to improve the previous operating framework of Eurodac, we still have doubts on two major issues: firstly, respect for the fundamental rights of the people coming to Europe for a better future in that, basically, these are 'Euro police records', with which we categorically disagree. Secondly, whether the measures being adopted are in keeping with the basic principles of the Union itself, such as, for example, personal data protection, and whether the measures provided for are in keeping with the principle of proportionality. We do not agree with the fingerprinting of children of 14 years of age.
Mr President, I wish to thank all the speakers and, in particular, to thank the rapporteurs once more. I will just make one or two remarks, concerning firstly the language issue, and addressed in particular to Mrs Lefrançois. I must say that the Commission considered that the proposal that asylum seekers must be informed in a language that they are likely to understand is balanced. The aim of this measure is to enable adequate information to be given to asylum seekers whilst making it possible to combat potential cases of abuse on the part of some asylum seekers.
I should like now to thank Parliament. However, you will allow me to express my surprise at Mr Pirker's speech, in particular. Mr Pirker, I cannot allow you to distort the Commission's proposal. When I hear you say that the Dublin revision could lead to a 'shopping' forum, I cannot allow it, it is not possible and it is not true. The Commission's proposal does not change the principles on which the Dublin system is based. Asylum seekers will not be able to choose the State of asylum, although it is true that the State responsible will be determined on the basis of objective criteria, but with account taken of more humane considerations, and of family reunification in particular.
I cannot believe that, as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, you are not mindful of this problem of family reunification. I cannot allow you to distort this proposal. For the Commission as well, it is a matter of establishing clear-cut guarantees in order to avoid abuse of the system. We have introduced, among other things, a mechanism to identify vulnerable persons. Obviously, the Member States must ensure the fair, balanced implementation of the principles that we have suggested.
I cannot believe that the European Parliament is unable to find broad agreement on the basis of the work completed by the rapporteurs. Of course, you belong to different political families with different political and philosophical sensibilities, but let us not forget that this Europe, which has witnessed persecution and sometimes the major risks that put the lives of the persecuted in danger, is not a model in this area. This is not about idealistic preaching; it is about being faithful to our values. I insist on this. I, personally, need very broad support from the European Parliament.
Let me say at the end of my remarks that further work is ahead of us in the area, as the Commission has already announced its intention to table further legislative proposals for the purpose of completing the common European asylum system. These proposals will concern asylum procedures and the standards for qualification and status for the qualification of applicants as refugees, as well as the establishment of resettlement schemes for people under the protection of the UNHCR. We need to make progress as quickly as possible, while ensuring that speed does not compromise quality. That is something on which I am confident we can all agree.
However, it is vital for us to be able to identify genuine asylum seekers, those whose application for political asylum is actually fully justified. By improving the registration system we can obviously resolve these cases much more quickly. At the same time, however, I would also like to discuss another problem which is to do with networks, more specifically, the criminal activities of the networks trafficking asylum seekers. These networks obtain huge sums of money from transporting asylum seekers to European Union Member States. I also think that combating this criminal activity must be a priority concern for us, and a strategy must be devised to tackle it.
I welcome the Commissioner's clarity about the different missions of the Asylum Support Office and Frontex. They are very different things with very different purposes, although of course the cooperation and the delivery are important within them. One of the aspects that has been touched upon has been that of information about third countries - the countries of origin of those seeking international protection. Of course this is one of the things that the Asylum Support Office will be looking at: how to pull together that information from a variety of sources in a more standard format and perhaps a format where people will have greater confidence that the information is not being used politically.
I think it is something of great wonder to many of us how one country will accept people from Chechnya as refugees with quite a high acceptance rate, whereas another country close by will not accept anybody from Chechnya. Many of us find this absolutely impossible to believe when the same information is out there. So confidence in the quality of information and the way in which it can then be used by Member States is also an extremely important part of the enhanced cooperation we will be seeing. We look forward to seeing this coming into being.
the report by Tadeusz Zwiefka, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in contractual and non-contractual obligations - C6-0001/2009 -
the report by Gérard Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries on judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations, and applicable law in matters relating to maintenance obligations - C6-0035/2009 -, and
The proposal for a regulation establishes a mechanism, on the basis of which Member States will be able to renegotiate, negotiate and conclude bilateral agreements with third countries in the area of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. An analogical mechanism is foreseen in relation to bilateral agreements in the area of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations. It is a response to the practical problem which arose in consequence of Opinion 1/03 of the European Court of Justice on the new Lugano Convention, in accordance with which the Communities are competent to conclude external agreements to the same extent that they used the mandate to accept legal means in the area of judicial cooperation in civil cases under Article 61(c) of the EC Treaty.
The proposed instrument establishes a special procedure. For this reason, the legal frameworks of the proposed mechanism must be strictly limited both in terms of scope and time. The first condition is met by limiting the proposed regulation to bilateral agreements in the areas of jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in civil and commercial matters. The second condition is met by the 'sunset clause', in accordance with which an agreement concluded under this procedure automatically loses force at the moment of conclusion of an agreement by the Communities with a third country.
Admittedly I do see the need to include in the legal frameworks the matter of performance of external competencies in the area which includes the specific law of contractual and non-contractual obligations, and also of matrimonial matters. However, it would seem to be necessary to make clear that the proposed mechanism will be applicable not only to sectoral agreements determined by the limited scope of this proposal, but also to other agreements such as bilateral understandings and regional agreements between a limited number of Member States and neighbouring third countries - of course only in very limited cases, concerning specific matters, and with the intention of resolving local problems.
I was sceptical as to the need to set the 'sunset clause' at 31 December 2014, if, according to the proposed regulation, the European Commission has to present a report on the application of the resolution by 1 January 2014. In addition, the process of negotiating agreements with third countries is often complicated and lengthy, and does not leave Member States much time to make use of the new procedure. Therefore the compromise proposal for the regulation to expire on 31 December 2019 allows a more complete and effective use of the procedure by Member States.
Despite the differing view of the European Commission, I am of the opinion that in its report on the application of the regulation the Commission should present the regulation in the context of other legislative instruments, such as Brussels I. The proposed mechanism, which includes a two-stage control function on the part of the Commission, will undoubtedly serve to ensure cohesion with the acquis. However, I have tried to achieve the greatest possible flexibility in the proposed procedure and a shortening of the times designated for the Commission to react, and also a reduction in the bureaucratic load. Democratic authorisation and the role of the European Parliament are not in any doubt, and therefore I also insist that the European Parliament and the Member States be given information at every stage, from the intention of a Member State to start negotiations with a third country through to conclusion of an agreement.
I would like to stress that the procedure for concluding bilateral agreements with third countries gives us a unique opportunity to demonstrate that the European Union is able to solve the problems of its citizens in their interest, which is particularly important in the context of the economic crisis and the growing Euroscepticism in many Member States. In conclusion, Mr President, in spite of certain differences of approach in a specifically legal sense we must show our pragmatism here, while of course respecting the acquis communautaire.
In essence, Mr President - and I agree on this - the problems that we are trying to solve with these two instruments are serious and very often really tragic. Each of us has heard of or knows cases where a marriage with a person from a third country has failed and where the father or more often the mother no longer has the right to see the children, who have been taken by the spouse to his or her country of origin or elsewhere, and sometimes is unable to discover their whereabouts. The same goes for the possibility of receiving maintenance payments.
What, though, is the origin of the issue that we are concerned with today? Why is it that the European institutions have to deal with this problem? The answer is simple. For all of these matters, the negotiation and conclusion of agreements with one or more third countries falls within the exclusive competence of the Community. The exclusively Community nature of these matters is explicitly confirmed by rulings from the Court of Justice and the opinions of the legal services. This means that what appeared to be very simple is, in fact, a little more complicated and more sensitive. So the question now is this: is it legally possible, given the current state of the Treaties and the case-law of the Court, to allow the Member States to exercise one of the Community's exclusive competences and, if so, under what conditions?
It is these very precise and restrictive legal principles that formed the basis of the amendments I tabled, and of the negotiations in which I took part, which were held in trialogue with the Council and the Commission. I am, I repeat, very aware of the tragedies suffered by some of our fellow citizens and I am determined to make great efforts to help them. That is why, in the end, I agreed to the compromise negotiated with the Council and the Commission, but I wish to make it very clear, Mr President, Commissioner, that the Community's exclusive competence must remain as such. The Member States must not, by granting countless derogations and broadening the scope, end up reclaiming what is an exclusive Community competence. That is the line that I have taken and, in the future, that is the line that I will defend.
When it comes to training, we must certainly not overlook the considerable steps forward, made in particular due to the training contribution offered by the European Judicial Training Network. In my opinion, we nevertheless need to go beyond the current training model based mainly on national postgraduate schools in order to build a stronger common judicial culture, which is still lacking. For this reason, I highlighted the need to move towards a well-organised European training institute for judges and lawyers, with adequate resources, yet referred to the need to avoid pointless duplication between existing facilities and highlighted the important role of national schools.
Secondly: we need a more effective all-round assessment mechanism of justice, of judicial authorities and of the implementation of European Union directives. The report therefore proposes setting up a group of experts to permanently monitor the application of Community law and the quality and effectiveness of justice, on the model of the Schengen mutual evaluation system. Its purpose is also to identify any weaknesses in the system and legislative shortcomings in the matter of criminal judicial cooperation in order to provide the European legislator with all the information resources required for a proper political and regulatory assessment.
I believe that we are in full agreement on this matter. That said, it is also the case that this flexibility will allow the Member States to enjoy, where the Community does not exercise its competence, an institutional framework to help citizens gain access to justice in third countries, especially in the area of family rights. It is true, too - Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez alluded to this - that we must think about the rules relating to divorce, the custody of children, access rights and maintenance obligations, and about the painful situations that can arise for want of legislation that is universally applicable to these areas, at international level.
The report also deals with the issues faced in implementing the principle of mutual recognition, and it is true that the transposition and the full and consistent application of the many existing instruments that are based on the principle of mutual recognition must be monitored. It is also true, though, that there can be no mutual recognition unless the mutual trust between Member States' legal authorities increases. That really is the main ingredient of mutual recognition. I am therefore grateful to the European Parliament for advocating the creation of a truly common judicial culture, as you have just said, Mrs Pagano.
The procedure established by the two proposals will apply primarily to the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between a Member State and third countries. It will in certain cases, however, also apply to the negotiation and conclusion of regional agreements between more than one Member State and/or more than one third country. As far as regional agreements are concerned, the procedure established by the proposal in the area of the family law will apply to the amendment or renegotiation of two already-existing conventions between the Nordic States. In the proposal in the area of applicable law, only a few regional arrangements will in fact fall within its scope. These could cover, for example, the operation of an airport situated in a border area, waterways common to two or more countries, or cross-border bridges and tunnels.
Within the context of this series of mutual evaluations, experts have also been studying the issues related to interaction between, on the one hand, the European arrest warrant, and, more generally, the principle of mutual recognition, and, on the other hand, the proportionality principle. However, the proportionality principle also has to be balanced with another principle, which is equally dear to Parliament - namely that of subsidiarity. The reality is that judicial authorities in various Member States have differing views on what constitutes a serious offence.
Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, it is certainly not on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but more so on behalf of my group that I would like to take advantage of this brief moment to express my extraordinarily positive reaction to Mrs Pagano's report. Congratulations on your report, Mrs Pagano. I believe that, in writing this report, you have drawn up an extraordinarily detailed list of items that should figure prominently, Commissioner, in the Stockholm Programme, which I know the Commission is actively preparing.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) The national boundaries drawn after the Second World War divided communities and families. I would like to tell you about an example of this close to us here in Europe. Szelmenc was at one time part of Hungary. However, one part of it, Nagyszelmenc, is currently located on the territory of a European Union Member State, Slovakia, while the other part, Kisszelmenc, is in Ukraine.
The draft regulation provides a procedure on the jurisdiction to be applied between Member States and third countries in relation to matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations. The regulation will not supersede Community laws, but is only to be applied when the relevant Member State demonstrates that there is a specific interest based on economic, geographical, cultural or historical relations, especially between the Member State and the third country in question, in signing a bilateral sectoral agreement with the third country. At the same time, the Commission states that the proposed agreement only has a limited influence on the uniform and consistent application of existing Community regulations and on the operation of the system implemented on the basis of the regulations mentioned.
Having established this - this is an exceptional procedure - I believe that the amendments that we have debated and tabled, and which I believe will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow, will make it possible to adopt this package of measures at first reading. I also hope, however, that on the part of the Commission, in the next stage and going forward, we can progress with the development of a real European system of private law. This is becoming increasingly necessary, as pointed out, for example, by Mr Sógor in the previous speech. We are talking about problems that affect people most directly and, to the extent that we are able to resolve their problems, people will realise that the European Union has a function.
The European arrest warrant - as others have said - and the whole of criminal justice is based on mutual trust. So the Member States must show they deserve that trust by having high-quality legal systems and respecting, for instance, the European Convention on Human Rights and Strasbourg court judgements. We cannot have people returned, via European arrest warrants, to an EU country who are then sent back to a third country for torture. If defiance of Strasbourg happens, then the fundamental rights safeguards in the European arrest warrant must be invoked. I think EU governments have ducked the challenge of tackling substantive disparities in legal systems and the patchy respect for fair trial and human rights.
We must also try and ensure that the quality of criminal justice legislation is better in the future. Hopefully, after Lisbon - I am delighted the Czech Senate has ratified the Lisbon Treaty - we will have fewer press launches of Member State proposals which go nowhere and then, even if they are approved, are never properly implemented. EU-wide justice and high legal standards are crucial for our citizens when they travel, work and set up businesses in other countries and when people have to try and explain themselves in a foreign language. It is high time that we made sure that anyone caught up in the criminal justice system of another Member State was made aware of their rights and obtained proper legal assistance, interpretation and translation.
Lastly, I must honestly say that I have some doubts about Mrs Pagano's European Parliament recommendation. I am grateful to her for having pointed out and supported the use of e-justice, all the more so because I was responsible for drawing up the report, and I still owe a debt of gratitude to those who co-operated to ensure its success. However, my awareness of subjects concerning the fundamental freedoms of victims, and also of suspects and defendants, as well as the need to implement the judicial training of judges and operators, lead me to remark that we still have a long way to go in this area - at least we certainly do in Italy. Furthermore, when it comes to the European arrest warrant, frankly my doubts turn into outright opposition. I nevertheless thank the rapporteurs for having worked on these subjects with skill and precision.
(EL) Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the three rapporteurs, Mr Zwiefka, Mr Deprez and Mrs Pagano. Ι should like in particular to congratulate Mrs Pagano on her report as shadow rapporteur and to thank her for her kind words and, at the same time, to thank her for working in close cooperation with me on the report. I should also like to express my satisfaction at the fact that, according to the Commissioner, the Commission accepts almost all the points included in this report. As such, I fully endorse Mrs Pagano's report and, of course, everything she said in the House today.
Commissioner, even this proposal on minimum procedural safeguards has not been pushed forward and our request - and these words are also directed at the Council - is that you push it forward. I shall close by saying that there are, of course, differences between judicial systems, but there is also room for convergence. That is why the recommendation on the creation of a committee of wise persons to study all the differences and similarities in the law needs to be implemented, so that we have specific expert recommendations on the convergence of our laws and mutual trust in judicial systems.
Mr President, when we began this work we were aware that we were walking on thin ice. On the one hand there was the exceptional nature and unusual importance of the legal instruments upon which we were working. On the other hand there was an awareness of the passing of time and the unavoidable approach of the end of this term of the European Parliament, and thirdly and finally there was an expectation, both from the Member States and from the citizens of the European Union, that at least at some precisely specified time there would be help available for them to resolve matters which are for them so very difficult and at the same time so important.
Therefore I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to Mr Deprez for his strenuous efforts at stopping us from crossing certain barriers. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Kohout for the unusually dynamic work of the representatives of the Czech Presidency, and to Commissioner Barrot for the truly perfect cooperation of the representatives of the Commission. I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who have spoken here today and who throughout the period of our work contributed to its final success, and also our coworkers, especially all the staff of the Committee on Legal Affairs, who put a truly huge amount of heart and hard work into the final success.
Mr President, I will not need two minutes. I believe - in response to what I took to be a call from the Council and a wish of Mr Zwiefka - that, as we have worked well together, so far as it depends on me, we will have an agreement at first reading tomorrow. Therefore in the voting instructions that I shall give to my political friends, I will advise them to vote for the text of the agreement that we have negotiated with the Council and the Commission, irrespective, I might add, of my personal feelings and of the improvements that I would have liked to have made to this text.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Council for supporting the principles and, above all, if he will allow me, Commissioner Barrot, with whom I have had very profitable exchanges that have been extremely useful in the work that we have subsequently brought to the Chamber. I would also like warmly to thank those Members who worked on this report, giving me ideas and, of course, bringing all their experience to bear, first and foremost Mr Demetriou, Mrs Ludford and the excellent Mr Deprez.
I wanted to say that Mr Demetriou, Mrs Ludford and Mr Deprez hit the nail on the head; they identified the challenge faced by the European Union, because achieving a collective European judicial culture - which of course means seriously combating the factors mentioned by Mr Deprez - establishing the independence of the judiciary, providing guarantees and ironing out the disparities between the various judicial systems are the challenges that await us. I nevertheless believe that the work we have done allows us to be optimistic.
I would like to say to Mr Romagnoli - I say this from my own point of view, which ought to be his too - that, essentially, because of the way in which the situation is viewed, there definitely is pessimism in Italy, but we must be willing to be optimistic, and the work that you too, Mr Romagnoli, have done and the contribution that you have made to the report means that, together, we can build the European Union, and the European Union is a reality for we Italians as well.
MEDIA Mundus will start in 2011 and will follow on from MEDIA International. It aims at strengthening cultural and commercial relations between European film industry professionals and those from all over the world. The concept of MEDIA Mundus is new, ambitious and innovative, because it promotes cooperation between professionals, which is not done normally by European programmes, and, unlike existing programmes, it is also based on mutual benefit, not only for our film-makers but also for film-makers from third countries, in different fields. The first one is training, including trainees and trainers from European and third countries. It will improve access to third-country markets and build trust and long-term commercial relationships: this is normal. When you have been sitting together at school, training for the film industry, with somebody from Asia, somebody from Africa or from the Americas, it is clear that, later on in your professional life, you have an impetus to work together.
I am very confident that MEDIA Mundus will increase consumer choice, so that people will have the possibility to watch European films. It will bring cultural diversity to European markets by getting more quality films from smaller markets outside Europe into Europe, and it will give a chance to European films on the international market. So it will create new business opportunities for professionals from Europe and around the globe. This is, of course, a very important economic contribution. It is a question of competitiveness, but it is most of all a question of cultural diversity - our cultural diversity - which is our most precious good, and the cultural diversity of those who live in other continents, which is their most special good. To share those is a wonderful chance, which will be built up by MEDIA Mundus.
We have learned a great deal from the Erasmus Mundus project, which opened the door for our students wishing to go to third countries and vice versa. In the context of globalisation, this is actually necessary, and MEDIA Mundus goes in the same direction with regard to film-makers. It is a wonderful example of how one can organise an intercultural dialogue in this field, which has a commercial aspect of course, but which is also, and above all, a cultural dialogue.
With MEDIA Mundus we of course strengthen the mobility of our films, film-makers and students and, in the end, what Wim Wenders keeps reminding us to do happens, namely we give Europe a new face, we turn the European dream into reality. The American dream has been conveyed to us through films for decades, and this is still the case today. If we eventually go so far as to bring the European dream to the world in cooperation with third countries, through images, we will have done much more to stabilise the European Union than we could have done in many other ways.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Hieronymi, I should like to extend my sincere congratulations on this report. All of us on the Committee on Culture and Education can be pleased and proud of what we have accomplished in such a short time. We have demonstrated that we can work flexibly and that we are not bound by procedure but pay due regard to the concerns of those who work in the film industry and who are urgently waiting for this policy to be successfully concluded. We have speeded up our work and we will still be able to work after the policy has been adopted and the resolution has been passed. We have not insisted on a reading. Those who constantly criticise our work and malign the positive things we have done should bear this in mind.
I am pleased that, in the year of creativity and innovation, we are helping the creative to be more innovative and enabling them to further their training and become more globally integrated. In the digital world, everything changes day by day, technology is different and there are new resources and new challenges. It is therefore necessary to create another network. This needs the financial support we are giving. If we want to further the growth of our European film industry and promote the idea of Europe, we not only need better quality, which is already very good but could be even better, but we must also give our creative artists financial assistance.
As far as cross-border cooperation and dissemination in third countries are concerned, I should like to give an example. For me, Slumdog Millionaire is an example of success. This film, which went around the world, was supported by the MEDIA Mundus programme to the tune of EUR 830 000 and became a global success; it made us more aware of an emergency situation in a particular country. However it also showed what it means when we cooperate on a cross-border basis. That is why I think this programme is an excellent programme and I am pleased that we completed it without any problems in such a short time.
This subject, however, leads us to reflect on something else. I am thinking about Europe's cultural influence in the world - that influence seems to be getting smaller, and this worries me greatly. I notice, too, that our continent does not participate in intercultural dialogue as an equal partner. The Christian traditions which shaped Europe are generally being questioned today, and it seems that Europe does not have another conception of its own identity. Therefore it is no surprise that it is losing. Europe's small share in the worldwide circulation of audiovisual works is a significant example of this.
Mrs Pack was quite right when she said, using a sentence of Wim Wenders, that we need European images to tell European stories, to express the diversity of European history and of European sensibilities. What was the tragedy of European history, and what are the great hopes of a peaceful and better future? That is the basic cultural understanding of the European Union, which we not only want to cultivate internally but also need to convey to the outside world. That is why European culture policy, and film policy in particular, is always an ambassador for European identity. That is why I am pleased that we have succeeded in getting this programme off the ground.
I should like to say from the outset that, in the next parliamentary term, this programme must be extended, invigorated and injected with more finances, so that the MEDIA Mundus programme can really fulfil its role of making it clear, in international cooperation, what European values are and what European cultural diversity is. There must also be co-productions, collaboration, training in the best sense of the word, a win-win situation which enriches both sides. In this age of globalisation and digitalisation it will be the trademark of European policy on culture.
Today, I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Hieronymi for her very good cooperation and for succeeding in making it clear in this House that, while culture has an economic side, it is always more than just a commodity. It is really about identity, diversity, cultural confrontation - in the best sense of the word. Because that is what moves people in their hearts and minds. Placing more trust in Europe than hitherto must be our obligation for the future. For that reason, Mrs Hieronymi, I extend my sincerest thanks for your good cooperation and wish you all the best for the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mrs Hieronymi for her excellent work and wish her many more years of success. The development of the international audiovisual environment deserves our attention because this is an interesting field of activity and it opens up a large space for cooperation within the European Union and also with other countries in the world. A further deepening of this cooperation, including the EUR 15 million budget for MEDIA 2011-2013, will broaden the choice for consumers and will bring more culturally diverse products into the European and international market. At the same time it will aid mutual understanding between peoples with different cultural traditions. Other very valuable aspects of these EU projects include the ongoing training courses for professionals in the audiovisual field, the varied promotional activities focusing on cinema, and the opportunities for increased circulation of films. It is also obvious that the audiovisual field is primarily the domain of the younger generation, who use television and devices operating via Internet protocols and multichannel digital television as one of their basic sources of information, together with other Internet technologies. The support of these systems through the EU project may therefore help to improve the quality of service for these users.
In this context I would, however, like to emphasise something else which I consider to be of key importance. All the Internet media represent an unrestricted alternative to traditional means of communication. Unfortunately, even in democratic societies, these traditional means of communication often fail because of commercial interests or because their management belongs to a particular political milieu and indirectly obliges employees to practice self-censorship. Because of this, much information reaches its audience in distorted or selective form. In contrast, the huge spread of the Internet, and the films and information which it disseminates, offers a genuinely independent, pluralistic media environment free of monopolies and cartels. We therefore need to support all projects which strengthen this alternative to the mainstream media world, and I am glad the Czech Presidency has contributed towards the successful accomplishment of the MEDIA Mundus project.
(SL) With the MEDIA Mundus programme, we are on the right path to promoting European film and European knowledge more effectively. Film is a medium which enables us to record, preserve, portray and sell Europe's cultural diversity. However, given the rapid pace of development of modern technologies, we also need continuous education and training. It would be a pity if some third countries or less-developed continents were to stop making films depicting their people's lives, interesting stories about them, and, of course, their own natural and cultural heritage and history, just because they lag behind in development and lack knowledge.
Because of the dominance of US film, which commands a huge market, European film has a tougher job competing in the world market, despite the fact that it has far more qualities than many a US tear-jerker or blockbuster. This is why MEDIA Mundus is a good platform for forging contacts with film-makers and distributors in third countries and for exchanging film-related knowledge and information. By the same token, in this field, the European Union fulfils the function of bringing different continents together and uniting film-goers from various countries, as well.
We will be gaining a new, successful programme, but losing our rapporteur and an expert in this field. I should like to pay my personal compliments to you, Mrs Hieronymi, for all the work you have done, for the breadth of your vision and for your cooperation. When I entered Parliament as a new member five years ago, Mrs Hieronymi was the first person I turned to for advice and information, and she was always prepared to offer help and understanding. So, once again, allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to you and wish you happiness in your family life, and in your professional life, because I know that you will not be putting your feet up in the future.
Some of you know that you will be coming back. I would like to come back, too, but I do not know whether or not that will happen. Allow me, therefore, to express my thanks, here and now, to all the members of the Committee, the Bureau and Parliament for giving me the opportunity to work on the Committee on Culture and Education. It has been enjoyable and pleasant working for you. Regardless of our political affiliations, we have worked to benefit culture, education, young people and sportsmen and -women. Furthermore, despite the fact that I come from a small country, my ideas have been taken up by the Committee and were later also confirmed by Parliament. Thank you for your cooperation.
It is my conviction, and we should be in no doubt, that the Commission is capable of managing the budget so that this has the greatest impact possible and does not fade away into separate projects. As a prestigious professor said, the MEDIA Mundus programme for audiovisual cooperation with third countries is proof that the international audiovisual landscape has changed considerably, particularly in technological terms. This initiative aims to develop opportunities for cooperation in the audiovisual market, boosting research and training as well as financing coproduction projects in order to boost cooperation between audiovisual professionals.
In fact, this programme is rooted in a policy. It was created under the MEDIA International action which, since 2007, has focused on the development of the European Union's relations with the audiovisual markets of third countries. The aim of this action was to meet the immediate needs of third countries and to improve the overall effectiveness of MEDIA 2007. It was important to address the new problems and challenges resulting from the globalisation of markets, which affects the European audiovisual sector.
This preparatory action thus paved the way for a European Union programme of extended aid promoting global cooperation in the audiovisual industry. Then, very quickly, the European Commission - which I congratulate - adopted a proposal to establish the MEDIA Mundus programme. With a budget of EUR 15 million for the period 2011-2013, the programme will offer new possibilities for international cooperation and networking - and this concept of networking is extremely important - among audiovisual professionals from the European Union and from third countries. Audiovisual media are very popular among young people. They make a huge contribution to the promotion of cultural dialogue, and the task, here too, is to establish new global balances in this sector between the United States and between other continents, which are major producers, and Europe, which has its rightful place.
We support the European Commission's proposal, as it means that this consensual programme that we have arrived at can be implemented. I am full of hope for this text; I endorse it because it is in keeping with my firmly held beliefs about respect, about intercultural dialogue, and about providing support for creative work, for training and for the audiovisual industry, and I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Hieronymi. I know that, in the next parliamentary term, we will owe it to her to continue to work along these lines.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal on the MEDIA Mundus programme is welcomed by everyone who wants to see the European audiovisual sector grow, become stronger and more competitive and export to the rest of the world. The European audiovisual industry has developed and improved considerably over recent years and its international profile has changed over the last 20 years, especially as a result of technological progress. This has resulted in intense economic development and investment and, as a result, an increased demand for audiovisual material on certain markets. Unfortunately, however, there are obstacles which affect the marketing of European works abroad, including inadequate funding for European audiovisual companies.
Community support for the audiovisual sector takes account of the fact that the European Union and its Member States promote cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the cultural sector, because it underlines the importance of respect for different cultural dimensions, so as to promote diversity and, finally, because the distribution sector determines the diversity of audiovisual works and consumer choices. There are still few European audiovisual works available on the international market, while audiovisual works from third countries, excluding US works, face similar problems of limited availability on the European markets. European distributors are basically small companies with limited means of obtaining access to international markets. Consequently, the new programme makes funds available so that measures can be taken to improve the distribution, marketing and promotion of European audiovisual works in third countries and, by extension, of third countries in Europe.
Commissioner, you have succeeded once again in completing this project; it is an important project, but it must be weighed against the importance given to it, and it certainly does not match your ambitions in terms of financing. Provision will therefore have to be made, for the next financial perspective, to increase the resources for this programme. These people, who travel, must be granted every available possibility and freedom, and it is in this connection that we still too often run into unresolved problems concerning visas, social security and artistic status. Much still remains to be done to make artists truly mobile.
(PL) Mr President, films from third countries are fairly often distributed in Poland. They are rarely of high quality, and meanwhile it is much more difficult for our European films to reach third country markets and viewers. In the meantime it is extremely important to support the spread of our culture. It is essential to promote European films in other countries. It is essential to ensure a better position for these films in third-country markets. In addition, strengthening the film industry will also ensure that the films produced are of higher quality. That will also be a significant value.
We have developed 11 training partnerships with Latin America, India, Canada, Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia covering films, TV shows, animation, documentaries. For example, a cartoon connection between the EU and Latin America and Canada for training and developing a cartoon specialist. For instance Prime Exchange, a workshop for authors and producers from India and Europe, to understand better the financing and the marketing elements of films. And the promotion on the distribution has been done, for instance, by the European Producers Club, which organised co-producing workshops in China and in India.
Dolma organised a documentary month in Chile, the Paris Project made co-produced productions between Japan and South Korea and Europe, and EuropaCinema has included a network of 230 European cinemas and 148 cinemas in the rest of the world, in order to exchange films between them. So here we can see very concrete action. It is not about big words but about deeds, in order to help the professionals to do themselves what they can best do: that is, to make films, to show films, to make films travel. Thanks to all those who have helped this to become a reality.
Anyone who deplores the lack of or insufficient European culture in the world, which they have every reason to do, can only welcome the MEDIA Mundus programme and vote in favour of it enthusiastically. It is an excellent example of how we can bring our cultural message to the world. That is why I would earnestly request that you convey this message to our governments with vigour. Promoting European culture collaboratively does not mean less national identity for all our countries and Member States in the European Union. Rather, it strengthens their particular national identity and brings our European culture together so that we may be a more effective ambassador in the world.
author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is particularly important, as we know, for two reasons: firstly, because we are talking about one of the substances that has caused most harm and deaths among citizens and workers at the plants where it is used and produced, namely asbestos. Secondly, because we are debating one of the first measures to implement the extremely significant regulation that has, in a way, marked this parliamentary term, that is to say REACH.
With the question we have asked and the draft resolution we will vote on today - let me say straight away to reassure the Commission and Vice-President Tajani who is here on its behalf - we are not opposing the draft implementing regulation that the Commission has adopted on this issue. I refer to Point 2.6 of this draft measure, which provides the missing Annex 17 that should have reproduced the provisions of Annex 1 of Directive 76 - the directive on dangerous substances, which will be replaced by REACH, and therefore repealed - this Point 2.6 extends the ban on the placing on the market of asbestos fibres and products containing asbestos.
The truth is that in this same decision, however, there are exemptions, to be granted by certain Member States - for the record, there are four of them - who may keep articles marketed before 2005 on the market, as well as diaphragms containing chrysotile asbestos used in production at existing electrolysis plants. The possibility of using these exemptions is of course subject to the Member States' compliance with all the Community rules on worker protection, effectively meaning that these plants, coming to the end of their lifecycle, do not generate problems for workers' health.
Directive 83/477/EEC, as amended by Directive 2003/18/EC, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work, contains a series of measures to ensure adequate protection of the health of workers, where the latter are exposed to risks linked to exposure to asbestos fibres. Companies must provide evidence of their ability to carry out demolition or asbestos removal work. Prior to the demolition or asbestos removal work, they must draw up a plan specifying the measures needed to ensure that workers are not exposed to an asbestos-in-air concentration of more than 0.1 asbestos fibres per cm3 during an average eight-hour shift.
There are detailed requirements concerning the process for the disposal and landfill of asbestos; for instance, the storage area must be re-covered each day and before each compaction operation. The landfill must be re-covered by a final layer in order to prevent the dispersion of fibres. Measures must be taken to prevent any possible use of the land after the closure of the landfill. Any potential exports of asbestos fibres are regulated under Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, and, since 2005, there has been only one notified case of asbestos fibres being exported from the European Union to a third country.
Moreover, the asbestos-related decisions appearing in Annex XVII of REACH are set to ban the manufacture of asbestos fibres within the European Union, which means that exports will be ruled out. Waste containing asbestos is hazardous waste. The Basel Convention and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on shipments of waste prohibit the export of asbestos waste to countries not belonging to the OECD. As regards shipments between Member States of the European Union and of the OECD, they are subject to a prior written notification and consent procedure.
This derogation, which had to be re-examined before 1 January, was intended to enable the companies concerned to make plans to stop using asbestos. Here we are today, with an 18-month delay; it is therefore time that we made progress. It is true that, as part of the review of Annex XVII to REACH, the Commission is proposing to extend the current ban on the use and marketing of asbestos fibres and products containing these fibres, but it is maintaining the option for asbestos to be used in factory-based electrolysis installations, with no time limit imposed, even though asbestos-free alternatives do exist and are used by many companies.
Moreover, the Commission is adopting a provision that permits the placing on the market of articles containing asbestos in accordance with a system that could vary from one country to another. This is unacceptable, since the use of this product is responsible for a large number of illnesses linked to exposure to asbestos fibres. Furthermore, the number of people succumbing to these illnesses is likely to continue to rise over the next few years, as this product was still being used up until a few years ago. The effects of asbestos on health have long been known.
It seems as though the Eternit trial, which began in Turin concerning the events at Casale Monferrato, where there is not one family that has not suffered a loss, counts for nothing. Asbestos should have been banned operationally by the Member States applying the 1999 directive. The States should have taken every possible precaution to protect exposed workers, by applying the 2003 directive, closing factories, neutralising contaminated sites and compensating the victims and local people. This has not happened everywhere. Little or nothing has been done.
I have already mentioned the trial in Turin, where Swiss and Belgian owners are accused. Everyone knew about it, but little was done, and above all the industry shirked its responsibilities, working within the loopholes created by the inertia of the public authorities. This inertia can be seen in the events in Italy, in Brioni, where asbestos has not been removed, in Porto Marghera and in Cengio, where deaths are still occurring. Today the industry is asking the Commission to accept another exemption from the 2006 REACH regulation, already granted for a limited period, for chrysotile asbestos fibres.
It is true, low-voltage electrolysis plants do represent a limited application, and there are only a few such plants, but where industrialists claim it is impossible to use any alternative then the plants should be closed. This may be blackmail, but alternatives to this process have been found in Sweden, using asbestos-free membrane technology as replacements, at low voltage, and a similar solution has also been adopted for the production of hydrogen. Why 'yes' in some States and 'no' in others? Because in the long battle to ban PCBs there have been countless omissions and stalling techniques, supported even by the European Commission Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry. In this case, too, a good example has not been set.
The European Parliament is doing its bit to compensate for the failings of others. This resolution calls on the Commission to bridge, by 2009, a legislative gap on the prohibition of second-hand products containing asbestos; roof pieces, aeroplane parts and whatever else should be disposed of once and for all. Yet again, precise dates are being set for a strategy to ban all types of asbestos by 2015, but these objectives were already set in 1999. Ten years have gone by and the deaths have continued.
Among the first initiatives of this parliamentary term, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left called for the establishment of a Community fund to compensate victims and for ad hoc funds for decontamination. This was a specific request to the Commission, which today is instead bowing to the will of the multinationals. We need to move on, however, to practical action and commitments. Only when these are in place, starting with the demands of this resolution, can we be more understanding. Today that willingness is not evident, and so we will vote against granting this exemption.
Similarly, as Satu Hassi has said, we have a long history on asbestos, and we have a very strong feeling that we need to watch out for that. When I was lying on my hospital bed, having my heart bypass and feeling sorry for myself, I was watching on the television the earthquake in Italy, and that put my problems into perspective. But it also, of course, reminded me in this context that, when you have a disaster like that, asbestos can be released into the atmosphere. Asbestos is very often safe while it is covered. As soon as it breaks out, that is when the dangers occur, and so one of the messages has to be that we need to look at the at-risk areas of our European Union to see where we should be highlighting the risk and monitoring it for the future.
Secondly, I have to say, somewhat symbolically, the fact that my last speech in this House should be on REACH and its application, which has occupied my time since the beginning of this parliamentary term, when it seemed we would never come to the end of that legislative journey, well, it shows that I am a lucky man, fortunate also to have known people like yourselves and like you, Mr President; working together we have come to a real understanding and have produced what I believe are truly significant results for European citizens.
I would like to thank them for the work they have done, and for participating in the various alliances that have done credit to our Parliament. So, as a member of the European Parliament and today as Commissioner and Vice-President of the Commission, I thank them for the extremely valuable contribution they have made to Parliament's work, showing that there can be - despite what certain journalists have said at times - good representatives who attend and genuinely serve the institutions, which represent half a billion Europeans. For that reason I wanted to thank them in this my last speech in this parliamentary term as commissioner.
As I was saying, I wanted to thank Mr Sacconi anyway, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for having brought this key issue to the table, and Mr Bowis, whose speech and comments have shown how important this subject is to all citizens. I think and hope that this debate has succeeded in dispelling any doubts and concerns: the Commission will report regularly to Parliament on the application of the regulation and, let me be clear, will not compromise on protecting workers, health and the environment.
It needs to be refined because we have seen, in the brief time that discussion has been allowed on this, that there are different interests, all of which are absolutely legitimate, among the airlines, that there are companies waiting to replace others, where the first are unable to meet their commitments, that there are now distinct interests among airlines and airports, something that did not happen only a short time ago, and above all that there are the interests of passengers, most importantly those served by airports and airlines in the outermost regions, who would be at greater risk should the choice of retaining or abolishing slots depend solely on their profitability for the companies concerned.
This is a very sensitive topic and one that I believe we will have to revisit. I have to say that the reason, or worthy compromise, if you will, that lies behind our swift adoption of the proposal in the forms to be presented here is in fact in this, it is in being sure that the Commission will honour its commitment to return to this subject in a more thought-out, in-depth way, to tackle once and for all what is a crucial issue not only for overcoming the current crisis, but also for completing the process of restructuring and liberalising the global air market, and for building a better air market within Europe.
Mr President, honourable Members, once again, as a former Member of this House, I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism and its chairman for their productive work when I was an MEP and for the cooperation they have shown me since I had the honour to be appointed, and endorsed by Parliament, as European Commissioner for Transport. This fruitful partnership, ladies and gentlemen, can be seen again today, and so I must thank Parliament once more, especially the transport committee, chaired by Mr Costa, for the speed with which they have handled the European Commission's proposal on slots.
In light of this, I share Mr Costa's concern. The Commission proposal is not a definitive solution. It is perhaps a proposal intended to address an emergency, but which will then need to be re-examined in detail in order to redesign the whole system; in fact on 15 April, in response to Mr Costa's concerns and comments, I informed him, as the committee chairman, that the Commission Directorate-General for Energy and Transport is already preparing to present a proposal as soon as possible to revise the regulation.
The rule on the use of slots has already been suspended twice in the past in order to tackle crises. It is a global response to a global crisis, a response that clearly does not affect one or two Member States but affects the air transport system of the entire European Union and, in the most serious of circumstances - the attacks of 11 September and the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crisis - similar measures were taken. The crisis hitting the air transport industry today is probably more serious than those, and as yet we have no indication as to when we will start to see improvements.
The reality is that traffic is in continual decline. Suspending the 'use it or lose it' rule for the summer season will benefit all companies, European or otherwise, without any discrimination, as the IATA and many non-European companies have pointed out, moreover. I am sure that this measure, which will be for a limited period and is an exception - the suspension will in fact be in force from 29 March to 26 October this year to then allow slots to be retained for the summer season of the following year - will give some breathing space to all companies, allowing them to address the drop in demand.
The suspension now makes it possible for airlines to scrap flights in line with falling demand beyond the planned minimum usage without losing their take-off and landing rights for the next season. In my opinion, this is justified as a one-off, for one period, as the Vice-President said, because there has been an unforeseeable collapse in passenger numbers due to the international financial and economic crisis and because airlines cannot yet predict how passenger numbers will develop in the future. The suspension also helps to protect the environment, as airlines might otherwise feel obliged to fly half-empty aircraft just to keep their slots.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, at the outset the PPE-DE Group rejected the regulation also proposed by you of empowering the Commission, without genuine codecision on the part of Parliament, to demand the suspension of the rule simply in the comitology procedure. We believe that, if you intend to make such a proposal for the winter flight plan, Parliament will have to examine it carefully, because we would have to consider the interests of the many different types of airlines as well as the interests of airports and passengers more carefully. It is 'yes' to a one-off suspension but 'no' to the possibility of extension without the involvement of Parliament.
In all honesty, I believe that, with swine flu appearing not to be as virulent as first feared, airlines will ultimately have to be able to anticipate what possible passenger numbers and relations to expect over the coming years. We must expect airlines to submit realistic plans so that airports have the opportunity to offer unused slots to other airlines. It must be in our interests that airports be able to use their capacities in the best interests of their customers, the passengers. I have one other comment on the new, fundamental revision of the Slots Directive. I believe that the slots belong to the public and not to the airports or the airlines, and that is why we must pay particular attention to this in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate, this plenary session and my parliamentary activity draw to a close, allow me to extend my sincerest thanks to my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism and in the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Vice-President of the Commission and his entire DG TREN team. We have spent the last five years working together in the interests of the citizens of the European Union. I will keep my fingers crossed for you that the next five years will bring more of the same. The Committee on Transport and Tourism is an important committee, and I thank you for your excellent cooperation.
But yet again the civil aviation industry has demonstrated its ability to be disunited on this important issue, with big airlines clamouring for a suspension while low-cost airlines and airports are demanding no suspension. What concerns me is that the big airlines, backed up by their various alliances, will not be satisfied with one suspension but will demand others and, knowing the unhealthy, undemocratic influence that some of them have both in this and national parliaments, I believe today is a mere start of a process, sadly not the end.
My group will support the compromise proposed by our rapporteur and endorsed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, but I stress that this suspension, as my colleague Georg Jarzembowski often says of the 'use it or lose it' clause, is a one-off for one period and does not represent a green light for further suspensions. If the Commission feels that further suspensions are needed, then they must be made part of a revised regulation, fully involving this Parliament and fully respecting the rights of this Parliament. It is 'yes' to debate, it is 'yes' to cooperation, but it is 'no' to comitology.
We are supposedly talking about liberalisation, but in fact what we are dealing with is a monopoly. I say this because of departures from Linate airport and Malpensa airport that are monopolised by Alitalia-Air France. Take Linate, which is in dire straits with 160 000 positions in difficulty. Should we leave Linate congested to allow for the Frosinone airport advocated by Undersecretary Letta? I wonder then, are all these non-services provided because Alitalia does not have the aeroplanes to cover these services and these working hours? Why, then, do we not give them to other companies that can provide a service?
I wish you all well, and would especially like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Chairman Costa, Commissioner Tajani and all the Members of this House, and I would just like to conclude with an appeal for greater transparency, which I hope the next Parliament will truly offer, because we voted for transparency regarding the situation of the stagiaires, assistants and many of our co-workers, but it unfortunately has yet to materialise. Most of all, I would emphasise what we should offer in terms - I am finishing, Mr President - of transparency regarding the work we do here, since the press coverage, especially in the majority of the Italian press, is demagogical and totally absurd.
Mr Tajani, you pointed out that this was not the first and, unfortunately, would probably not be the last crisis in the aviation industry that we, as well as the aviation industry, would have to deal with. It is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions. We have managed to do that. But we should not hide the fact that the crisis has also sometimes been used, is being used and will be used as a pretext to organise regulations that do not really serve the aviation industry or people but specific interests.
In the Denied Boarding Directive, with its relatively imprecise wording on the issue of 'extraordinary circumstances', we gave airlines the opportunity to interpret this notion very extensively. That is precisely what they are doing - at the expense of passengers. In this directive, we also neglected to impose fines for delays. In the last weeks and months in particular, airlines have exploited the fact they do not have to pay for delays but basically only have to grant minimum rights to passengers - again at the expense of passengers. We should not make the same mistake again.
On another point, this is also my last day of school in this House, as it is for many fellow Members. On the first day of school you normally get a school bag. Perhaps on the last day there will also be a bag of sweets. Mr Tajani, I would like to request a 'sweet'. Please do away with the nonsense we created at that time with the regulation on liquids and security checks at airports as quickly as possible. This regulation has been of benefit to no one and has protected no one. It has only caused anger. Just because no one is brave enough and resolute enough to tell people this and to carry out this abolition, we are all still suffering under this unspeakable regulation. Please fill this school bag and do away with this nonsense.
(FR) Mr President, I listened to Mr Boso just now, and I am not underestimating the fact that there are special cases, particularly in Italy, where it would be preferable today to see slots opened up. However, I do believe that we need to keep a cool head and recognise that the crisis is affecting the aviation sector more quickly and more profoundly than ever before. It is without doubt one of the first sectors to be affected by budget cuts - corporate budgets, in terms of business travellers, and household budgets, in terms of summer holidaymakers. The other option would have been to open up slots completely, resulting in all likelihood in a scenario where the most powerful airlines would turn their empty aeroplanes round on the best slots, would abandon the least profitable spatial-planning slots, and where the low-cost airlines, which have a different economic model, would take advantage of it to sell off a few slots.
In short, this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances. It would have had nothing to do with the real economy, with a functioning market; rather, it probably would have played a part in social dumping or in the defence of positions acquired, in the case of the most powerful airlines. That is why I believe that this moratorium is the least worst solution, provided that it is only temporary, that the events and the impact of this crisis are closely monitored, that developments are accounted for before Parliament, and that we open up the slots market while taking the time to effect a policy change and to consolidate a new European Union policy.
This is my final speech before this House. It is a great privilege, after 10 years of working in the same committee, to take the floor at what is practically the end of the parliamentary term, in one of the very last debates, and to do so among one's friends. I should like to say what a pleasure it has been for me to work with such strong and such brilliant personalities; I shall not forget the experience. This committee is an elite committee, I think it must be said. It has done remarkable work; it is a credit to the work of Parliament, it is a credit to the European Parliament. I should like to thank all of my colleagues, from all of the political groups. I do not think that I will enjoy another such rich, honest, sincere and profound political experience as this one.
Ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing something which is interesting because it shows the confrontation between the absolutely fundamental interest of airlines and the interest of consumers and passengers. At a time of crisis the airlines are saving themselves by asking for these limits, just as we have said here, to be extended into next year. If we help the airlines here, and I think that would be sensible, they must not do this at the cost of passengers. A situation in which the airlines really treat this matter as a pretext and cancel flights with impunity is a very dangerous situation.
Mr President, having heard from a number of speakers who will no longer be with us after the next election, I am hoping that the electorate in Britain will allow me to come back here for another term. This is the last time that I shall be speaking from this particular seat in the Chamber: I shall be relocated during the changes. Can I just congratulate Mr Jarzembowski in particular on the work he has done on behalf of us all in the committee, and thank Mr Tajani, and also Mr Costa for bringing this matter before us.
We will, of course, support the Commission in this. But I do not support the use of simplified procedure in the future and I think it would be a good idea for us to have a hearing on the Slot Allocation Directive, perhaps in the autumn or winter when we come back. We must find measures to put in place market-based incentives for airlines and airports. In times of difficulty, efficiency and innovation need to be rewarded - I am a fan of regional airports in particular.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission has adopted, as a matter of urgency, a proposal to amend Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 on the allocation of airport slots. The basic aim of this proposal is to suspend the 80/20 rule or, in other words, to prevent slots purchased previously from being auctioned off where they have not been used. This is not intended as a principle ad eternum nor as a right of ownership - as the committee chairman, Mr Costa, has just said - but as a temporary measure.
I therefore want to express my thanks and gratitude, in this House, to you, Mr President, to Vice-President Tajani and to all my colleagues in my group. I must in particular mention those who have spoken here today - Mr Simpson and Mr Savary - and also those Members from other groups, such as the chairman of our committee, Mr Costa, with whom I have had the pleasure of working on several reports, and also Mr Jarzembowski, who I cannot miss out. He has led his group in this area of transport and has always been very cooperative, often rejecting my ideas, but telling me that he understood, and always with great elegance and a great sense of democracy.
It is our duty to find solutions to the problems which have occurred at the moment, but we must not lose sight of resolving the problems of the future either. Parliament has called on the European Commission to produce a coherent master plan for increasing airport capacity. A number of European airports have similar plans, but what is absolutely necessary is to coordinate them at European level as part of the single European sky initiative approved recently. I firmly believe that, as a result of setting up the European Observatory last November, this wish will come true in the near future. This plan is crucial for the sustainable development of the air transport sector, which is vital to the European economy.
The issue of slots is not only a European problem. Traffic at European airports does not only come from Europe. For this reason, a global solution needs to be found for the slots issue with the support of IATA, Eurocontrol and all the other agencies concerned in this area. This is why I believe that the recommendation made today to the Commission by Parliament to re-examine in the near future the impact of the crisis on air traffic and to review in this context Directive 95/93 is the most suitable method which we can propose at this time of uncertainty.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already heard here, air transport is affected by various critical situations, including SARS and Mexican flu. At the same time, there has been a fall in passenger numbers. I would like to mention one of the factors that may be playing a part in the decrease in passenger numbers, and that is the quality and capacity of airport services, especially security checks. I have to say that they are not only undignified - for instance, taking off your shoes and walking barefoot through the security check - but also, in terms of hygiene, a liability and a health hazard. I would not be surprised if passenger numbers had declined because of fears about infection - fears which the media are currently encouraging. So I would like the European Union to have better control over the hygiene of safety checks in airports, so that it can improve the well-being, safety and comfort of passengers. As this is the last time I shall take the floor before this House, I thank you all for your cooperation and wish you every success in the future.
(CS) I would like to say that the current situation is marked, above all, by the gap between steadily improving technological capabilities and security measures which are making life difficult for airport passengers and staff alike. I think it is in our interests, especially in the economic crisis now making itself felt throughout the world - and probably the autumn will bring another wave of this crisis, another attack of financial insecurity - that we should do everything we can to ensure that this sector overcomes its crisis and expands. It is my opinion that those who have resources and do not put them to use are destined to go into decline. I would like the European Union to avoid such a situation, and I would like us to be at the forefront of progress where the transport sector is concerned.
For precisely that reason I would like to reassure Mr Jarzembowski, who asked me a question about the comitology procedure: the compromise, which has the Commission's full support, provides for the use of codecision procedure as regards possible renewal for the winter season. This is purely hypothetical, because, I would emphasise, the measure is a temporary one and applies for six months only. Nonetheless, any future proposal for renewal must always be preceded by an impact assessment, taking account of the effects on consumers and on competition. It will also form part of a general review of the slots regulation, to which I have made a commitment before the Council, at the request of the UK transport minister, as I have confirmed many times in this House.
It is, however, the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention. Indeed, data provided by the European Airport Association tells us that 80% of European airports have seen a reduction in traffic, in January, between 8% and 10% as regards passengers, and between 25% and 30% as regards freight. This is therefore a difficult situation. I, too, share the hope and wish expressed by certain Members that the current influenza will turn out to be less serious than it was initially believed to be. We cannot hide the fact, though, that the proposal to suspend flights from the entire European Union to a country or to areas where the epidemic first broke out was on the agenda at last week's meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers, as well as the Council of Health Ministers. There could be repercussions, therefore, but no decision was taken since the situation was not deemed serious enough. However, it is clear that there is debate in this sector; some crews have decided not to fly to areas with known cases of influenza, which has caused a further drop in air passenger numbers.
I believe that as regards passenger rights - since it is a subject highlighted by many influential Members - the main thing is to maintain connections and frequency for the benefit precisely of citizens, and then to overcome the crisis. The financial soundness and sustainability of our airlines are key parameters to safeguarding the advantages of the internal market, and thanks to the internal market passengers have access to a variety of connections, routes and prices unprecedented in Europe. I want passengers to be able to continue to enjoy this possibility of choice. As regards the regulations on supervision, we must strengthen the monitoring and application of Regulation 261. To this end, the Commission will publish - let me address this to Mr Rack - a communication on the application of the regulation in the second half of 2009. On the basis of this evaluation we will draw conclusions as to the future.
With regard to liquids, as you know, we have already published the formerly secret annex behind this, and thanks to the use of new and more effective technologies from the point of view of security, we hope to be able to review the situation before 2010. I was highly sceptical of the liquids affair when I was an MEP, I remain so today and I am working precisely in order to reach that objective. As regards the concerns expressed by other Members over certain airports that could run into problems following this measure - I refer in particular to a European airport that forms part of one of the EU's priority projects, the Malpensa airport - I can offer some information concerning airlines other than Alitalia-Air France. Let me read you some statistics: at Malpensa airport, a German airline, Lufthansa, had 8 741 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 19 520, an increase in capacity of more than 100%. Also at Malpensa, a low-cost airline, easyJet, had 15 534 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 22 936, a significant rise representing a 47% increase in capacity. It is also well known that the new airline Lufthansa Italia has plans, as we can read on the airline's own website, thus in the public domain, to expand its network with new flights from Milan to Rome and to the cities of Naples and Bari as well as other European cities - Barcelona, Brussels, Bucharest, Budapest, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris. I can say then with absolute certainty that this measure will not cause any harm - and I say this as European Commissioner for Transport - to an airport and European hub like Malpensa, which is included in the Union's priority projects.
I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament again for this debate, confirming what I said in my earlier speech, in reply to Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Simpson and Mr Blokland, as regards the commitment I am making today as Commissioner for Transport - and I hope to be able to do so again as future Commissioner for Transport - concerning the codecision procedure for matters relating to the issue of slots. Some of the ideas put forward, such as those included by the rapporteur in his initial amendments, deserve to be properly studied in the context of the future review of the regulation on the allocation of slots and - I repeat - the Commission staff, whom I thank again for the valuable contribution they have made in these weeks of difficult work, are willing to do this and are indeed in the process of drafting the new text. At the same time, as stipulated in the amendment we are debating today, the Commission will watch carefully to see how the air sector crisis develops and will propose measures to address this as necessary and appropriate, attaching great importance to safeguarding passenger rights. I will do this not only in the field of air transport but also in maritime, rail and bus and coach transport. This is a commitment we have made: there are legislative measures being discussed. I hope that the next parliamentary term can bring these to a conclusion, as our primary objective nonetheless remains to meet the needs of the people who elect this Parliament and who, through the consensus of this Parliament, rely on the European Commission, the Community executive.
Just two suggestions, which I hope may be of some use: the first is to follow closely the effects of this suspension since, clearly, it will lead to a reduction of slots and mean that some slots and therefore some lines will not be used. The choice of what to do and what not to do will be in the hands of individual companies. In future, I think it would be better to consider that, if we have to reduce this activity again, then there should be public control of that choice, rather than leaving it purely to the profitability criteria of individual businesses.
To conclude, I am going to let you in on a little secret, just while the last few Members take their seats. You perhaps wonder how we classify our amendments: is Amendment X, written in Latvian, closer to the original Portuguese text than Amendment Y, written in Slovenian? Who is responsible for this classification? Well, the answer is sitting next to me. It is this gentleman who has the formidable task of carrying out this semantic classification. Why entrust it to him? Quite simply because Paul Dunstan speaks 27 languages.
That is as nothing compared to the comments I have had from members of his party in e-mails. I have been described by members of UKIP as a 'paedophile' and a 'big fat git'. Indeed, when I had a bomb in my office, UKIP members wrote to me, and Mr Farage put out a press release, basically saying that it was what I deserved. Recently I have had UKIP e-mails telling me that the heir to the British throne is better known as 'Big Ears'. That tells you all you need to know about the UK Independence Party.
(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to ask you, pursuant to Article 151(1) and (3), to reject Amendment 45a, tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, as inadmissible insofar as it deals with the statement made by Pope Benedict for the following reasons. First, this statement was made in 2009, while the report deals with human rights violations that took place in 2008. This amendment does not therefore amend the text it is intended to amend. Second, this amendment compares the statements made by the Pope with human rights violations of the most serious kind, the use of the death penalty, human rights violations in China, and torture everywhere. This comparison shows a cynical disregard for the victims of human rights violations throughout the world.
'Underlines the importance of promoting sexual and reproductive health rights, as a precondition for any successful fight against HIV/AIDS, which causes enormous loss in terms of human lives and economic development, affecting particularly the poorest regions in the world; is concerned about declarations made by Pope Benedict XVI, which create the impression that condom use could even lead to an increased risk of contagion; is of the opinion that those statements will severely hamper the fight against HIV/AIDS;'. The remainder of the amendment remains unchanged.
Today we are addressing the case of Roxana Saberi, a journalist who had her trial just three weeks ago and was condemned to eight years in prison for so-called espionage. The fact is that Ms Saberi has had no access to her lawyer for more than a month. There was no chance of a fair or transparent trial, because the trial was held in camera. She was on hunger strike for at least two weeks. It is true that she has ended this, but her health is in a very precarious state.
Nowadays, there is no longer any doubt that power has fallen into the hands of groups which not only seek conflict with the United States and Israel, but are also extremely conservative, intolerant and undemocratic. They oppress their own citizens, they have brought the judiciary and the army under the firm grip of religious fanatics and they are preventing the electorate from voting for people who hold more moderate views. The rights of women and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities have been shoved to one side and the death penalty is often carried out in public, in the cruellest of manners, as a means of suppressing non-conformist behaviour.
In this regard, the comment made by the Secretary of Tire as Mãos de Caim, Sergio D'Elia, is extremely pertinent and highlights the most important point: the brutality of the Mullahs' regime is not only the responsibility of the Iranian fundamentalist regime. European governments are consenting to this through their silence, tolerance and constant desire to appease, and they are succumbing to the Iranian political and commercial blackmail. The Tehran regime is threatening the peace and security of the whole world and, even more clearly, of its own citizens, through acts which have been practised for decades. Instead of taking this into account, Europe is making Iran the solution to the problems of the Middle East, when it is actually the main problem.
Iran, a country with thousands of years of civilisation and culture, is today in a sorry state of affairs as far as democracy, civil rights and justice are concerned. Some of our countries in the West are not free from blame for this situation. Let us not forget that governments such as those of the USA and Britain have for years supported, armed and kept in power the well-known monstrous dictatorship of the Shah of Iran. It was inevitable that, when the Shah was finally overthrown by popular uprising, Islamic extremists would find fertile ground to root themselves in power and cultivate feelings of hate towards the West.
Then came the excessively aggressive behaviour of successive US administrations and the position of drastic sanctions, which only caused further suffering to ordinary Iranian people and further aggravated their hostile feelings towards the West. Hopefully the new President of the USA, Mr Obama, who has shown signs that he prefers to fight with his brain rather than with his fists, as the previous President, Mr Bush, so unsuccessfully did, will give new hope for the improvement of the likes of the Iranian people and the betterment of relations with the West.
Madam President, Roxana Saberi is a 32-year-old journalist with dual American and Iranian citizenship, and is a graduate of several universities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Iran. She was working as a journalist in Iran and continued to do so following the expiry of her accreditation, and was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison on a false charge of spying for the United States. In protest at the false charges and the lack of a fair trial she went on hunger strike. She is very emaciated. She began to drink sweetened water under medical care and has now ended her hunger strike, and is waiting for her appeal to be heard. Her health and her life are still in danger.
Yesterday the BBC announced that next week, on 12 May, the Appeal Court will hear Roxana Saberi's appeal, but that this would again take place in a closed-door session. We condemn the Iranian Revolutionary Court's unfounded decision on Roxana Saberi. In addition, I think it is very important to once again urge Iranian Government institutions to comply with the provisions of all international human rights instruments ratified by Iran, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which both guarantee the right to a fair trial.
This is not the first time we have discussed Iran in this plenary session. This time we are concerned about the unlawful imprisonment of Roxana Saberi. She was first arrested for an apparently minor offence - purchasing wine - although in Iran it is an offence. Then, however, there was the charge that she was working as a journalist without official accreditation, which later turned into the charge that she was a US spy. The Iranian Government organised a one-day closed-door trial without witnesses or concrete, publicly declared charges.
This is not the first time the Iranian Government has trampled on human rights, imprisoned people unlawfully and passed verdicts which contravene international standards. The execution of Delara Darabi, the detention of the journalist Maryam Malek and defenders of workers' rights - these are but a few examples. We must recognise that Iranian fundamentalists continue to organise political trials in an attempt to further intimidate free thinkers. It is regrettable that Iran is continuing its policy of self-isolation in this way and is failing to exploit initiatives by the international community and the new US Administration to normalise relations.
This is what passes for justice in Iran. The medieval torture and execution of women - even pregnant women - and children is commonplace. The abuse of human rights is a daily fact of life, and yet we have people in this Parliament who support this corrupt and evil regime: just like those European companies which continue to do business with Iran, their eyes and ears are closed to the screams of the oppressed. Shame on them and shame on the brutal mullahs. They should remember the lessons of history: every fascist regime is doomed to fail; freedom and justice will always prevail over evil.
(NL) Madam President, my original speaking time was unfairly cut short as it approached the two-and-a-half-minute limit, but the conclusion of my argument was that you cannot create change through foreign interventions or other forms of military violence. It was exactly that kind of approach in the past which led to the birth of the current regime. If you threaten Iran with foreign interventions, many people in Iran who hate the current government will actually rush to the government's support in order to defend their fatherland.
When we talk of the history of the EU, we tend to maintain that the cooperation has created a foundation for peace in a Europe that has so often been characterised by the opposite. I would like to tell you that my grandfather was a Swedish soldier posted to the Norwegian border during the Second World War - a war in which Sweden was neutral. The nearest my grandfather got to the war was to occasionally get a glimpse of it - from a safe distance. For a long time, that was Sweden's relationship with Europe: observing from a distance.
A few years later, in 1997, after Sweden had joined the Union, I was involved in putting together the PPE Group's youth organisation, Youth of EPP, and I myself became its first chairman. It enabled me to see how European cooperation worked in practice. Together we sought European solutions to European problems. We got to know not only each other, but also each other's history and culture. It enabled me to get to know the capital cities of Europe - and I can hardly count the number of churches I visited in Europe in the process.
In 20 years Sweden has gone from observing at a distance to being an active part of the European cooperation. This has in turn had an effect on the Swedish population. Ten years ago, one in three Swedes thought EU membership was good for the country, but just as many thought the opposite. Today that has reversed. Nearly two in three Swedes believe that EU membership is good for Sweden. In the elections to the European Parliament in June, more that 45 per cent of Swedes turned out to vote. That is eight per cent more than in 2004, and it is above the average for Europe. Today Sweden is a country that appreciates and takes a positive view of EU membership. We woke up to it a bit late, but we have worked hard to catch up. That is a victory for all of us who believe in European cooperation.
Mr President, honourable Members, we are facing the question of the fate of our generation - a social problem which, unlike many others, is growing slowly - and only in the wrong direction. Our planet has a fever. Its temperature is rising - and it is up to us to react. The Greenland icecap is shrinking by more than 100 cubic kilometres every year. The icecap in the Western Antarctic is melting at an increasingly fast rate. We know that the shrinking Greenland ice alone could result in an increase in sea levels of up to two metres. The effects will be dramatic. If the sea level were to rise by just one metre around the world, a hundred million people would be forced to leave their homes in Asia alone. The most vulnerable are those in Bangladesh, eastern China and Vietnam.
There would also be other serious consequences, however. The weather will change, with the risk that many species of flora and fauna could become extinct. This is the case even if we stay within the 2 °C target set by the UN, which was backed last week both by the G8 and by the Major Economies Forum in L'Aquila. Our climate is under threat from both our use of and our dependence on fossil fuels. That is the bad news. So what is the good news?
Moreover, measures to counter climate change have very useful side effects - effects which in themselves justify the measures. If we consume less energy, we will save money. We will improve public finances while at the same time households will have greater resources. If we invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we will improve our energy security. We will be less dependent on imports from countries that are sometimes both politically and economically unstable. Our investments in the green economy will create new job opportunities and drive growth in the decades ahead.
Allow me to give a specific example. In January, many EU countries were affected by the gas crisis in Ukraine. Last week I spoke to President Yushchenko concerning how we can try to avoid a similar thing happening again. At the same time, it is important to be able to turn the viewpoint around. If Ukraine invested in energy efficiency so that the country reached the same level as the Czech Republic or Slovenia, the amount of energy saved would correspond to the entire country's gas imports for its own use from Russia. Ukraine could then become completely independent of gas imports from Russia and save a great deal of money besides - simply by improving its own energy efficiency. This is where we must seek the answers where the climate is concerned.
So how do we get there? Europe must act together and collectively. We must show leadership and keep our promises. Europe is crucial to getting others to join an international agreement. All over the world we must set a price on emissions. We must start using national carbon taxes and emissions trading. The environmentally friendly alternatives will then emerge. If the price of using fossil fuels is set without regard to climate impact, global warming will continue. The alternatives will not emerge. Measures to increase energy efficiency will not become economically worthwhile.
That is not enough, however. We need to have a wider answer to the question of 'how?'. It is not enough to limit emissions in a group of countries that voluntarily agree to reductions, but which together account for just 30 per cent of emissions. Neither is it sufficient to have solutions that are based only on restrictions in the most developed countries. Even if the so-called Annex I countries were to reduce their emissions to zero, the rapidly growing emissions of the developing countries would still take us above the 2 °C target.
Mr President, honourable Members, the economic and financial crisis spread like wildfire around the world within the space of a few weeks. Some people had given warnings, but for most people it came as a surprise - particularly its extent and depth. In a global world, problems also spread quickly to others. The force of the downturn is such that nobody has a miracle cure for getting out of it quickly. Coordinated action on the part of the EU is the best tool we have to meet the challenges of the crisis. Moreover, there is still much that can go wrong. In the circumstances, the EU has succeeded in showing leadership through these testing times. We agreed on guarantees and rules of the road for supporting the banks. We agreed on a common recovery plan to stimulate the economy.
It is unsustainable for three out of 10 Europeans of working age to be excluded from the labour market. Our aim must be an active labour market policy that, together with well-functioning social security systems, is able to manage change effectively. We must strengthen the individual's employability and ability to assert him- or herself in the labour market. In addition, we must activate and reactivate the unemployed. With more people in work there will be more support available for those who are not. We must also concentrate on reforms, modernisation and adaptation to a new reality. The world outside the EU is not standing still. It is moving forward at a tremendous rate. That is something we should acknowledge and accept.
In the wake of the economic crisis we can see ideas of increased protectionism. The WTO confirms that the number of trade-restricting measures has increased considerably in the past three months. Consequently, I welcome the L'Aquila agreement on restarting the Doha round - in order to ensure that the countries of the world again take the free trade-friendly path that we know benefits us all in the long run. The objective must be an EU that comes out of this crisis stronger.
Nonetheless, the institutional framework is important because it defines what we can do and in which areas. That is why the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is so central. The Treaty will make the EU more democratic, more transparent, more effective and more influential in the international arena. Most important of all, however, is the fact that having the Treaty of Lisbon in place will close the chapter on an inward-looking phase of EU cooperation. It is now time for the EU to look outwards and forwards. The Swedish Presidency is prepared to carry out all the preparatory work to ensure a smooth transition to a new Treaty, but naturally that requires the Treaty to have been ratified by all the Member States. Let us hope that that becomes a reality in the months ahead.
International criminality is growing ever stronger. Criminal networks no longer see their activities bounded by national borders. We can see how the drugs trade and human trafficking are spreading. This is a threat to our democratic values and a threat to our citizens. At the same time, the freedom to move freely across borders is fundamental to our community - to study, work and live in another EU country. New times call for new answers, however. Consequently, this autumn we will draw up a new programme in this area that we will call the Stockholm Programme. The Stockholm Programme will sharpen the instruments that create security in the EU and that fight organised crime and terrorism.
Mr President, honourable Members, with strength and influence comes an international responsibility that we are still striving to shoulder. It is accompanied by a duty to use this responsibility in everyone's best interest. The EU must work for peace, freedom, democracy and human rights. We have a responsibility to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world, a responsibility to live up to the UN's Millennium Development Goals. We also have a responsibility to support the work of the UN in other areas, to work together with our strategic partners, to become involved in the world's crisis hotspots - whether it is the peace process in the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea or the great challenges on the African continent.
Mr President, honourable Members, as a result of European cooperation, today our continent lives in peace and prosperity, in freedom and stability. We have open borders and a social model that combines a market economy with consideration for each other. This is our shared Europe. Our citizens also want to know, however, that Europe is borne by ideas for the future and that our cooperation not only has a historical purpose but is also forward-looking. That is why we, as their elected representatives, have a responsibility to say what we want to do with Europe. Let me tell you how I see the Europe of the future.
Mr President, honourable Members, it is an honour for me to stand here with you and represent European democracy. Many people have said to me that this will be the most difficult presidency for many years. There are many challenges, and we must prepare for the unexpected. Many ask whether a country the size of Sweden can shoulder this responsibility. Not alone - but together we can face these challenges. Let us do so with vision and drive, with initiative and courage. Europe needs it. The people of Europe need it. The European project is about the dream of solving people's problems together. This dream makes Europe strong. This year, 2009, is a fateful year for European cooperation. We have the chance to take the next step. The Swedish Presidency is ready to take on the challenge. Let us take it on together!
Of course, responsibility for labour market policies lies with Member States, but we can and should use existing European instruments to help Member States keep people in employment and train them for the jobs of the future. That is why the European Commission is about to make a proposal to simplify Structural Fund procedures and waive the need for national cofinancing from the European Social Fund for 2009 and 2010. We will also redeploy resources in order to fund a new microcredit facility for employment and social inclusion. I hope this Parliament will support these proposals.
We need to rebuild our economic model and put the values back at the heart of our social market economy, where they belong. We need to build an economy and a society based on opportunity, responsibility and solidarity, an economy which will have to reinvent new sources of growth because we cannot rely for ever on monetary and fiscal stimulus; a Europe of open and well-performing markets; a Europe of smart, green growth; a Europe with more effective regulation and supervision of financial markets; a Europe that deepens its single market and uses its potential to the full; a Europe that resists the trends for fragmentation or protectionism.
Our leadership role was very much appreciated in the meetings last week in L'Aquila in the G8, and in the Major Economies Forum. You will have heard about the progress made at these meetings. For the first time, all participants committed to capping the temperature increase at 2°C to respect climate science. This is certainly a welcome step forward, but we should not delude ourselves: our ambition and our commitment are not yet matched by others. Europe is far ahead of the curve in relation to the rest of the world and, frankly, 145 days from Copenhagen, that worries me.
The European Union has constantly reinvented itself, from the initial vocation of healing a war-torn continent to the building of the internal market and then on to the reunification of Europe. During these last 50 years Europe has consistently exceeded expectations, confounding doubts. I am sure that we will also rise to the new challenge we face: laying the foundations for the smart, green economy of the future. We will succeed if we respect the key lesson from half a century of European integration: the European Union advances when all its parts cooperate in a spirit of openness, trust and partnership. The Swedish Presidency programme recognises this; the European Commission stands ready to play its part and so, I am sure, does this Parliament.
Firstly, Mr Buzek, I salute you as a man of resistance and as one of the founders of Solidarność, as the man from Silesia who never forgot his roots, his history or his values. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is also proud to have convinced the vast majority of MEPs from all political backgrounds - Mr Schulz included - to make you the spokesman for 500 million citizens. Yes, Mr President, your election is the symbol of this open Europe, of this tolerant Europe, of this political Europe championed by the PPE Group and by the majority of our fellow Members here present.
President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, what we expect of you is that you will make action the dominant theme of the Swedish Presidency over the next six months - in other words, faced with the twin challenge of the economy and climate change, we are saying that we need to do more, and faster, in order to come out of the crisis, by bringing our social market economy model fully into operation. I firmly believe that it is the vitality of the economy and that alone that will enable us to conduct the true social policy that we need.
To do more, and faster, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, that is also what the PPE Group expects of you where the fight against global warming is concerned. It is the responsibility of Europe, under your leadership, to lead the world in this action, which everyone here recognises as being urgent and a priority. And what better opportunity to act and to speed things up than the climate-change conference to be held in December in Copenhagen, in other words, on our own territory!
On the issue of climate change, Europe has proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that it can take action when it wants to. The task now is to capitalise on this, to make the other world powers join us. I am of course thinking of the United States, which must turn its words into deeds, but I am also thinking of the emerging countries, be it China, India or Brazil, which can no longer ignore the fact that they are heavily responsible for global warming. We shall therefore judge the Swedish Presidency on the ways in which it copes with the crisis and in the light of its results regarding the environment.
I shall conclude by saying that, in order to act strongly on these two fronts, Europe must be equipped with appropriate institutions. The last year has shown us that, with the same treaty and with the same outdated principle of unanimity, it was possible to make progress with Europe but that it was also possible to reach a deadlock. It is a question of political will, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso. Speed things up: that is what the PPE Group is asking you to do over the next six months, and we have faith in the Swedish Presidency. Speed things up: that is what Europeans asked for in electing this Parliament and that is what we must give them if, in five years' time, we wish to see more of them turn out to vote.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency comes at a time of new beginnings for the institutions. It is not only this Parliament that is starting anew; Europe is in a period of transition between the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon, and - as we all know - it is a time of uncertainty in which we nevertheless need clarity with regard to economic, financial, labour market and climate policy decisions in the European Union and its Member States.
On the subject of job security, I would like to say this to you, Mr Reinfeldt: what seriously jeopardises jobs in Europe and is an even greater threat to social cohesion is the case law of the European Court of Justice. As you have just said, you travel a lot in Sweden and in Europe. So do we and what we hear from our citizens is that they do not want a Europe where companies move from country to country cutting wage levels. We therefore need initiatives from the European Union.
You also need to deal with another institutional issue, namely that of how the next Commission will be appointed. In this regard, I have to say that to some extent I get the general impression that not only you, but also all of your colleagues in the Council have been affected by the new institutional beginnings and the uncertainty about which Treaty we should actually be using as the basis for our actions, and that no one really knows where we are. It is a little bit like Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking in her Villa Villekulla - I will make the world the way I want it to be. Wonderful!
If we appoint the President of the Commission on the basis of the Treaty of Nice, we will have 20 commissioners. In that case, I would like to know which country will have no commissioner. To this, the Council will naturally say 'no, we certainly do not want to start a bloodbath behind closed doors. So, we have a wonderful solution - we will nominate the commissioner initially on the basis of the Treaty of Nice. It will take a couple of months for the Commission to be set up and by then the people of Ireland will have voted and we will have the Treaty of Lisbon. Then we can vote on everything else on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon. Great!'
I would therefore like to state very clearly what we are expecting. My proposal, Prime Minister, was that you should not take the formalisation decision straight away, but first send your candidate to Parliament so that he can tell us what he wants to do to restore the economy, safeguard jobs, combat climate change, introduce an employment pact, an initiative for a public services directive and an initiative to improve the Posting of Workers Directive and establish a guarantee between the Commission and Parliament regarding an evaluation of the social consequences of the Commission initiatives. We could have already discussed everything with the candidate weeks ago to see whether he would receive a majority vote in this House on the basis of his proposals. Then you could have made a decision regarding formalisation.
Mr President, firstly I should like to say to Mr Reinfeldt that our Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will fully support the priorities of the Swedish Presidency, that is to say, the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we naturally expect to be implemented quickly and in full; the preparation for the climate-change summit in Copenhagen, which has already been mentioned and which is a priority that we fully support; and, lastly, the Stockholm Agenda.
Furthermore, and this is the subject of my speech, Mr Reinfeldt, I should like to refer to an issue that is addressed in every speech in this House - the fight against the economic and financial crisis - in order to say to you that you are assuming the leadership of the European Council at a very precise moment in time. It is a good thing that it is Sweden that is chairing the Council because you have specific experience in this area. In the 1990s Sweden experienced exactly the same economic crisis that we are experiencing now throughout Europe and the world. You have experienced a crisis in the real estate sector. In the 1990s you also experienced a financial crisis, and you resolved all these problems by directly tackling the problems in the financial sector.
We expect you, Mr Reinfeldt, to use the experience you gained in Sweden, because it was a success, unlike in Japan, which has been economically stagnant for a long time. Sweden came out of the crisis because you immediately tackled the problems in the financial sector, something which is not being done for the time being in Europe. The thinking is that the United Kingdom can nationalise the banks while others - France, in particular - can recapitalise them. In Germany, work is under way to create 'bad banks'; in the Benelux countries a bit of everything is being done at the same time. The result is that there is no single approach. The United States is stabilising its banks and eliminating the toxic products while we continue to have problems.
The second point is that we hope that you, together with the Commission, can also present a new recovery plan, because 27 different recovery plans will not produce the necessary results in the coming years. It is absolutely essential that the Council and the Commission together take the lead in this. I know there are now 27 recovery plans at national level, but we see a number of protectionist measures inside those national plans. It is your responsibility, Mr Reinfeldt, to say to your colleagues that a better way to deal with this is, together with the Commission, to devise one single recovery plan and to invest in sustainable energy and in the new economy.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, my fellow Member Mr Schulz said everything there is to say about the institutional concerns that my group has had for a long time with regard to the forthcoming election of the President of the Commission. We agree with what he said. We want the whole of the Commission and all of the top-level staff of the European Union to be elected according to the conditions of the Treaty of Lisbon and we will not give an inch on that. However, Mr Barroso, I would like to take the opportunity to explain the political reasons behind my group's doubts and its belief that you are not capable from a political point of view of doing what we feel to be necessary in the current situation in Europe.
Take, for example, the frequently mentioned need for the new regulation of financial markets. We have had G8 summits, G20 summits, extended G8 summits, European summits. How far have we come? If we look at the picture today and draw a comparison with the game of Monopoly that we are all familiar with, the banks have been re-established, they have passed 'go' and did not go to jail, they have taken hundreds of millions with public approval and then simply started the game again. I do not think that people are being doom-mongers when they say that as a result of this the next crash is inevitable. Mr Barroso, what happened to your forceful intervention? Where are your genuine results? We have seen no evidence of them.
As regards climate policy, you know that during our entire European campaign we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have advocated the Green New Deal. We are absolutely convinced that it is utterly wrong to do what you have repeatedly done in the last five years, Mr Barroso, and that is to play economic strategies off against environmental and climate strategies. We believe this to be very much rooted in the past and it must stop. We need to think about economic development in a sustainable way and we must bring climate protection targets into line with environmental targets. That will benefit the economy and will create hundreds of thousands or even millions of jobs. Mr Piebalgs has demonstrated once again that this is the case in the energy sector in his study over recent months. In our experience, Mr Barroso, you are not in a position to set forth this Green New Deal.
In summary, I can only say that, with regard to climate protection, Europeans have been conspicuous on the international stage in recent months as a result of their new-found hesitation - how far do we really want to go with the reduction targets? - and new tight-fistedness, and that, unfortunately, also applies to Sweden. The establishment of the International Climate Protection Fund for the poorer countries has gone extremely badly. The fact that it is still a secret that the Swedes want to take money from the development pots, for example, to put into this climate protection pot - that is a zero sum game and, from the point of view of the poorer countries, it is totally unacceptable. We must quickly put an end to this new tight-fistedness and new hesitancy in the European Union.
Finally, Mr Reinfeldt, I can say something positive. We are prepared to tussle with you over the new definition of the Lisbon strategy and to work with you on this. You have said you will do this by the end of the year. We will help you in this. We will also support you if you wish to do more with regard to Eastern Europe and Russia, but the focus on a genuine climate policy must not merely be a matter of headlines, it must also be corrected in the small print of the Swedish programme.
The European Conservatives and Reformists Group listened carefully to your speech, Prime Minister, and I am glad to be able to say that we share your views on very many matters. I consider your announcement of active measures to tackle the crisis to be especially important. The economic crisis, which is the worst crisis our civilisation has experienced since the 1930s, is causing unjustified anxiety throughout Europe - in poorer countries and in richer, in countries of the north and of the south. I am glad that you have announced an active fight against this crisis, and I am glad that you can see priorities which we also share - more freedom for the market, less regulation, more economic freedom, greater openness to free trade. These are a recipe for the economic growth of our continent, of our European Union.
Many people believe that the crisis has been caused far away in the US and by some bankers who are said to be greedy. The heads of government in the EU Member States seem not to have had anything to do with the crisis. They are innocent parties. Those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis. I believe that transparency should also include talking about the failures of policy that contributed to the crisis and also of course about the bankers. Transparency is in vogue in casino capitalism.
The Swedish Presidency wants to further harmonise asylum law and make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers. Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy. This is a good thing in our view, but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars. Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place.
The Swedish Presidency is focussing on more inclusive labour markets to create full employment and therefore wants to initiate labour market reforms and gender equality measures. We too are in favour of a strategy for good work practices which will support wage increases and introduce a statutory minimum wage across the board in all 27 countries. We want to see the EU agree on targets for the minimum wage set at a level of at least 60% of the national average wage in order to prevent people falling into poverty despite having gainful employment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciated the fact that the Swedish Presidency emphasised issues that concern our fellow citizens, our electorate, namely the environment and climate change, the financial crisis, the safeguarding of jobs and the fight against crime, because, in order to do a good job, we need to be in harmony with those who voted for us. We are no better or worse than our electorate, but I do believe that it is important to act in accordance with what they are asking of us, and these points seem to me to be along the lines that I mentioned.
We must overcome the crisis of confidence that undoubtedly exists. The poor turnout at the elections of this Parliament is a symptom of this, and to overcome it, we must act fully in accordance with the will of our electorate. We must also perhaps avoid making comparisons: your country borders Norway; I live near Switzerland. They are outside the European Union, but they live well all the same; they have the same problems, but they are no worse off than us, and here it is important to see and to demonstrate that it is worth having the European Union.
Mr President, this Parliament spends its time regulating matters that should be determined in the Member States themselves. As far as our party is concerned, the European Union should only be involved in matters relating to economic and monetary cooperation. It is with Dutch interests to the fore that we will keep our eyes on the Swedish Presidency, as it is doing nothing for Dutch citizens. You want to just press ahead with the European Constitution, which Dutch voters rejected and which is 99% identical to the Treaty of Lisbon. You also fail to do anything about the immensely costly monthly relocation from Brussels to Strasbourg. What is more, you have not even put the matter on the agenda. Why not? It costs thousands of millions of euros and the only people who like the idea are perhaps those at Ikea, who get the chance to sell moving boxes and extra cupboards.
We also want to see the negotiations with Turkey brought to an immediate end. Turkey is an Islamic country and the Islamic ideology is completely at odds with our Western culture. Turkey is, furthermore, absolutely not a European country, but an Asian one, while Turkish membership would cost Dutch citizens sacks full of money yet again. Turkey can be a good neighbour, but it does not belong within the European family. The Party for Freedom stands for a Europe of sovereign states, but further building work towards a federal superstate where the Member States get to determine less and less of their own affairs is taking place under the Swedish Presidency. We therefore hope that the people of Ireland will have the courage to vote 'no', once again, to the Treaty of Lisbon. The Irish population has the opportunity, here, to act as the voice of the people of Europe, and I would like to ask you, on behalf of the Party for Freedom, what conclusions the Swedish Presidency will draw from the result of the Irish referendum.
I very much welcomed the dialogue that we have had and the consultations which I was asked to introduce by the European Council during the month of June. This was done by EU Minister Cecilia Malmström. I also did it myself, both through telephone contacts and at the meeting that we had on a boat in the archipelago as we moved through the waters of Stockholm, sitting and discussing the situation that had arisen. I had been asked to investigate the possibility of electing José Manuel Barroso, appointed by the European Council, as president of the Commission for a second period of office.
A number of the matters that you touched upon are the main issues that I want to work on during the Swedish Presidency. Let me say that we are putting jobs first. We want to see a Europe in which more people have work. The discussion must start from how we achieve this. Just as Joseph Daul pointed out, I believe it is a matter of innovation and training; in other words, the things that basically drive enterprise and make people employable. I believe that Martin Schulz is right that we must be wary of ending up a Europe in which we compete on the basis of poor terms. We are having this discussion in Sweden, and it is also taking place around Europe. Having low or no pay is not a good starting point from which to try to face the competition; rather, it is only with good conditions that we can face the competition of the future.
Allow me to mention some other things that I believe are very important for steering Europe through the crisis. I have seen how the Commission - and I myself think this is important - has managed to defend the principle of the internal market at a time when many are attempting to compromise it and bring in protectionism. It is very easy to listen to those who are saying 'Why did you not save the jobs in this particular country?' without seeing the consequences of this if everyone acted in this way. If we did, we would basically extinguish free trade and the opportunity for cross-border trade. That which has basically created wealth and prosperity would very quickly be lost had we not resisted the call for protectionism. I believe that safeguarding the internal market and free movement is an important starting point for securing jobs.
Just as Martin Schultz, Rebecca Harms and Joseph Daul mentioned, I believe that this is also an opportunity to combat this with a green trend, to bring about the low emission economies that we are talking about all over the world as another way of getting out of the crisis. How we manage financing and how we invest are important. I also want to say - I agree with Guy Verhofstadt on this point - that the Swedish experience of crisis management in the 1990s was that it can only be done by keeping a grip on public finances. I have learnt that when deficits are large and rationalisation is called for, it is people with small margins and those that are most dependent on welfare institutions who are left behind. Consequently, a policy that is prudent with public finances is a good policy for people who are poor or living on small margins.
I want to tell Rebecca Harms that it is unusual for us in Sweden to be criticised for our aid commitments. The average spent in Europe on such commitments is 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product. Sweden is fairly unique in that one per cent of our gross domestic product goes to development aid. For me, these matters are related. We carried out our own review under the leadership of our aid minister within the framework of the UN's initiatives. During this we analysed precisely how we need to bear climate change in mind in our development work. You cannot carry on development work without at the same time looking at climate change and how it is already affecting poor parts of the earth. Consequently, we cannot separate these issues and say that this is development policy and that is climate policy - rather they are related and have to work together.
Where the Treaty is concerned, I would like to say to Martin Schulz that my role is to ensure that there is effective European leadership in a difficult period. We must be able to give answers to the citizens who want to see us take action to combat the financial crisis and on climate issues. We are all politically active and know that in the political domain, when we are inward-looking and discuss names and leadership our citizens perceive this as us having turned our backs on them. We are looking inwards.
Therefore I will do what I can in my role. I have been tasked by the European Council with ensuring that our cooperation and our respect for the integrity of the European Parliament are united by clarity - whether under the Treaty of Nice or the Treaty of Lisbon - in our nomination of a candidate to the post of Commission President. Where José Manuel Barroso is concerned, it is important to state that he was unanimously supported in the European Council, that he was well known as a candidate and had already been introduced to the electorate prior to the election. Naturally, that made it easier for me to act - naturally respecting the fact that the European Parliament will be given opportunity, when you feel ready to make a decision, to say yes or no to the candidate nominated by the European Council. Meanwhile there is time for discussions, which I know José Manuel Barroso has also stated, and to have this type of dialogue concerning how European policy is to develop in the years ahead. I hope that this can now be agreed in accordance with the agreement that has been made. It is what the electorate of Europe now expects, and will enable us to act together with strength.
That being said, we are going to have - I hope - the Treaty of Lisbon. The necessary adjustments will have to be made as regards the composition of Parliament, which will no longer be the same with the Treaty of Lisbon, since there will be certain changes, and the same will have to be done for the Commission. Nonetheless, the European Council adhered to every aspect of your report - the Dehaene report - which was adopted by an overwhelming majority. On the subject of the European Council, before formalising its decision, it carried out consultations, which also took into account - and this is a real first - the result of the European elections, not to mention the fact that there had been a candidate supported by a political force.
Furthermore, in view of the economic and financial crisis - and I believe that those who are in favour of a strong Europe and who want a strong Commission will no doubt agree - the matter of Presidency of the Commission should not be left unresolved now pending the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we all want - at least the majority of us do - when we do not know when that treaty will come into force. Leaving the European Commission and its Presidency in a state of suspense when there is an economic crisis, a financial crisis and a social crisis, and when we have very important negotiations ahead of us in Copenhagen, does not seem very wise to me. Be that as it may, it is up to the European Parliament to decide, and I am ready to enter into a democratic debate as, in fact, I did five years ago.
The European Commission proposed more, but that was what our Member States accepted. I want to draw your attention to the fact that some Member States - no less influential at the beginning of this crisis - suggested not to have a coordination plan. Some others suggested a fiscal stimulus of 1%, and the European Commission came immediately to the proposal of 1.5%, and in fact the automatic stabilisers were around 5%. Apart from that, we took those important decisions in terms of balance-of-payment support to some non-euro-area members and also some initiatives at global level.
So you may count on the Commission to do everything we can do to reinforce the European level and a common approach, let us have no ambiguity about it. But, also, let us be honest with ourselves: we are not the United States of America - we are not an integrated nation state - so of course we have different situations. You cannot ask Germany and Latvia to do the same thing. We have countries in Europe that are under balance-of-payment support, so of course we cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach. We have to have a common approach but with specific national responses, because that is the reality we are facing in European and will face in the near future.
We have mainly national budgets. So I share your approach to have a more coordinated European plan, namely to get out of this crisis and to build this kind of smart green growth we want; but at the same time we have to accept that we have 27 national budgets, we have 27 finance ministers, we have 27 national banks apart from our European Central Bank, and it is very important to reinforce the euro and to have economic policies and financial policies that are sustainable. If not, we will put the euro, one of the great successes of European integration, at risk.
In this area Mr Reinfeldt's party - contrary to what has been said here earlier - comes with some hefty historical domestic policy baggage. The last conservative Swedish Government led Sweden into economic disintegration, and it was a social democratic government that had to devote 10 years to sorting out our public finances. However, we cannot allow old shortcomings in domestic policy to set the agenda for the whole of the EU at a time of serious crisis. What is needed is major investments in jobs, training and green change - not putting anorexic economies on a diet by means of budgetary discipline.
John Monks, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has also expressed concern that the social dimension of the Swedish Presidency has been given such low priority. Mostly fine words, says Mr Monks, very little in the way of real plans. My group shares these concerns, and they also include the trade union rights of workers, as Martin Schulz stated in his speech. Workers' terms have deteriorated following the Laval judgment and following the Viking, Rüffert and Luxembourg judgments. Their rights have been weakened.
(FR) Mr President, we are faced with two issues. The first issue is the crisis. As everyone knows, we need a consistent and common response to the economic and social crisis and thus a European recovery plan to increase investments and to support employment. Europe really must show today that it is more attentive and closer to our fellow citizens when it comes to the difficulties they are facing. It must do more to help those who are affected by the crisis. From that perspective, the situation is urgent.
In addition to these two major issues there is a democratic requirement that concerns the process for which you, the Swedish Presidency, are responsible. Cecilia Malmström - whom I am pleased to welcome today - knows better than anyone that there are some very important differences between the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon where the appointment procedure is concerned: a simple majority on one hand, and a qualified majority on the other; an appointment on one hand, and a nomination on the other; and a different number of commissioners depending on the treaty. For my part I am really asking you to ensure that the spirit and the letter of the treaties are respected. This falls under your remit, and it is very important for the credibility of our institutions. Thank you in advance.
(SV) Mr President, congratulations on your appointment. I would first like to commend the government for having a genuine commitment to the Baltic Sea and I hope that we will make progress here. You also have remarkably good rhetoric on climate change. What I am now looking for, of course, is for this rhetoric to be put into practice. You often say that Europe and Sweden account for only a small part of the world's emissions, but if the EU Member States are home to just eight per cent of the world's population and account for 30 per cent of emissions, then it is also our responsibility to take a large part of the climate work seriously. It is here that I find the concrete information lacking.
Then I would also like to bring up the Stockholm Programme and Acta. Where Acta is concerned, we must ensure that there is openness here. The German constitutional court has said that the countries must have more influence, that the parliaments must have more influence. We need openness in the Acta negotiations. We cannot move towards supervision unilaterally. The same applies to my hometown and the Stockholm Programme. Let it become a name that is associated with the EU's transition from terror paranoia to human freedoms and rights and with a strengthening of asylum law and the protection of privacy. Then we will have made progress.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for prioritising economic challenges. Whilst we have economic uncertainty, our ability to face any of our other challenges is obviously diminished. You are right to prioritise the need to restore public finances: the extraordinarily high levels of public debt pose great and long-term threats that, unless we face up to them now, may be with us for many decades. But restoring health to financial institutions is also key to regaining the confidence of consumers and returning economic growth, let alone taxpayers' money.
Politically, I naturally share the Presidency's opinion of the two major crises - the economic crisis and the climate crisis - and of course these are the priority issues. However, where is the analysis? The economic crisis and the climate crisis were not predestined by fate. The crises have their origin in political decisions made. This is a positive thing, because it means that we can also solve the crises through political decisions - but I see no sign of a change to different policies from the Presidency. It is the same economic policy that takes no account of social or environmental considerations.
What I and many of our citizens are looking for in the programme is workers' rights, which have come into focus following the court rulings, and social issues, where no answers are forthcoming. Neither have we heard anything about the famous progressive equality policy. Where the Stockholm Programme is concerned, it is said that it will create security, but in practice what is emerging is a 'big brother' state that threatens personal privacy. We can never accept restrictions on asylum rights or restrictions on our rights as free citizens in this programme. We need a humane asylum and immigration policy.
Creative artists and, in particular, freelance writers, will have a role in identifying the values of this new Europe. Their uncensored imagination will be able to put the bureaucratic genie which aims to destroy democracy back in its bottle. After all, it is exciting ideas that lie behind at the birth of social change. Those who can offer visions of hope which allow them to get inside people's minds - the Swedes have been particularly good at this in the past, and in this respect I have every confidence in my former colleague Cecilia Malmström - can also inspire their interest in socio-political matters.
This is how I deliberately worded the final paragraph of my new book at the beginning of this last election campaign, which brought about major changes and which is linked to a great deal of hope that you in particular from Sweden with your great democratic tradition and transparency will now recognise the signs of the times. We are not only facing the economic crisis - and here the Swedes have shown their cleverness by largely avoiding it - but we also have to deal with a rather ominous swing to the right. I therefore firmly believe that together we democrats must stand up for genuine transparency and in particular we must stand together in the fight against the extreme right.
It is also important that these solutions do not only benefit our citizens today and tomorrow, but also provide for our children's future. It is therefore so very important to continue to build towards a sustainable economy and towards preventing climate change. It is good that you give such a high priority to this in your programme. I sincerely hope that your efforts in these areas help to bring the Member States closer together and that, in the run-up to the Copenhagen Conference, you also manage to induce the biggest players on the world stage to really play their part in finding a solution to climate change.
You mentioned that this enlargement process will be slower than many people on both sides would have wished. However, it is very important to give clear signals. What I expect from the Swedish Presidency is help in particular for the people in south eastern Europe to overcome the problems they are facing there - including the intergovernmental problems - so that they can feel hopeful that the road to Europe will not be blocked off, but that progress can continue to be made, even if it perhaps takes a little longer. However, the appropriate preparations must naturally be made by these countries.
Secondly, I would like to refer to another subject that you mentioned, namely the issue of restructuring the economy and the linking of economic policy and the environment. It has already been said that you have our full support in this. I believe that this is an important task for Europe. It is true that in this regard we are very much at the forefront, but we still have a lot to do. At the same time, unemployment is also rising. The level of unemployment that we are seeing today in Europe has not yet reached its maximum. It will, unfortunately, get even worse.
The Nordic countries in particular have a lot of good examples of an active labour market policy. We are not able, either as the EU or as individual Member States, to create jobs, but we can help people who have lost their jobs to find work again as quickly as possible. That is what we mean by a social Europe - this active labour market policy that we need in the individual Member States, which the European Union and the Council in particular must give out a clear message about. The green restructuring of the economy will ultimately result in lower, not higher, unemployment. This is what we are calling for.
Prime Minister, a few important points. You also have to convince your colleagues on the Council that protectionism is an abomination. The strength of the EU lies in its open borders and free trade. State subsidies to rescue the car industry are not the solution. The financial crisis cries out for a new global order, but the regulations must be balanced and must not be excessive. This autumn, as some here have mentioned, the EU must come a bit closer to a respectable asylum policy. The energy policy, just as some have said, requires both realism and solidarity. No new gas crises, no unilateral dependence. The Internet was an important issue in the election campaign. Here Sweden has a great responsibility to bring what is known as the Telecoms package to a successful conclusion. The rule of law must also apply in the virtual world.
The European Union must have the courage to put forward a proposal regarding not just the EU's own emission reductions, but the principle of burden-sharing, where all industrialised countries accomplish emission reductions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines. The most important thing is that we achieve the emission reduction targets for 2020. Secondly, it needs to be realised that the developing countries will not be able to adjust to a system of adequate emission limits unless we assist them financially at a completely new level, and the EU should be in a position to make proposals on that too.
(DA) Mr President, there are two things that struck me when I read the Swedish Presidency's work programme. The first thing is all the promises about how the EU will be used to create a better economy for solving climate and other problems, but there is not a single word about the problems that the EU creates - the problems that the EU has created in our labour markets, the problems that the EU has created in our fisheries sector, in our economy, in connection with the fight against crime and I could go on. This is the first key observation we can make when reading the Swedish Presidency's work programme - that the EU only represents solutions and that the EU is not a problem. This says more about the Swedish Presidency than it says about the EU. The second thing is that there is no mention of the fact that 2 October will be one of the most significant days in the entire history of the EU, and this will be during the term of the Swedish Presidency. I am, of course, referring to the second referendum. There is not a word about what the Swedish Presidency will do to ensure that the so-called guarantees that have been given to the Irish people will also be regarded as such. We have seen before how people have been deceived - deceived over referendums and deceived over democracy. What will the Swedish Presidency do to ensure that this does not happen again?
You have presented your programme and it is very ambitious. However, I would like to ask you to consider whether Sweden would have the courage to take the step, particularly after the experience of the financial market crisis, of joining the euro - especially as you said that the Stability and Growth Pact must be complied with. You, of course, have no opt-out clause like the United Kingdom and Denmark, for example, and you meet all of the conditions now. Will you have the courage during your Presidency to stabilise Europe further and become a member of the euro zone?
Prime Minister, I agree with your prioritising of climate policy and the Baltic Sea Strategy, but with regard to your programme in its written form, I have a request: please pay more attention than proposed to combating the financial market crisis. None of the other projects will have a chance if the crisis in the financial markets and in the economy is not resolved as quickly as possible. For this we need clear rules. It is not enough for the City of London once again to determine the course. We need clear rules in the social market economy, because a market economy without rules cannot operate and will not receive majority support. Therefore, you should consider once again - although we fully support your programme - whether you should not give the subject of overcoming the financial market crisis higher priority than you have done so far. Thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval.
Today the ministers are meeting in Stockholm to discuss the Stockholm Programme. What is good is that this is the strategy for the legislation that is now to be drawn up. Parts of the proposal have been long awaited. Ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights will finally take place, I hope - the rights of the child and of the victims of crime. We can make something really good come of this, but there are also downsides; namely the threat to the open society that the Stockholm Programme contains.
Threats to our open society must be fought off using the methods of the open society. Some of what is contained in the Stockholm Programme is not liberal, and neither is it humane or far-sighted. Registering our travel, the mass storage of personal details and the systematic charting of economic transactions is not liberal, nor is it tolerant or far-sighted. Let Stockholm stand for openness, freedom and tolerance, not registration, supervision and intolerance. Furthermore, I believe that our work in Strasbourg must be discontinued.
The system is broken and must be deeply reformed. Already the financial institutions are resisting the regulations we need to prevent a future meltdown. We need more integration of our social and economic and climate and energy policies, with the objective of job retention and creation with decent living and working conditions. We need a breakthrough in the climate change summit in December. We need, more than ever now, a recommitment to the Millennium Development Goals and, more immediately, Mr President-in-Office, I regret you did not call for an immediate lifting of the siege of Gaza or indicate any wish to re-energise the search for peace alongside President Obama.
As a Member from Ireland, I would like to remind the House that political irony is a trait much appreciated in Ireland. Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's Travels, once proposed to the British Government that the way of solving poverty in Ireland was to encourage us to eat our babies. Well, I do not think the historical irony of the United Kingdom Independence Party proposing to come to Ireland to campaign for the independence of the United Kingdom from the European Union will be lost on the people of Ireland as a subject for a good belly laugh. It will be something to see Mr Nigel Farage, dressed in his Union Jack and leprechaun hat, arm in arm with Gerry Adams, the former leader of the IRA, and Joe Higgins, my colleague up here in the back, calling for a 'no' vote on the Lisbon Treaty, each with their own lemming-like contradictory agendas. I am confident the Irish people will tell this particular circus what they told Libertas: get lost!
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of Estonia, one of Sweden's neighbours, with which it is connected through the Baltic Sea, I would like to draw attention to one of the Presidency's priorities, namely the Baltic Sea Strategy. The strategy that was initiated with the active participation of my Social Democrat colleague from the previous parliament, current Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, is very important for the whole of Europe, and I would like to thank the Presidency for making this a priority.
This is also a good example of how initiatives proposed by Members of Parliament can achieve concrete results. I would like to call upon the Swedish Presidency to implement the Baltic Sea Strategy, for which there is now a rare opportunity. In order to do this, we must provide funding for the currently empty budget line in the EU budget. I hope the strategy is passed in the European Council during the Swedish Presidency. There are two other areas that are important to me: as a former Minister of Finance, I consider dealing with the economic crisis and the implementation of transparency in the financial sector to be of great importance... (Speech interrupted)
(LV) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, firstly I would like to congratulate the Swedish Government on the objectives it has set out for its presidency. This is not an easy time for Europe; it is full of challenges. Of the many important priorities that Sweden has set out for its presidency, I would like to draw attention to the European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region, and particularly that part of it relating to energy market security. Joint security for Europe's energy market will not be possible so long as divided and mutually isolated markets exist in Europe, both in electricity and in gas. For historical reasons, this problem is particularly pronounced in the Baltic Sea region. In order to resolve this problem and spread the risk relating to energy supply, we need a common European Union energy policy. The foundation stones of such a policy must be not only energy efficiency and renewable resources, but also the creation of a common electricity and gas market with operational interconnections. The European Union's strategy for the Baltic Sea region is a step in the right direction. Its aim is to gradually connect up the energy markets in the region, overcoming deficiencies in interconnections and creating common market mechanisms. The legacy of the Soviet Union occupation in the Baltic Sea region is a split and partially isolated market, which increases our energy supply risk. Our challenge for the future is to change this situation, and by doing so boost our joint energy security. I wish the Swedish Presidency luck in making an energetic start on this important task. Thank you for your attention.
Naturally the economic crisis has been highlighted here. The big groups, the big companies always get attention. I would like to emphasise that the small loyal subcontractors should not be forgotten either when financial matters are under discussion. I would also like to underline the specific values of the Baltic Sea Strategy. I believe that the Baltic Sea Strategy could increase the legitimacy of the entire EU. Europe's largest inland sea can and must be saved. The Baltic Sea Strategy can also help to check the crime trend and trafficking. This is also an important environmental issue that you could say demands its own Copenhagen Conference.
Allow me to point out just one issue, Prime Minister Reinfeldt. It is crucial that we concentrate on one of the top priorities, namely an aggressive plan for the future of the automotive industry in the European Union. In my opinion, we have not had such a plan up to now, or at least we have had too little of one, and I think that you would agree with us there. It is definitely not too late. The rescue plan for Opel is in full swing and the world, and even Europe, is not rid of the demons of protectionism. They are slumbering beneath the surface, and Swedish society is just as affected as we in Belgium are, just as they are in France, Germany and Slovakia. We are all in the same boat.
What is needed is for us to approach this in solidarity with one another, with a coordinated, rather than an 'every man for himself' approach, and that we do not attempt to clip each others' wings. Mr President, I think that you have a unique opportunity here to work with the President of the Commission - this also sends a clear signal to the Commission - to draw up a joint plan, a joint plan, Mr Barroso, for the future of our car factories, thereby steering them into the 21st century.
(HU) In our view, Sweden is synonymous with Europe. This country is the home of prosperity, security and freedom, where the issues of human rights and freedoms are just as important as economic and climate change concerns. Then we have the parliament of an EU Member State which adopted a language law on 30 June 2009 stipulating that if anyone, including all of you, does not call that country's capital city by its name in the country's official language, Bratislava, but uses its German name, Presburg, or Hungarian name, Pozsony, they may very well end up paying a fine of EUR 5 000. The explanatory memorandum to the language law amendment states that protection of the national language in certain cases overrides the freedom of speech and right to privacy. A European Union which adopts such a law is no longer a Europe of freedom. I ask the Swedish Presidency to do its utmost to ensure that this law is repealed and that the Slovak head of state does not sign it.
(HU) I would like to draw your attention to two of the Swedish Presidency's priorities which I was delighted to see on this list. The first of these priorities is the unequivocal opposition to discrimination, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia. I think that the importance of this issue is particularly underlined by the fact that we saw how evident the level of support was for the far right in several European countries during the European Parliament elections. This therefore makes it the responsibility of every one of us, including Parliament and the current Presidency, to ensure that the most vulnerable do not end up in a precarious situation. In particular, we must do everything to ensure that there is no cooperation between those parties professing to be democratic and the extremist parties. A very good example of this is the Slovak language law, mentioned already today on several occasions, which is severely discriminatory, as was described. The second priority which I would like to welcome is the series of European measures to be adopted, aimed at the integration of Roma communities.
(PL) Mr President, continuation of enlargement of the European Union and the future of the Treaty of Lisbon are among the objectives of the Swedish Presidency. The German Constitutional Tribunal ruled recently that the Treaty of Lisbon can be accepted only on condition that the precedence of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat are safeguarded, which calls into question the idea of European federalism. The Treaty of Lisbon has, therefore, turned out to be a legal monster, which has been noticed not only by the Germans, but also by the Irish in a referendum and by the Presidents of the Czech Republic and Poland. In this context the Swedish Presidency should initiate a Europe-wide debate on the subject of the role of the national parliaments of all the 27 Member States, and should develop a new model of cooperation between sovereign European nations.
(MT) I would also like to laud Prime Minister Reinfeld for staying with us until the very end of this discussion. We will be looking to the Presidency to implement three important priorities. The first is the Stockholm Programme on the area of justice, freedom and security. We have to ensure that agreement is reached on this programme as soon as possible. The second priority is the implementation of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum. We will be looking to you Prime Minister to ensure that you will implement the Pact that was agreed upon last year. Thirdly, last month, during the European Council, agreement was reached regarding the pilot project on burden sharing in the field of immigration. You have a great deal of work ahead of you Prime Minister, and we, together with our President, will be monitoring you closely to guarantee that this work is carried out.
It is regrettable that the Swedish Presidency is resigning itself to the informal and disputed framework of the G20. It is tragic that the EU - this locomotive of the world according to Mr Barroso, who was citing the UN Secretary-General - is leaderless and lacking in any strategic vision in this area, at a time when President Obama is proclaiming his commitment to global governance. Instead, on our side, we have only heard the Pope insisting on the urgent need to reorganise the UN Security Council and the Bretton Woods Institutions.
In this context I would like to point out that in the next six months, we as the European Union and Sweden as the Presidency will have to face up to problems relating to the disregard of human rights in Belarus. For six months now, three entrepreneurs, Mr Avtukhowich, Mr Leonov and Mr Osipienko, have been held in detention and have not been able to obtain a just verdict. Of 12 young activists who took part in a demonstration in January 2008, 11 were given custodial sentences, and several days ago one was sentenced to a year in prison. Prime Minister, in the next six months please pay attention to the question of breaches of human rights in Belarus.
I know that you are waiting for a vote. Allow me to thank you for having represented your respective party groups very well. I note your eagerness and the expectations that there are of the Swedish Presidency, your desire for us to be more of a driving force in climate negotiations and to take action to combat the financial crisis and economic recession. You have noted our Baltic Sea Strategy, our Stockholm Programme, our continued efforts to drive forward the matter of enlargement, and I would like to thank you all for the support we are experiencing in this.
Although, in the presentation of its programme, the Swedish Presidency did refer to people and the problems of unemployment, it did not mention a single measure to change the existing policies which have caused these problems. Quite the contrary. In particular it highlighted the policy of free competition in the widest range of areas, including in services and foreign trade. It has gambled everything on the recovery of the financial markets, on the resumption of the paradigms of the Stability Pact and on the defence of neoliberalism, which will certainly result in new attacks on social and labour rights.
It also did not forget to insist on a new referendum in Ireland on the draft Treaty of Lisbon, already planned for 2 October, in a continuation of the blackmail of the Irish people in order to move forward more quickly with the destruction of public services and the reduction of social rights, including in the areas of social security, health, water, social protection and workers' rights. It is not difficult to predict that it will submit new proposals for directives, which will try to adopt the same lines as those proposals that were rejected in the previous legislative term.
I welcome the incoming Presidency and would like to express the hope that as the third member of the Council troika, Sweden will continue the work which was started during the Czech and French Presidencies in the area of Roma social integration. There were many factors which hampered the outgoing Czech Presidency's work, but the overall picture in terms of Roma issues is nevertheless positive. In fact, the Roma Platform held its first meeting in April in Prague, while, in June, the European Council strengthened its general objectives in terms of offering Roma equal opportunities by calling on the Commission and Member States to combat the poverty and social exclusion affecting Roma.
In the same document the Council adopted the common basic principles set out in Prague for achieving Roma social integration, with a call to public policy-makers to take these principles into consideration and comply with them. Based on the results achieved by the troika so far, I hope that the Swedish Presidency will at least focus greater attention than before on Roma issues. For example, I hope that the forthcoming conference on the inclusive labour market to be held in October and the Equal Opportunities Summit due to take place in November will deal with the issue of Europe's largest minority as a main priority. Indeed, in terms of population size, it is considerably larger than the population living in the Baltic region, designated as a priority by this Presidency. I also hope that the Swedish Presidency will go beyond the theoretical approaches already adopted and the organisational issues decided and start to take specific actions, thereby actually putting these frameworks into practice.
The EU is facing huge challenges nowadays: the economic and financial crisis, the alarming rise in unemployment and climate change. The unemployment rate in the EU is 8.9% at the moment, while 19% of young people under the age of 16 and 19% of elderly people are exposed to the risk of poverty. People are losing their jobs, many businesses are going bankrupt, while national budgets are in major deficit. The EU's Swedish Presidency has a huge responsibility towards its citizens. It must restore their hope of a decent living and lay the foundations for economic recovery by getting everyone to pull together. Such measures as increasing energy efficiency, using energy from renewable sources and improving the EU's energy security feature among the Swedish Presidency's priorities. I hope that the EU's Swedish Presidency will mark the start of an age of prosperity, guaranteeing a period of economic growth for the next 40-50 years. I believe that, now more than ever, we need to invest in education, research, energy efficiency and, above all, in people. Sweden is renowned for its social policies and high standard of living. This is why I would like, along with my fellow Members in the European Parliament and every citizen in Europe, to wish you every success, and we hope that this term will provide the springboard to a new future.
in writing. - (EL) The priorities of the Swedish Presidency mark an escalation in the anti-grassroots attack by the EU, the aim of which is to safeguard the ongoing profitability of euro-unifying capital by shifting the burden of the capitalist recession on to the working class and grassroots classes. The Swedish Presidency is seeking to speed up capitalist restructurings, within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. At the epicentre of this anti-labour attack are wage and pension cuts, the complete demolition of labour relations, workers' rights and social protection and insurance systems and even greater commercialisation of health and education.
I think you are all aware of the fact that the European Union has taken a very strong and a very principled stand when it comes to these events. We have reiterated that questions over the conduct of elections are issues for the Iranian authorities to truly investigate and clarify. We have also been very clear in our response to what we have seen happening on the streets of Tehran. We have condemned the crackdown, the violence and the use of force that we have seen against peaceful demonstrations; we condemn the crackdown against journalists, media outlets, communications and protestors. Those are contrary not only to the norms and values that we represent but also, obviously, to the wishes for a more open and more reform-oriented society expressed by so many Iranians.
Before concluding, let me just note one issue that has been occupying us quite a lot, and that is that the Iranian authorities did detain a number of personalities who are staff members of European missions, as well as some European nationals. We have been in constant touch with the Iranian authorities over these issues. We consider possible accusations levelled against them to be baseless, and I can assure you that we will continue to engage with the Iranian authorities in all the ways we can until these issues are resolved in a satisfactory manner - that is, that the persons in question are released.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is my first opportunity to congratulate all the honourable Members on their election to the new European Parliament. I can say, on behalf of the Commission, that we very much look forward to a constructive cooperation with you, including of course on some of the most pressing international challenges that we face, and the subject of today's debate is certainly one of those. My colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner is travelling this week and so I have offered and have been delighted to be able to speak on her behalf in Parliament today.
We fully endorse the statements and positions taken so far by the Presidency, Council and Commission, but we are also asking the Council to ensure that EU Member States and their ambassadors in Tehran are fully complying with EU guidelines on human rights defenders and on the prevention of torture. We should also convey to the Commission our insistence that all available means should be deployed. We should support and strengthen civil society organisations in Iran, notably via the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, and deploy all efforts for renewed engagement with Iranian civil society in such uncontroversial areas as the fight against narcotraffic, refugee issues, academic exchanges, and visits to Europe by journalists, to name but a few. They could help to further people-to-people contacts and lead to improved freedom of expression in the country. Pressure on human rights, yes, but no isolation! Dialogue, even if a very difficult dialogue.
We are going through a very difficult and tense period with Iran. The crucial nuclear question is on hold, and we ask the question: what is the way forward? Well, sanctions are one possible measure being explored. We really believe the Union must find a way to re-engage in dialogue with Iran on all these issues. The need to find ways of building fresh trust and to create a strong diplomatic process has never been greater than now. We should offer our full support to the Council and the Commission in their efforts. In turn, we, the European Parliament, must continue with our efforts to strengthen the parliamentary diplomacy aspect of our relations with Iran through our strengthened links with the Majlis.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, whatever people feel about the outcome of the Iranian elections, there is no doubt that tens - hundreds - of people have been injured, tens of people have been killed in the protests that have taken place since the elections in that country, and thousands of people appear to have been detained as political prisoners. This entire Chamber should therefore have no hesitation in condemning those abuses of human rights, as it should condemn the obstructions to free journalism that have taken place since the elections.
We should also, as Mr Saryusz-Wolski mentioned concerning the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week, recognise that one of the best ways of determining a free and fair election is to invite election monitors to observe the process, and this European Union has got a fine record of doing that. We should note in this Chamber today that the Commission on our behalf did not have the confidence that they could do an independent, fair and objective job and therefore we have proper reason to say that we have no confidence in the election results.
Our hearts go out to the Iranians who have been injured, detained or had their human rights abused. Our thoughts are foremost with them, but I also ask this Chamber not to forget the Iranian who was an employee of the British Embassy. He has been detained and is charged in a completely unjustified way with fomenting the protests. Our hearts go out too to the French student who was detained by the Iranian authorities. We should praise our colleagues in the Swedish Presidency who have stood by those countries and who have ensured concerted action by the European Union in response and ask them to continue it.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Iran is a large country with a large and predominantly young population, a long and eventful history and an impressive culture. What is more, Iran is located in one of the most sensitive areas on the planet. For all these reasons, but also out of compassion for our fellow human beings, let us not be indifferent to the goings-on in Iran. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is not in favour of regime change by force. We do believe, however, that all the peoples of the world, including the Iranian people, must be entitled to choose their own leaders and to replace them when they cease to make the grade.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission, a regime that turns on its own people and its own youth in this way loses all legitimacy, not just at home, but internationally as well. It is therefore particularly tragic that these dramatic developments should take place at a time when the president of the United States has expressed his willingness to enter into dialogue with Iran. Iran is on the verge of missing a historic opportunity to take the place on the world stage that its history and culture deserve.
Therefore, Europe must raise its voice. I know that it is difficult to strike a balance between the interests and the protection of the Iranian people and our own interests, which are not always identical. However, even if it is complicated, it is important to stress that we show solidarity towards the Iranian people every day. I call on the Commission and the Council to analyse the part played by Nokia and Siemens and the responsibility of European weapons in the repression of the Iranian people. It is, after all, unthinkable that it should be large European companies that have enabled the Iranian Government to suppress the freedom and the desire for freedom of the Iranian people.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, while we sit here debating the recent uprising in Iran, do we realise that over 50 of the student leaders, the protestors who were arrested, have been taken out and hanged by the Iranian authorities, that over 200 people were killed on the streets, including Neda, who has become an international and very potent symbol of the brutality of that fascist regime against the people of Iran? And, while we continue to enjoy our place as the biggest trading partner with the Iranian Government, do we seriously think that money is more important than lives?
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left is deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in Iran. We, too, condemn in the strongest possible terms the brutal mistreatment of demonstrators. We are extremely concerned about the fate of numerous people who were detained and call for their immediate release and we also believe that the European Parliament as a whole should do this.
We are also critical of comments in media and governmental circles in other states which exploit the legitimate protests of the Iranian citizens. Not even the most recent developments in Iran justify plans for military action against Iranian nuclear installations. My group rejects such strategies. We therefore welcome the clear statement by President Obama, who has refused to give Israel the green light for an attack on Iran. The US President also believes in diplomacy. Iran is a sovereign state. Its people alone have the right to decide on changes to its society. The government of a sovereign state must openly accept the desire for change and drive through a political solution.
On 23 October 2006, there was a major demonstration with about 100 000 people in commemoration of the 1956 revolution. This was organised by the largest opposition party, Fidesz, which is well represented here in the EPP, and basically they won the elections this year in Hungary. It was a middle-class crowd of families, elderly people, children, and the brutal Hungarian police brutally attacked this crowd with tear gas, with rubber bullets, with policemen on horseback, causing severe injuries to several hundred people. On the same occasion several hundred people were illegally detained and tortured in prison.
(DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has discussed the violations of human rights by Iran on many occasions and we are, in fact, doing so again today. We will not change the appalling behaviour of the dictators by words alone. It is time for tangible action. The brutal slaughter of a people who hunger after freedom and who have courageously taken to the streets must cause us to take on some of the responsibility for bringing down this criminal regime. This regime has no place in the 21st century. European governments must report the Iranian regime to the UN Security Council and demand that the perpetrators, primarily Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, be brought before an international court.
I trust that no ECR Group members here will be hypocritical enough to condemn Iran for the use of violence in elections when David Cameron is among the sponsors of Unite Against Fascism, an organisation of far-left criminals which routinely deploys intimidation and violence against nationalist dissidents in Britain. The same is true of five current Labour, Lib Dem and Tory MEPs, marked with the shame of supporting the use of British taxpayers' money to support their own militia, which breaks up opposition meetings and attacks their opponents with bricks, darts and claw hammers.
But my main point is this: however well meaning, and even justified, criticisms of Iran made here may be, they will be exploited as war propaganda by the powerful vested interests that stand to gain from a military attack on that country. Neocons, oil companies, construction corporations and the Wahabi mullahs of Saudi Arabia all want to see the sovereign state of Iran destroyed by an aggressive war. Not even European liberals are naive enough to fall for lies about weapons of mass destruction again, so human rights are being drafted in as a new casus belli.
Do not add the voice of this place to the warmongers' chorus for a third illegal and counterproductive attack by the West on the Muslim world. Or, if you must, do not leave the war - which hypocritical rhetoric will help to justify and unleash - to the usual brave British cannon fodder: 18-year-old boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne. Instead, send your own sons to come home in boxes or without their legs, their arms and their sanity - or mind your own business.
(PL) Mr President, the death of innocent people is always a tragedy. If, however, they die in defence of values such as freedom or truth, we can say that their suffering is not in vain - as is the case with the recent victims in Iran. Things have become very bad, when a regime shoots at demonstrators, puts opponents in prison, and tortures and kills them. The only source of hope and optimism is that these events may make politicians and public opinion across the world aware of the true nature of the Iranian regime, which is capable of actions which are very far removed from the minimum standards of the modern world. This regime has blood on its hands. We should remember this, and we should work towards changing a state of affairs which we cannot accept. In situations like this the same question always comes up: what can we do? Well, we can support the demands and proposals which have already been expressed.
However, while it is true that Iran is a theocracy in which fundamentalism has shaped its plan to wield power by pretending that it is in the name of God, in recent days we have also seen people take to the streets and actually cry out 'God is great'. What a difference! This difference in looks, in the will that these people have expressed, and in the determination not to be violent, makes us realise that, in Iran, the love of freedom and of truth, the love for one's own people, and the love and regard for everyone is not dead.
Thirty years of theocracy, thirty years of systematic human destruction have not been enough to wipe out this memory that is in the hearts of each of us. It is to this that we owe loyalty. It is to this fact, to this love of truth and to this love of freedom that we owe our unconditional devotion, and it is this that should heighten the responsibility of everyone, because asking the European institutions to be strong, to be determined and to make their voices heard is, first and foremost, not a demand by Parliament for geopolitical prominence, it is pointing out that, insofar as it represents this political project that we call united Europe, the love of freedom and of truth that exists in all of those who demonstrated in recent days must not be forsaken by Europe's institutions.
The EU governments have been too hesitant in condemning these atrocious crimes and to make the regime bear responsibility for its behaviour. If we are serious about protecting the rights of Iranian citizens, we need to be prepared to cause the dictators real pain. What does this mean? We should, for example, ban any of the leaders of the regime from travelling to the EU; we should recall our ambassadors from Iran as a gesture of our indignation; and free elections can take place in Iran only under UN supervision.
(PL) Mr President, it certainly is necessary to monitor the progress of the electoral process in Iran, although the beginning of a solution to the conflict should be a declaration by the authorities in Iran that they will stop using force, and that they will free the imprisoned opposition activists, defenders of human rights, journalists, demonstrators and citizens of other countries who are currently being blamed for the situation which exists in Iran. We should, of course, uphold absolute respect for the sovereignty of Iran, but we should also remind Tehran that it is obliged to observe the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
I also agree with this description - it most certainly was a sham election, which, with large-scale electoral fraud, robbed the majority of Iranian people, who had called for change, of this right. President-in-Office of the Council there is one thing in particular that interests me: in the middle of August the inauguration of the 're-elected' Mr Ahmadinejad will take place. What is currently being discussed in the Council and also in the Member States? Will the European Union and the Member States be officially represented at this inauguration? I certainly hope not, as I do not think that there should be any official representation of the European Union or the Member States after this election sham, and as much as I would advocate further dialogue, no one should officially represent the European Union at this inauguration. What is your position on this? How is it currently being dealt with?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating foreign policy issues, such as today's issue involving Iran, there is always the risk, as we know, of lagging slightly behind the events taking place. However, there is no doubt that the European Parliament, if it wants to, can play an important role in urging Europe and the international community to take the current events seriously and to implement all of the initiatives needed to ensure that the process of introducing a democratic system in Iran can actually take place.
Following the close attention paid by the international public to the post-election period in Iran and the street demonstrations that the Iranian regime sought to repress with the use of violence, it is important to ensure that silence does not descend on the situation in the country. Being realistic about things does not mean taking the Iran issue off the agenda. It is also up to us to keep this level of attention high, and it is also up to the Swedish Presidency - which I thank for the points it has made today - to promote a strong initiative, together with the United States, Russia and other countries, in order to change the way in which issues in Iran, from democratic rights to the nuclear issue itself, develop.
Mr President, when it comes to Iran I have the following points to make. First of all, the Iranian regime is unpredictable. Secondly, I note that there are, in fact, hairline cracks beginning to appear in the regime, specifically in religious circles. Thirdly, it is my observation that the regime supports everything that is bad or involves corruption in this world - be it in the Middle East or in Pakistan. Fourthly, I would point out that dialogue really does not provide any help and, finally, I note the citizens rightly want more freedom and that they must have our - Europeans' - support in this regard.
I hope that Europe, with the Swedish Presidency, can send out a clear message to Iran in general, indicating that the non-negotiable values of the right to life, human dignity and the freedom of choice cannot be separated from the development of bilateral relations and that, in particular, it can make it clear that the State of Israel's right to exist is non-negotiable and that Europe, which has lived through the Holocaust on its own territory, will not allow a second holocaust of the State and the people of Israel.
I think it is important also to focus on what we saw on the television screens before 12 June, because that was suddenly a somewhat different Iran from the one we were used to. There was an element within the boundaries of the regime, certainly, of vitality, an element of plurality, an obvious desire for change, for openness, for reform. Whether that represented the majority of Iranians or not is very difficult to judge from the outside, but that it was significant is testified not least by the force of the crackdown that we saw after 12 June. So in condemning what we have seen after, we should not forget what we saw before and the long-term significance of that.
The first one is fairly obvious. The European Union must be the clear voice for human rights and democracy wherever and under whatever circumstances. There might be other factors coming into consideration of policy as well, but it should not dilute in any way from the consistency of our defence for human rights. So we must condemn the killings, the use of the death sentence. We must call for the release of those detained. We must be clear in our call for full respect for the freedom and the rights that are there for every human being in our world.
Secondly - and I think here there might be some dissent - we must also be prepared to engage. I say that, recognising that that is a far more difficult policy than just to stand back, do nothing or try to isolate: that is easy; to engage is difficult. Mr Kelam alluded to some of the historical experience we have, with the balancing act that that entails. But the fact that we have a certain amount of historical experience in Europe - reflected not the least here - perhaps makes it possible for us to venture along that particular road.
This is obviously going to be more demanding and more difficult in the circumstances that we now have, there is no question about that, and I think the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week highlighted some of the difficult choices and some of the difficult judgements that we have to make in not only the coming weeks, but months - but not very much longer than that. Here we must engage - you, us in the Council and us as Europeans - with other significant international actors, not only with Americans with a new and good approach by the Obama Administration, but also engage with others - the UN Security Council, Russia, China, and with the wider world community. It is only then that we can hope to be able to start resolving not only the immediate issues, but also the other issues that need to be addressed.
I am grateful for this debate. I think it has highlighted the clear unanimity that we have when it comes to defending our values, but it has also highlighted some of the difficult choices and balancing acts that we have to engage in in the months and years ahead. We know what we want to achieve; we must also seek to achieve it. But do not think it is going to be easy. I can assure you that the Council will continue to be very much engaged with all aspects of this particular dossier.
We very much welcome the recent effort by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, to try to reconcile the differences that exist. So far that has proved to be - hardly surprising, one might say - a somewhat difficult enterprise. But I am encouraged by the news that there will be new meetings under the chairmanship of President Arias this Saturday. We can only encourage him to move forward with those efforts and we can only continue to urge both sides to be ready to compromise, fully respecting every part of the constitution of Honduras.
Mr President, on this basis I have to say that the observation made by a number of esteemed analysts, such as Mario Vargas Llosa, is in any case highly significant: the most conspicuous defenders of the deposed President Zelaya - who, by the way, has won support from all the various political parties, including his own, and the Supreme Court of Justice against the National Congress of the Republic - have in fact been representatives of regimes characterised by a systematic violation of human rights and by a progressive decline in individual freedoms, as this Parliament recognised in the last report on the human rights situation in the world.
Therefore, we cannot accept this situation. The European Union and the Member States have done the right thing in recalling their ambassadors, cancelling all forms of cooperation and suspending negotiations with the region. I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission that we must now support a negotiated settlement led by the Social Democrat President of Costa Rica, Óscar Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, and not provoke any repressive or insurrectional violence.
That said, I agree, and my group agrees, with the need for an outright rejection of the coup - for we should call it by its real name - that has taken place in Honduras. Some may consider it a mistake to have tried to consult the will of the people, perhaps above all else; but we are not here to analyse that. I also agree that both the Commission and the Council have to work to facilitate the restoration of the constitutional and institutional order that has been overturned and to ensure the return of the Honduran President, who was legitimately elected by all the people.
I have been following the situation in the country and the region in the last few years in my role as Vice-Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America; it is particularly significant for me and of the utmost importance that we are discussing this matter on the first day of political debate in this House. That fact shows that this is a fundamental issue: the event has the sad and regrettable honour of being considered the first coup d'état in a Central American country in the 21st century, and that is something we should not forget.
Therefore, I not only strongly condemn the coup d'état against President Zelaya, but I also urge the European Union not to recognise the coup leader, Roberto Micheletti. Furthermore, I believe it is vital that the European Union insists, as it is in fact already doing, that constitutional order be restored. It is crucial that the November 2009 elections should be prepared in a serious, responsible and credible manner and, with that in mind, I am also pleased that talks aimed at forming an association agreement with the region have been suspended, at least for the time being.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, four days after the coup, my parliamentary group decided to send me to Tegucigalpa to observe in situ the consequences of this military coup, this coup d'état. In Tegucigalpa, I was able to witness the consequences of any military coup, namely: repression; a lack of freedom; arrest warrants issued against members of parliament who did not support the coup; leaders of social groups imprisoned; and hospitals, with many injured people, taking advantage of the curfew. That was the detailed picture I gained there.
I welcome the response issued by the Council and the European Commission, for that is the only possible response. Firstly, all the requirements issued by the Organization of American States must be met. May I state here that, in the meeting I had with the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, I found that they are very clear on this matter: any action carried out by the illegitimate government of the coup leader, Roberto Micheletti, will be declared null and void and, therefore, the Organization of American States has already decided that it is not going to observe any kind of election held by that government.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining with the previous speakers in condemning in the harshest possible terms the coup d'état staged against the government of President Zelaya in Honduras. His arbitrary detention and his expulsion from the country are in breach of the constitutional order, which must be restored as quickly as possible. The military overthrow that led to Roberto Micheletti proclaiming himself as the new president brings to mind the darkest periods in the history of Central America that we have known, and this attack on democracy is unacceptable in our view.
However, I am also very concerned, Commissioner, about the commercial relations that the European Union maintains with this country. For several months negotiations have been taking place between the European Commission and Central America on a new-generation association agreement. Following the coup d'état, meetings planned last week have been cancelled. We should be glad about that. I thought I understood you, but I should like to have more details. Is the Commission determined to suspend the negotiations until the institutional political situation in Honduras has returned to normal? That is what I and my political group are asking, but I should like to have more details concerning the Commission's position on this point.
Another issue that I wish to raise, Commissioner, is that of the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, from which Honduras benefits. Several organisations from civil society have reported arbitrary decisions and human rights violations since the coup d'état, particularly as regards freedom of movement, association and expression. The European Commission has to be very firm on this issue. The GSP+ is an incentive, the benefits of which are dependent on clear commitments. The testimonies are more than enough to cast doubt on whether the State of Honduras is fulfilling its commitments under its self-proclaimed president. I therefore call on the Commission to launch an investigation into the possibility of temporarily withholding the preferences granted to Honduras under the GSP+.
Following the unanimous decisions of the UN and of all the regional cooperation organisations, Europe must play its part in this fight, since it is a fight, not an arrangement. It is a historic fight. Europe must break off all relations of all kinds - political, commercial - and all negotiations with the factious regime until the time of President Zelaya's unconditional and non-negotiable return to power, since there is nothing to negotiate where democracy is concerned. Europe must call on the Obama Administration and on the United States to break off their commercial and military relations with the factious regime, too. This is the price at which we will prove equal to the principles that we so often claim to observe in order to criticise those of others.
We must consider the enormous progress and democratic changes made over recent years in a series of countries, changes which strengthen constitutional and democratic freedoms, which defend the concept and essence of policy against the uncontrolled position of the market trying to oust it and which break the long-standing bonds of neo-colonialism. That is why I believe that we should consider the huge responsibility of Europe for peaceful action at international level and restore democratic ties and ties of solidarity with the peoples and countries on the other side of the Atlantic.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I think all of those who have spoken have spoken very much in strong terms in favour of the defence of democracy and constitutional order throughout Latin America. In that, of course, there is a condemnation of what happened. Whatever the background, we do not send in the military to arrest the elected president of a country and send him abroad. Irrespective of the background, we must be very clear on this; we are very clear on this.
But then, in order to resolve the situation, there must be some sort of accommodation, some sort of compromise. Judging from what I have heard from Mr Salafranca and others, everyone agrees that President Arias is probably the man best suited to achieve that particular compromise. He will probably have to spend quite some time in negotiating with representatives of both the parties but I think it is important that he has our support as well as the support of the other American states for these particular efforts.
Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit discussed a motion put forward by my group in the Conference of Presidents last week. We put forward the motion in question as we believe that it is not really the issue of the Irish referendum, nor the issue of the Constitutional Court in Prague, but the issue of the lack of cohesion in the opinions of the Council that is responsible for the confusion currently prevalent. It is abundantly clear that a community based on law - and the European Union claims to be just that - must act in accordance with applicable law. The applicable law is the Treaty of Nice. There is therefore no alternative to working with the Treaty of Nice, and that means working with the President of the Commission and all the Commissioners.
The Council wants to elect the President on the basis of the Treaty of Nice but to then do what Mr Cohn-Bendit referred to, namely to apply the Treaty of Lisbon to Commissioners, which would mean that we would have a President of the Commission elected on a different legal basis than his Commissioners - which, by the way, is something the President of the Commission himself thinks is very regrettable. That is why he is going around talking of the Lisbon majority that he needs but will not get.
Since, today, we have the Treaty of Nice in the European Parliament, we call for that Treaty to be applied until the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force. I would also ask that, until we are able to vote again on Mr Barroso, we abide by the rules to the very end. Parliament must be ready to function under the Treaty of Lisbon and, then, we will be able to vote on Mr Barroso and the Treaty of Lisbon, Mr Cohn-Bendit. Otherwise, we will not be consistent. That is what I wished to say to you.
In order to have a Commission - and I am going to request this tomorrow - I would ask that, after the referendum of 2 October, we put in place a Commission on the basis of the Treaty that exists, that is, Nice. We will debate the Treaty of Lisbon when the time comes, when Mr Cohn-Bendit has convinced Mr Klaus to sign - and as he is willing to do so, he will do so very quickly. We will place Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon, and then we will elect our President of the Commission under the Treaty of Lisbon, because, if we want to be consistent, we have to be so from start to finish. What we need now is a Commission that functions in the recession, a Commission that functions under Copenhagen. However, as you know, there is still a long way to go before all of the commissioners and the Commission are up and running.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution approving the nomination of Mr Algirdas Šemeta as a member of the European Commission. I question, however, the legal aspects of this decision. Indeed, pursuant to Article 215(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which lays down the rules in the event of a commissioner resigning, it is the Council which, acting by qualified majority, appoints the substitute commissioner. As I see it, the European Parliament does not have any power in this particular case, and its Rules of Procedure, paragraph 2(2) of Annex XVII of which stipulates a vote by secret ballot, are not in line with the Treaty. This stipulation of the Rules of Procedure is certainly imperative for the European Parliament, but not for a properly appointed commissioner. Article 214(2) of the EC Treaty, curiously mentioned as the legal basis of the resolution, concerns not the nomination of a commissioner in the event of a resignation, but the vote to approve the entire Commission as a college. It is also strange to see this resolution adopted on the basis of Rule 106(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which concerns the election of the entire Commission and not the replacement of a commissioner.
I voted in favour of Mr Šemeta, whom I would like to congratulate on the appointment he has been given, and I wish him every success. However, I cannot but express my concern - yet again, because I have also done this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - about the suggestion made by him that part of the funds required to finance the European economic recovery plan should be obtained through reducing the funds earmarked for direct aid to the agricultural sector. I hope that this was just a simple misunderstanding and that such a measure, which would be impossible to accept, will not be implemented.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution approving the nomination of Mr Paweł Samecki as a member of the European Commission. I question, however, the legal aspects of this decision. Indeed, pursuant to Article 215(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which lays down the rules in the event of a commissioner resigning, it is the Council which, acting by qualified majority, appoints the substitute commissioner. As I see it, the European Parliament does not have any power in this particular case, and its Rules of Procedure, paragraph 2(2) of Annex XVII of which stipulates a vote by secret ballot, are not in line with the Treaty. This stipulation of the Rules of Procedure is certainly imperative for the European Parliament, but not for a properly appointed commissioner. Article 214(2) of the EC Treaty, curiously mentioned as the legal basis of the resolution, concerns not the nomination of a commissioner in the event of a resignation, but the vote to approve the entire Commission as a college. It is also strange to see this resolution adopted on the basis of Rule 106(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which concerns the election of the entire Commission and not the replacement of a commissioner.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution approving the nomination of Mr Karel De Gucht as a member of the European Commission. I question, however, the legal aspects of this decision. Indeed, pursuant to Article 215(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which lays down the rules in the event of a commissioner resigning, it is the Council which, acting by qualified majority, appoints the substitute commissioner. As I see it, the European Parliament does not have any power in this particular case, and its Rules of Procedure, paragraph 2(2) of Annex XVII of which stipulates a vote by secret ballot, are not in line with the Treaty.

It is also strange to see this resolution adopted on the basis of Rule 106(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which concerns the election of the entire Commission and not the replacement of a commissioner.
I think it would be good if we were to seize the opportunity to tackle some of the points of criticism in this industry and perhaps still iron out some of the detrimental consequences of the free trade agreement through details here or there. I am thinking, in this regard, of key areas such as the Capital Region Act Seoul, of standards for on-board diagnostics, of environmental standards, the duty drawback protection clause, etc. We should avoid misunderstandings here or, better still, clear them up completely and, above all, press the South Koreans so that the undertakings that they have given us really are realised. Clear monitoring of potential new non-tariff barriers to trade would certainly make sense.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary. Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded. From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union.
In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far. That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha? Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union's free trade policy?
What should a trade agreement like South Korea's really contain, then? Switzerland, I believe, is a strong example. There are provisions abolishing customs duties and trade quotas on industrial and agricultural products. There are provisions to allow Swiss citizens the right to live and work in EU countries and for EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland. There are provisions for Switzerland to be part of the Schengen passport-free area. The Swiss can be in the European Environment Agency, if they wish, in the EU's film and education programmes, and they can apply for EU research grants. There is cooperation on airlines, asylum and judicial matters. In short, they have all the claimed benefits of EU membership, but without the cost.
My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs, loss of sovereignty and of resources. Even the Commission website admits 'Switzerland can develop and retain its own regulations in other areas which deviate from EU rulings. It is in its own interests, such as in financial and in labour markets.' How Britain would love to deviate in a similar way over the Working Time Directive, Temporary Workers' Directive or the new Fund Managers' Directive!
One of our core industries is not really happy with the current status of negotiations, and they have many friends in their camp, including some Member States, industries and MEPs. They all see the playing field unfairly tilted to benefit South Korea in this agreement. The European Commission and the European Council should look hard into areas of friction, namely the DDB safeguard clause, non-tariff barriers and rules of origin. If some progress could be achieved to bring more satisfaction to the EU car industry, then employment levels, strong GDP and expected standards of living would really benefit and be preserved.
However, a level playing field will not be a disadvantage. A strong precedent may be established for other FTAs waiting in line and coming up soon in the near future. It is clear to me that this agreement overall brings other benefits to the EU and to some of the EU's different industries. In the small picture, there will always be some winners and losers: it is the nature of any bilateral agreement. In the big picture, we could be close to real balance. However, with such a crucial industry as the automobile industry in a fairly unhappy mode, there is a need to try for more. Only when achieving some additional progress can we speak of a truly balanced FTA that is acceptable and has a real and positive impact as a precedent for future FTAs.
However, this time I do not share the Commissioner's enthusiasm on this issue, because too often in recent years, the Commission has taken the floor here and talked up certain initiatives, only to then pursue a different path. We are going through a particular moment in time, a major economic and financial crisis, which is also the result of a lack of reciprocity in the world, not only with developing countries - which has its own logic, its own explanation - but with the new global players and the traditional global players.
We export USD 30 billion to Korea, only USD 20 billion come back in the form of cars exported from Korea to Europe, and USD 1.5 billion will be the indirect aid that accrues to Korean cars in Europe, without mentioning the textile and other sectors. That is a definite imbalance, which I believe must be highlighted and must be corrected, before the green light is given to a free trade agreement that penalises European industry. Ours is a quality industry that has committed itself to the new requirements that innovation calls for, certainly not a bankrupt industry that cannot get to grips with the need for innovation that exists within the economy.
(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, I too am not happy about the curious changes to the agreement, such as refunds of customs charges on imported components in the case of products for export to the Union and a reduction in the 60% threshold for determining the country of origin. This amounts to favouring Korean imports at the expense of the competitiveness of European industry and at the expense of unemployment. The lion's share in this respect already goes to imported goods from Asia, where labour costs are uncompetitively low, due to poor or non-existent social and environmental standards. The trade talks should therefore have focused on raising these standards, rather than on the prosperity of Asian industry at the expense of Europe. The Commission has long owed this to the citizens of Europe.
Does the Commission have any awareness of the negative impact of the agreement on European competitiveness and on employment in the automobile and textile industries? Secondly, is it aware that the agreement sets an unfortunate precedent for future trade agreements? Thirdly, does the Commission intend to ignore the fundamental objections raised by European engineering unions? Fourthly, how is it that the Korean media are already celebrating a victory for their automobile industry when the agreement has not even been discussed by the College of the Commission? Or is the Commission prepared to revise the draft and to negotiate a balanced agreement? Does the Commission have the will to put pressure on Korea to adopt international obligations in respect of social and environmental standards and will it do so before Korea gains all of the benefits of free trade with the European Union? Thank you for your answer. I trust that common sense will prevail.
I was Parliament's rapporteur on the Korean Free Trade Agreement. In advance of this debate, I looked back on what we had decided to ask for - what we asked the Commission to go into in these negotiations and achieve on our behalf - and I actually think the Commission has achieved what we asked them to achieve. I would like to pay tribute to the chief negotiator, who I see sitting next to Baroness Ashton, and to Baroness Ashton herself, for the way they have delivered this agreement.
Clearly, in any free trade agreement - by definition - and in any negotiation, there are winners and losers, but if you look at the global impact of this agreement, there are big winners in Europe and there are big winners in Korea. Therefore, there are big winners in keeping world trade moving. At this current time, in this present crisis, anything that sends a positive signal about two units as big as Korea and as big as the European Union that we want to keep trade moving and we want to keep trade open has to be a good thing.
I have to say that, if the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers cannot move this agreement to a final signed agreement between Korea and the EU, we might as well send a note to DG Trade to stop negotiating all other free trade agreements because, if we do not deliver on Korea, forget ASEAN, forget the Gulf States, forget the whole other raft of FTAs we are trying to negotiate, and, frankly, forget Doha. This is an important agreement, where Europe has achieved its strategic objectives. Let us send a positive signal to the rest of the world that Europe is open for business and that, in the teeth of this recession, we are keen to keep our markets as open as possible.
Mr President, just very briefly, this is all new to me and I found the discussion very stimulating and educational. When Lady Ashton first spoke, I thought this was a fantastic deal for the European Union and I wondered if there were any benefits in it for Korea. Then speaker after speaker gave the opposite view, so I hope that the questions put and the points made by Mr Arif, Mr Theurer, Mr Campbell Bannerman and other speakers could be answered specifically by Lady Ashton when she replies and also she might tell us if there are any other negotiations going on right now with specific Asian countries for bilateral agreements and also how far they have progressed.
(FI) Mr President, in his speech just now, Mr Martin said that it is extremely important to conclude agreements that will speed up economic growth and employment and remove trade barriers generally, especially in this economic crisis. We have to remember, however, that today we have also just had a very serious discussion about the crisis in Europe's car industry, and this week we will also be dealing with problems in the textile industry and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid as compensation for the massive layoffs in that sector in Spain and Portugal. So, ladies and gentlemen, we have to take seriously the concern of Europeans regarding how we respond to this loss of jobs in Europe and examine what the Commission's cures actually are. Although free trade must be good for employment and economic growth at a general level, how do we prevent the loss of jobs in these traditional European industries?
I want to pay tribute to David Martin, just to begin with, for the work that he has done in the committee. It is very important that I recognise how much the Committee on International Trade has worked with me over the months that have proceeded it, and of course I am very well aware that colleagues have not had the benefit of seeing the detail of the agreement so far. So I will try and address the concerns. But, more importantly, we will make sure that we give you more and more detail, because it is important that you look at the facts rather than the assertions that will have been made.
Now, in doing so, there was a clear modus operandi, a clear approach that the Commission took which, as has been said, was supported by Parliament, by the Commission and by the Council, and that is indeed the way we have gone forward. My colleague, Mr Arif, will not mind, I think, if I say that to suggest that I would sacrifice any industry, I find alarming or perhaps a little depressing, because that is certainly not the approach that I would take.
Do I think that if you want a serious trade deal you have to recognise that actually it is a deal where both sides benefit? Yes, I do. If you want to have trade agreements, if we do believe - which I think we do - that trade is the engine that will take us out of recession, then it means you have serious, tough negotiations with industries and with countries that we care about having a deal with. Otherwise, we can just do deals all day long with countries we do not much care about, and we can open markets because we are not really interested.
Indeed, I would argue that what we have got before us is very important for all the industrial sectors. The question about duty drawback is, for me, a very simple one. Duty drawback is designed so that our response to it will prevent a particular problem. The question is, is it the only way of solving a problem? If there are other ways that equally solve the problem but, in fact, invite us to get a better trade agreement, then I will explore them. But I still want to solve the same problem, and I believe the mechanisms we have in place in this agreement do precisely that. It is not some thing that we hold up as being for ever enshrined as the only way of achieving what we want to achieve - to prevent, effectively, imports via the back door - and I believe we have resolved the problem in a different way.
So I am not going to make apologies - politically, economically or in any other way - to Parliament for having gone out and invested in negotiating this important trade deal. I make no apology for that, and I make no apology for putting forward to this Parliament what I believe is a serious, 21st century free trade agreement of enormous benefit across the economy of the European Union. I especially make no apology for doing it at a time of economic crisis because, if ever there was a time when my responsibility was to provide as much support for the businesses and the workers of Europe, I believe that time is now, and that is what this deal does.
The free trade agreement (FTA) between the European Union and South Korea, which should be concluded by mid-October, raises a number of concerns among European industries. Regarded by the European Trade Commissioner as the most ambitious ever negotiated by the EU, this agreement seemed to car manufacturers, in particular, to be very unbalanced. These manufacturers fear a massive influx of Korean vehicles on the European market as a consequence of the tariff preferences granted by the European Commission. There is no doubt that maintaining certain customs clauses such as duty drawback would be unfair and would create a distortion of competition that would be very harmful to the European car industry. This is all the more true given that the European Union's generosity does not seem to have been paid back with a lowering of the non-tariff barriers put up by the Korean authorities (import quotas on European petrol engine vehicles). The Commission therefore has a duty, from today, to review the terms of this agreement so as to restore the conditions of fair and equitable competition and to ensure the long-term survival of our industry and our jobs in Europe.
In its 8 April communication, the Commission also underlined the useful contribution of innovative funding mechanisms as a complementary and mutually reinforcing instrument with ODA. We have urged Member States to use their full tool kit and to leverage non-ODA with ODA, for example, by building on ongoing voluntary solidarity levies such as the airline ticket taxes to finance health programmes. There will be high-level discussions on this subject, including a major conference in 2010 organised by the French, which will involve the Commission upstream.
Mr President, Mr De Gucht, Mrs Joly, I am, of course, very aware that, in this type of debate, we will inevitably hear a series of speeches all saying the same thing. That does not bother me, however. I believe that it is important to repeat again and again this strong consensus that the European Parliament has a duty to build and, moreover, this needs to be done along with the Commission. This is because, despite having claimed that developing countries would be scarcely affected by the financial crisis, all the experts are in agreement today that, on the contrary, the effects of this crisis will be disastrous for most developing countries.
All the social sectors of poor countries are going to find themselves faced with a sharp rise in social needs, in particular, and in needs for services, and with a very significant fall in growth. Moreover, from this perspective, I very much appreciated your alluding, Commissioner, to the importance of responding to these needs in a far more flexible way, and I think that you know that, where it was possible to be so - obviously in the context of sufficient monitoring - I have always been a great supporter of State aid and direct aid, whether direct or sectoral aid, but of budgetary aid, in any case. I believe that there is an appropriation effect and another, far greater effect, to do with respect, and that gives the Member States powers.
The promises of the last G8 and G20 summits ultimately never made it off the page. They are amongst the promises that are trotted out again and again but that have never led to adequate, tangible assistance. In this regard, I really cannot comprehend why we are not debating Parliament's resolution before Pittsburgh in order to apply appropriate political pressure. In light of the Commissioner's accurate analyses and of Mr Michel's observations, it seems clear to me that we know what is at hand here. Yet we are not in a position to apply political pressure in order to force the Member States to finally move away from this policy of 'charity begins at home'. Looking forward to Pittsburgh, that would seem to me to be the big danger. If we do not succeed in applying pressure and making it clear that we need new institutions specifically in order to support the poorest countries in the world, then we will still be sitting here after Pittsburgh pointing out that, ultimately, nothing has changed.
The world around us teaches us not to expect too much from humanitarian appeals, especially during periods of recession. I would therefore like to draw your attention to the risk of neglecting the developing countries and of accelerating the growth in poverty and obtaining a boomerang effect in the shape of increased internal tension, bloody conflicts, humanitarian tragedies and massive migration, yet again debated by developed countries. Considering these circumstances, I believe that efforts are required in one direction to assume our responsibilities. This requires boosting international aid and the need for more efficient development aid.
I do not want to close this speech without stating my appreciation for the start of your Commission mandate. I have in mind the US-South Africa Summit, your visit to Zimbabwe at the end of this week, and the emergency assistance provided in recent days for the 100 000 victims of the floods in West Africa. At the same time, I wish to point out that not only Burkina Faso faces natural disasters, but Niger also needs international support. Human lives are not just threatened by floods, but also by the insidious and permanent threat of drought. I also appreciate that you allocated EUR 53 million last week to respond to the drought in sub-Saharan countries. These are encouraging indicators which I hope will influence the talks at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh and the Copenhagen conference, as these meetings are critical nowadays with the millennium development goals facing a major risk of failure.
(CS) Commissioner, I too would like to say how disappointed I am that the promises of the G20 concerning assistance for the poorest countries during the economic crisis were clearly not meant seriously. The reality is that IMF assistance has so far been negligible. I would also like to call for a reform of the decision-making process so that the poorest countries can have a greater say in decision making, particularly within the Bretton Woods system. At the same time, I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether it has been possible to maintain, in particular, health assistance and education in ACP countries at least at pre-crisis levels? I am asking mainly because there has been a drastic reduction in financial aid from many countries, including European ones. That said, Commissioner, I wish you success in your new role.
(FI) Mr President, it is extremely important that, at this stage, Europe shows moral leadership, and Member States must honour all their commitments as well as the Millennium Development Goals. Of course, we are suffering from relative poverty during this present economic downturn, but we need to remember that in the developing countries, they are suffering from absolute poverty, and people are dying of hunger and disease. More than 10 Member States in the Union, however, have said they will cut their development cooperation contributions or slow down the rate at which they are set to increase. Obviously, we should remember that, important as it is to increase payments, it is equally important to ensure that they are used more effectively. There are various tools in place for this coordination of aid. One is the Official Development Assistance computer program, which has been trialled very successfully in Mozambique, and I hope that there will be investment in time and effort in this type of coordination in particular. That way, it will be very easy for us to improve our success in such a situation as this, where the amount of aid available is falling.
This also means that, without additional steps by Member States to fulfil their individual targets, the collective targets for 2010 will not be achieved. The forecasted trend of a continuing increase in EU ODA relies on those Member States that are trying to respect their commitments, but efforts are required by all Member States, and I will continue to insist on that with the respective Member Sates. It is their responsibility. This is an engagement that they have taken up, and the crisis should not be an excuse to water down their engagements. I would even say, to the contrary.
Louis Michel, my predecessor, has also insisted on the flexibility, claiming that the budgetary support mechanism is the most flexible we have, and this is obviously true but, of course, this also means that we need a counterpart with the developing countries and we need to be in a position to have political dialogue with them and also monitoring mechanisms, so it presupposes a minimum cooperation on their behalf, but, once that is in place, I also believe that, especially, sectoral budgetary support is a very adequate procedure.
I do not quite understand why this resolution that has been introduced by the Committee on Development and refers to the G20 meeting of Pittsburgh is not being voted on before the G20 meeting. I do not grasp that. There will probably be one or another technical explanation for that but I think it gives the wrong signal from this newly elected Parliament that we are going to debate such a resolution after the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, which is due to happen, if I remember correctly, from 22 to 24 September, before our next meeting in Strasbourg in October.
Demographics will exert huge pressure on public finances. The challenges we face with regard to the climate will require new resources and the redistribution of existing resources. Overall, this means, in our opinion, that the budget that we are to agree on should reflect a high degree of restraint in order to leave room for future needs, with the emphasis on European added value and investments which, in the short term, can bring us out of the economic crisis and, in the long term, can also strengthen our competitiveness.
The Council's draft is balanced, while still being ambitious. Compared with the 2009 budget, our commitments have increased by 1.1% and the payment appropriations by nearly 4%. Our draft and the agreement that we want to reach must meet the following fundamental requirements, which were also applied during the Council's first reading. The budget must ensure that the EU's various political priorities for 2010 are adequately financed. We in the EU must be able to react quickly to the challenges that await us. There must be an emphasis on providing European added value. Budgetary discipline and sound economic management are required. Otherwise, we will not be able to take the gradual steps towards balancing public finances once again.
It is important to respect the ceilings. The EU must have sufficient flexibility to cope with future needs and unforeseen events. It is vital for the EU budget to have adequate margins. The draft general budget that we are tabling represents EUR 138 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 121 billion in payment appropriations. The reductions that the Council has made in relation to the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission are based on a detailed analysis of the budget implementation, the budget forecast alerts and activity declarations, and we are looking at the capacity available to implement programmes and measures. The degree of implementation and the absorption capacity have been key factors in our analysis.
I will now take a brief look at the individual headings. Sub-heading 1A, research and innovation, is the most important element, and adequate funds have been secured in our draft budget. Another area to which more resources will be directed is projects within the energy and infrastructure sectors. If we adjust for the accounting effects of the economic recovery plan, the increase in this area amounts to around 8%. Eight percent! That is a lot, and as you all know, the financing of the European Economic Recovery Plan will be one of those topics that we will need to discuss during the autumn.
As regards heading 4, it is extremely important to leave a substantial margin to the ceiling under this heading in order to be able to cope with unforeseen needs in the best possible way. The Council therefore secured a margin of around EUR 310 million in its first reading. This is particularly justified in light of the letter of amendment, which includes additional needs in this area. As regards the Emergency Aid Reserve, the Council accepted the Commission's proposal regarding commitment appropriations. The common foreign and security policy is increasing in importance and the Council will therefore ensure that adequate funds are available for this.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to have an opportunity to speak to you this morning. I know that the first stages of this budgetary procedure - in particular the July conciliation - took place in a very positive atmosphere, and I hope we can build on this cooperation in the coming weeks. We still have some way to go in the 2010 budget procedures, and there are other important issues to agree on, such as the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan, so it is crucial that all three institutions work closely together.
Turning to the actual situation following the Council's first reading and the establishment of the draft budget for 2010, the Commission acknowledges that the cuts proposed by the Council are less severe than in previous years. However, there are some particular concerns which I would like to highlight. The Commission regrets the Council's cut of EUR 1.8 billion in payment appropriations. These cuts are proportionately more significant for Headings 1A and 4, and sent a negative message in the priority areas of growth in jobs and the EU's international role, not least in relation to pre-accession assistance.
The cuts proposed to the administrative support expenditure allowance, the administrative allowance for research and the agencies are particularly harsh. Rather than taking into account the specific situation of each agency, the cuts - with few exceptions - have been general, regardless of the stage of development or tasks of the agency concerned. The cuts in administrative support expenditure will hamper the implementation of programmes, particularly in the field of research and for external actions. I am hopeful that, in preparing its first reading, Parliament will seek to redress this situation.
As announced, the Commission has now presented the budgetary authority with an amending letter to update the needs for Heading 4. The key elements of this concern: an additional EUR 95 million in commitment and EUR 60 million in payment appropriations to support the Palestinian Authority and reconstruction efforts in Gaza; and the need to consider the establishment of Bananas Accompanying Measures in view of the possible trade agreement that will affect the preferential regime of ACP banana-supplying countries. There is also an additional EUR 50 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 20 million in payment appropriations to assist developing countries in combating climate change, which should help to promote a successful outcome to the December Copenhagen Climate Change Conference.
Parliament already expressed its point of view in February. It was encouraging that the European Commission and Council expressed their agreement with it. Based on what I know about the draft, I am sad to say that the attempt to translate the fine words into the language of numbers was not a complete success. It is time to face up to the fact that no one is happy with the European Union's budget. The budget's revenue side is a serious burden for Member States, but the sum available is not sufficient for them to achieve their objectives. We are far away from achieving both full employment and a knowledge-based society. We spend large sums on agriculture, but dairy farmers, for instance, are affected by an unmanageable crisis. The biggest item on the expenditure side is the cohesion policy, but the gaps between regions are growing instead of decreasing.
Researchers born and trained in Europe are working outside the European Union. We are therefore lagging behind when it comes to innovation as well. We hoped that the crisis would also provide an opportunity for us to have a shake-up and make the European Union's budget more successful and tangible for its citizens. We also hoped to use the budget not only in compliance with the rules and without any corruption, but also to take a look at the expenses and consider which programmes actually provide value and success for our money.
What can we do now? Parliament will endeavour to shape the budget in such a way that its message will be clearer to the EU's citizens. We want to increase those items which help tackle the crisis. With this in mind, we are putting forward our thoughts on implementing the economic stimulus plan. We want to tackle head on the challenges posed by climate change as well. What we would like is for the financial crisis to be tackled effectively, not only using a couple of billion euros from the plan earmarked for this purpose, but also with every item in the budget, so that Europeans realise that the European Union is not a superfluous expense, but an effective tool for solving their problems. I call on my fellow Members, the Council and Commission to support this.
We are constantly confronted with numerous shortcomings that prevent us from using our resources in a fully efficient manner. One example of this is the security for the buildings in which we are conducting these debates today. As you know, we spend four days a month in Strasbourg. Despite this, there were security guards stationed at both entrances 365 days a year until recently. The new Secretary General of the European Parliament and his colleagues discovered this and implemented measures which will bring annual savings of more than EUR 2 million.
We have therefore asked the European Parliament administration to draw up a medium-term strategic document on buildings. We wanted to adopt a sensible decision on this matter in the first reading. There is a need to draw up a joint policy on buildings, not only in the European Parliament, but also within the framework of all institutions, and to ensure better cooperation in this area. Secretary of State, I am delighted that, like us, the Council has adopted this as a priority objective and I would like to express my thanks for that.
The second issue will be the mid-term review of the financial perspective. Between the joint decision on the multiannual financial framework taken in May 2006 and now, there has been the financial crisis, the very strong pressures on the price of energy, raw materials and even foodstuffs, and the negotiations on climate change. There has also been - I am sorry to say - the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, as is plain to see today. It is therefore a thorough review of our multiannual guidelines that we need. This will be the first task of the new Commission.
The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) is responsible for coordinating and supporting Member States' efforts to monitor and control the EU's external borders. Frontex is an important element in the EU's integrated border management strategy. Since its launch in 2005, Frontex's capacity has been progressively expanded. In line with an increased budget, Frontex now plays an even greater role in managing the operational cooperation between Member States in connection with the control of the EU's external borders.
The Agency is currently coordinating a number of joint operations and pilot projects at maritime, land and air borders with a view to combating illegal immigration, with a particular emphasis on certain high-risk areas such as the southern maritime borders of the EU, although the northern and eastern borders are also covered. In the Council, we have, on several occasions, emphasised the need to develop and strengthen Frontex. The Council's conclusions from 2008 give the political priorities for the continued development of the Agency. In the short term, it was stressed that Frontex must be allocated the necessary resources and that maximum use must be made of the equipment provided by the Member States within the framework of the Centralised Record of Available Technical Equipment (CRATE). The Council also urged Frontex to foster cooperation with other border control authorities, including customs authorities, and with third countries with regard to border control.
In the long term, it was emphasised that the future development of Frontex operations should still continue to be carried out in stages. The Council welcomed the Commission's plan to examine how Frontex's mandate can be extended to enable increased cooperation with third countries. An evaluation of the Frontex Regulation is currently being carried out and the Commission will present a proposal for possible amendments at the beginning of 2010. The Council is looking forward to adopting a position on the Commission's proposed amendments together with the European Parliament.
It was also emphasised in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which was adopted by the European Council in October 2008, that the Agency's role and resources for cooperation need to be strengthened. The Pact also referred to the possibility of establishing separate divisions within Frontex, as conditions differ so markedly, for example, at the land border in the east compared with the maritime border in the south. In the light of the events in the Mediterranean, the European Council, in its conclusions from June 2009, also emphasised the need to increase efforts to prevent and combat illegal immigration and to prevent any future human tragedies at the EU's southern maritime border. The need to tighten up border controls and the need for clear rules for joint patrols and the landing of those that are rescued, as well as the increased use of joint repatriation flights, were given particular emphasis.
In conclusion, I would like to clarify the fact that the situation in the Mediterranean does not only involve taking action in the area of border control. This situation requires a broad spectrum of both short-term and long-term measures. The starting point in this regard should be the EU's global approach to migration, which includes cooperation and measures within the entire migration policy area. Enhanced cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is fundamental and the dialogue with third countries should be intensified in areas such as legal immigration, migration and development, capacity building and the repatriation of people who have no need of protection. This dialogue must be based on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility.
The challenge of illegal migration does, of course, require an effective prevention strategy, implemented in partnership with all of the countries located along the migratory routes. The European Union is doing all it can to develop these dialogues and this cooperation. The aim of this global approach is to deal with all of the main dimensions of immigration together and in a balanced way. As Mr Billström just said, this approach guides our work in the Mediterranean, which is the meeting point of the migratory flows coming from the different regions and passing through various countries in Asia and Africa.
The work subsequently carried out formed the basis of a series of decisions taken by the June European Council. Since then, the Commission has been working on three major themes. Firstly, asylum: the European Council called for the coordination of voluntary measures concerning the internal distribution of recipients of international protection who reside in the Member States most exposed to these pressures. The Commission responded to this appeal by launching, in July, a pilot project to help Malta. It has made provision for Community funding opportunities for Member States that will be willing to show solidarity with Malta. To date, France has agreed to resettle almost 100 refugees on its territory. I should like this gesture, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, to be repeated by other Member States.
It should be pointed out that the border control operations are conducted in accordance with Community law, in particular with the Schengen Borders Code. Fundamental rights and the prohibition of return must be respected. In maritime areas, these operations must also be conducted in accordance with international maritime law. However, these rules are not interpreted or applied uniformly by the Member States. That is why we are going to try to see how these rules can be developed and clarified so that Community law and international law can be applied better within the context of these operations.
With regard to Libya, Mr Billström and I sent a letter in July proposing to our Libyan partners that we cooperate in a number of areas to ensure the joint and balanced management of migratory flows from Libya. We explained to the Libyan authorities that we were willing to help them not only to strengthen their capacities to prevent migrants from illegally entering and leaving their territory, but also to improve the treatment of migrants in accordance with human rights and with international rules and to identify and assist migrants who need international protection.
With regard to Turkey, the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, Jonathan Faull, is today on an assignment in Ankara to investigate the extent to which, and the means by which, an increase in cooperation could encourage the Turkish authorities to become more involved in a more responsible form of migration management, with the aim both of re-admitting illegal immigrants and, above all, of providing international protection for refugees. If Turkey and Libya are willing to take up our offers, we and Mr Billström will be able to visit these two countries before the end of the year.
I shall not repeat what I said just now, that is, the three major themes of this policy, a common asylum system in line with our humanitarian traditions, more effective control of illegal immigration through more integrated management of our internal borders and our visa policy, and then, of course, the increased effectiveness of our fight against human trafficking and the implementation of a specific return policy aimed at the long-term reintegration of migrants into their community of origin, as well as the opening up to legal migration within a framework that guarantees that the needs of host countries are accommodated, without forgetting the needs of countries of origin or respect for the rights of migrants.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (MT) Thank you, Mr President, I would also like to welcome Minister Billström and, in particular, the Vice-President of the European Commission, Jacques Barrot. Allow me Mr President, to congratulate and thank the Vice-President of the European Commission for the considerable and genuine efforts that he has undertaken in the field of immigration and asylum. I would like to extend my appreciation and gratitude to Mr Barrot for the passion with which he has chosen to carry out this work, and for the concrete initiatives which he has launched in this difficult, controversial and sensitive area. This brings me on to the first point I would like to raise, Mr President, regarding the complexity of this subject.
It is easy to point fingers at one country or other: however, we have to analyse the situation seriously and thoroughly. Otherwise we run the risk of falling prey to the absurd. Allow me to give an example. Lately, there has been criticism levelled at the Italian Government because they promptly sent arriving immigrants back to Libya. However, we have to understand that as a result of Italy's actions, the number of immigrants that have chosen to brave the hazardous journey and risk their lives have decreased considerably this year.
Therefore, we must keep the complexity of the subject in mind at all times. I would like to mention some other points. We must improve upon Frontex, especially with regard to the potential cooperation that could take place between countries, and which include concrete issues such as those tied to return policies involving more than one country. Unfortunately, in this field, Frontex has not yet made enough effort. The initiatives cited by Vice-President Barrot also merit attention, such as the general resettlement programme, the pilot project for countries like Malta and the establishment of an asylum office. These are initiatives that need to be put into place instantly. To conclude, another equally important factor that requires attention is cooperation with Libya and other third countries which are the departure points for immigrants. Without the cooperation of these countries we will get nowhere.
This phenomenon cannot be tackled by any of the Member States on their own, based on their individual capacities. As a result, we need a common policy, which has still not been developed. Everything that has been done to develop this common policy, which must be developed, should have occurred under the European Constitution and under the Treaty of Lisbon. However, this policy has still not been developed. Everything that has been done is in anticipation of what must be done and is still in the very early stages.
However, in the meantime, we must reinforce the European external border, in terms of both its control and our joint responsibility for it. The impact of illegal immigration in Italy, Spain or Greece - as evident in Spain in relation to the southern Mediterranean border, and also in the Canary Islands, with the canoes that arrive full of desperate people - is not purely a Spanish or an Italian matter. It is a European matter, which does not simply require solidarity with Spain or Italy, or even less a hope that Spain and Italy will comply with the European model in their bilateral relations with African countries. No, it is a joint responsibility, which requires a joint response.
I demand that the Commission does not - if this is its intention - conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one, as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement. I repeat, alas this agreement forces these people to undergo torture, because this is what we are dealing with: the detention centres to which they are taken in Libya are torture, according to press reports and also photographs, for example, photographs which show many of these immigrants in Ganfuda prison, 10 kilometres from Benghazi. This is torture, which I do not believe is accounted for in any friendship or institutional agreements.
As highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the non-refoulement principle prevents people being returned to territories where their lives could be considered to be in danger or their freedom could be threatened. Sending these people back to Libya which, I would again remind you, has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Convention, seems truly unbelievable. Moreover, to add insult to injury, illegal immigration is a criminal offence in Italy so, for example, after the dramatic landing at the end of August in which many Somalis lost their lives, those few, I think four or five Somalis who managed to reach their destination have, among other things, been accused of immigration and are therefore now being prosecuted under Italian law.
Confronted with this situation, Mr Barrot, you refer to some key issues. You refer to the right of asylum, to the right to international protection. You should also refer to the right of any person to leave any country, and to the obligation placed on everyone to help others, whoever they may be. This is international maritime law. These situations are on the increase, and they are also occurring more and more at the border between Turkey and Greece. This is why I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that strengthening Frontex's resources will be the answer to this situation.
Meanwhile, though, I think a major priority should be securing the southern borders. Frontex must play a more prominent part in this regard in order to act as a strong deterrent to economic migrants wishing to make the hazardous trip across the Mediterranean. We must act more strongly against the various third countries that irresponsibly encourage those activities. The Commission says it will be national governments that ultimately decide the number of people they accept, and that Britain and other countries will not be forced to accept large numbers of economic migrants that it cannot cope with or cannot support in these economically challenging times. That is necessary and right. Countries like Britain need guarantees that our asylum and immigration policy remains for us to decide and guarantees also that the EU's approach will remain one of open cooperation and not one of compulsion.
This policy of trying to make Europe into a fortress at this time of crisis, which is a triple crisis in terms of food, finance and energy, is not understood by everyone, because our work is poor and heading in the wrong direction. If Europe is needed and, in particular, if Europe is needed thanks to migrant workers, then we must respect all their rights and not make them into criminals, as the European Union is doing. This is simply bringing more pain to families that are just trying to escape war or hunger.
But a 'one-size-fits-all' immigration policy will not work for Britain. Britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, more densely populated, surprisingly, than India, China or Japan. Net immigration to Britain is now running at about 230 000 people per annum, adding over a million new people to the population every five years. The population will rise from its current 61.4 million, an all-time high, to about 70 million plus in 2031, and then spiral ever upwards. All this growth is due to immigration and births to immigrants.
The UK Independence Party is not opposed to some immigration, but this should be strictly controlled and for the benefit of Britain and not the European Union or anybody else. Britain does not need a common European immigration policy. What we need to do is end mass immigration now and introduce a strictly limited and controlled immigration policy. We should apply the terms of the 1951 Convention on Refugees, which requires them to seek sanctuary in the first designated safe country they come to - which is not a little island off the coast of Europe called Britain.
(NL) Mr President, Frontex is not working. The budget for Poseidon, the operation currently under way, is EUR 11 million. This is pointless. It is money down the drain. Direct returns and a crackdown on the countries that make this immigration possible is the only solution. The common asylum and immigration policy is not in the interests of the Dutch people. The Dutch Party for Freedom, on whose behalf I am speaking, is vehemently opposed to this policy. It will result in even more people with no prospects entering Europe. The Dutch people do not need solidarity, what they need is for us to stand up here for Dutch interests. Let there be an end to it then.
I should like to give a further reaction to the Swedish Presidency. This Presidency takes the view that Europe should further open its borders to mass immigration for the sake of its labour market. The Party for Freedom rejects this out of hand. It is a smoke screen to enable mass immigration. Look at what is happening in the big cities - look at the enormous problems they face. Think about your own people, think about your own country, think about your own culture. We shall be doing so, in any case. I should like to add that enough is enough. Let there be an end to mass immigration; it has gone far enough.
Frontex undoubtedly plays a key role in Europe's approach to migration. As we build a more coordinated EU system for managing our external borders, the importance of Frontex increases. Therefore, my group believes that it is crucial to get the balance right: the balance between, on the one hand, resourcing Frontex - as many colleagues have mentioned - and, on the other hand, ensuring that Frontex has a stronger appreciation of the humanitarian aspects of its work. For example, how can Frontex help bring down the tragic number of deaths at sea, over 12 000 in the last 10 years? Sea rescue operations have therefore to be included in its remit. The devil is in the detail. Many of these policies need to work on the ground, and I know that Parliament, Commission and Council are trying to do this.
Minister Billström, you have said that we need some checks and balances on our external borders but, I ask you, why cannot we have some checks and balances on those people who are working and defending our external borders? Why cannot we have some transparency and clarity about Frontex and what they are doing? We need clarity and transparency in this House, in the European Parliament, about Frontex's deeds. We need clarity about what is the stage of the procedure of the new rules of Frontex that you mentioned, Commissioner, and we need some clarification about how refugees can obtain international protection when they are intercepted at sea.
We also need transparency about the deals that are being made with third countries and what happens exactly to the EU money that is being put into Libya, for example. I doubt whether what you called Libya's assistance to refugees is actually helpful to refugees but here again, we are just lacking transparency and if, as you said, not even Member States interpret the rights of migrants the same way as you do, then how are you going to make sure that third countries such as Libya are going to follow your sort of interpretation?
Migration is, of course, one of the greatest problems facing Europe today. What is more, it is a problem not just for us politicians, but it is also a problem for the people of the European Union's Member States. It is, perhaps, one of the main challenges currently facing the political class in Europe, and one of the main problems of our electors. Immigration has more than one name, because my esteemed fellow Members have spoken today about immigration from Africa, which mainly affects the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, and what they said is, in a certain sense, justified. I represent a country - Poland - where this illegal immigration is, of course, smaller, but people come to us from the countries of the former Soviet Union, and some from Asia.
We are faced with a question about the philosophy of the EU's fight against illegal immigration, and - let us put it simply - also against restrictions on legal immigration. Does Frontex have to bear the brunt of this fight? Is this really advisable? Would it not be more effective for the extra money which we want to give Frontex to be allocated to the countries which have the greatest problem with illegal immigration, and also to EU Member States whose borders are part of the EU's external borders? Mr President, it seems to me, as I finish, that this would be more advisable.
It is not by throwing money at Frontex now, at the beginning of its mandate - money that Frontex cannot spend and that the Commission says it is inadvisable to give to Frontex at this time - it is not by doing this that we will solve the problem. The way in which we can solve the problem is by re-examining Frontex's mandate, and then Frontex might need more money. For that to happen, Frontex would have to cooperate and provide the UNHCR with full information; for that to happen, Frontex would have to include humanitarian concerns in its policies, which it does not do at the moment. Just as serious, ladies and gentlemen, is the proposal regarding refugee funds: while we are investing more in Frontex, these funds are being cut back.
This is the key point, in my view, because otherwise we end up in the paradoxical situation whereby some Member States, including Italy, Malta, Greece and Spain, are obliged to receive illegal immigrants, whereas others hide behind the discretional concept of solidarity on a voluntary basis. They cannot hide from this any longer. I would like to thank France which has offered to accept 100 people, 100 asylum seekers: 100 people, but that is out of the thousands, tens of thousands of asylum seekers. I therefore thank France, but it is a drop in the ocean.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will immediately start by saying, without exaggeration, that for me, hospitality is a sacred value. Ultimately, it is solidarity between people which gives rise to the communities of a state, which are regulated by means of certain special obligations: rights and duties. Therefore as far as I am concerned, I am firmly opposed to anything that runs counter to this basic biblical principle. Clearly, it is the action of taking people in and also the ways in which we need to do this which combine to give rise to integration and all it entails.
Do we really think, Mr Billström, that all this responsibility can be shouldered by individual states? Until now, Europe has very probably acted with some uncertainty, but it seems to me that it can no longer put off establishing a united, serious approach to immigration. It cannot speak as it has been doing, with many discordant voices, and cannot force the most exposed and vulnerable individual frontline states into isolation. It cannot do so without a common position reached collectively, one which so far, we have not had, but whose essential principles are continually defended.
Tension between the individual states and Europe stems from this and is causing problems, and this is also increasing Europe's democratic deficit, which is only set to get worse in the absence of a coordinated policy on immigration; it is heightening the impression that the self-interests of states prevail over the greater good. It is intensifying, Mr President, the frustrating perception that Brussels and Strasbourg all too often deal with obscure issues and not those which concern the public. Ultimately, it is undermining Europe's political identity.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this debate to draw the EU's attention to the grave violations of fundamental human rights taking place in Italy. Since May, over 1 000 migrants have been picked up at sea by the Italian authorities and handed over to Libya in the course of informal and indiscriminate refoulements without identifying the people, giving them the right to appeal or access to asylum procedures, with the danger that they will be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in Libya. As Commissioner Barrot confirmed when he asked Italy for details, we believe that these practices violate the fundamental principles which underpin Europe.
Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, illegal immigration in Italy has become a criminal offence, an aggravating circumstance. The mere fact of being a migrant entails discrimination and inequality, and gives rise to harsher punishments for the same crime. The fact of being an illegal migrant, as were the families of our Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Greek and Italian communities, blocks access to fundamental rights and to the most basic care, including health services, for fear of being reported. This is happening in Italy, Mr President, and has also been denounced by legal and constitutional experts and secular and Catholic associations.
We see traffickers who move illegal immigrants giving them instructions on how to shoot themselves in the arm or leg in the event of arrest, so that the Member States are obliged to adopt and apply a different type of legislation to that which governs illegal immigration, because they are now injured persons. We see traffickers giving illegal immigrants instructions to destroy their papers before they enter a country, so that host countries such as Greece have no idea where to send them; we see immigrants claiming that they are seeking asylum, but have no papers so that we can establish the facts.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, when setting out the European asylum plan, you yourself, Mr Barrot, talked of steadfastness in the fight against illegal immigration and of humanity when receiving the victims of persecution. Translated into legal terms, this means ensuring protection and the right to asylum for those fleeing starvation, war and persecution, and preventing their expulsion to countries where their lives are in danger or they risk inhumane treatment.
I therefore call on the Commission to take action as soon as possible to ensure that the rules of international law are restored and complied with. Furthermore, I would like to know what progress has been made in the negotiations on the bilateral agreement between the EU and Libya, already underway for a number of years. When do you expect to conclude it? Can the Council and the Commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the Italy-Libya one? Can you explain to Parliament the key points relating to tackling illegal immigration and guaranteeing the right to asylum and the principle of non-refoulement?
(DE) Mr President, border officials of European states are forbidden to turn away potential asylum seekers who arrive by sea or to escort them away, prevent them from travelling further or return them to countries which do not form part of the EU. This is laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights. Today, we have once again heard numerous examples of how Frontex does not comply with these rules in practice. For this reason, we need controls in this area. We need these controls as Members of the European Parliament, because it is our responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights are observed.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you all for a very interesting debate. A lot of valuable opinions have been expressed here today. I would like to mention Mr Busuttil's views on greater cooperation with Libya. I hope to be able to visit Libya along with Commissioner Barrot in order to build relations with this country, and the work with Turkey will also continue. I also agree with Mr Aguilar, Chairman of the Committee on Civil liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, that one way to tackle illegal immigration is to open the way for legal immigration. That would relieve the pressure on the asylum system, for example.
I would like to say to Mrs Alfano that it is important that the legal acts adopted by the European Council are complied with and that all Member States implement them as decided. It is also important to involve the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in our work in order to achieve the high quality that we are aiming for. I must also say that I agree with Mr Kirkhope's assessment of the importance of distinguishing between asylum and the immigration of workers. This reasoning leads us, naturally, to the conclusion that the EU needs a common European asylum system and also better opportunities for the legal immigration of workers based on national needs, legal certainty and protection against wage dumping and social exploitation.
I would add that Community legislation demands that the Member States conduct border control operations in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement. This principle means that a State must refrain from returning people to a territory in which they could run the risk of being subjected to torture, punishments, or inhumane or degrading treatment. In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, return cannot take place where their lives and freedom may be threatened on the grounds of their race, religion or nationality. In short, we are ensuring that this duty of protection is upheld.
Finally, I should like to reiterate our desire, with Mr Billström, to engage with Libya, on the one hand, and with Turkey, on the other, in a real dialogue that will allow us to get to the bottom of matters, to be able to cooperate on border control in order to prevent illegal migration, but also to see how, with the support of the High Commissioner for Refugees, we can try to initiate procedures in these Mediterranean countries that will mean that genuine asylum seekers do not have to resort to smugglers or traffickers in order to reach European shores and will see their asylum applications processed in those countries.
I should like to finish with a somewhat urgent appeal to the European Parliament to help us, in particular, regarding this strategy, this European asylum policy. I would point out - since the matter has been raised - that we wished to improve the application of the Dublin agreement by allowing some flexibility. We have sought permission from the Council and Parliament to set up this support office by the end of the year, and we are also going to prepare for the harmonisation of the instruction procedures. All of this makes for a real European asylum policy that I feel is entirely consistent with the values on which, in my view, there is consensus in Europe. We believe in these values. They must be translated into action.
in writing. - I welcome this debate, which brings attention to the fragmented and inconsistent EU policies on border control, immigration and asylum seekers. I am glad to hear that the Council and Commission recognise these as priority issues, but so far we have seen only half-measures to address them and no meaningful results. It seems that there is a lack of political will on an EU level to provide adequate resources to tackle these issues in a fair manner. For the moment, Member States with external borders are carrying most of the burden and their situation is worsening by the day due to a lack of resources and capacity. Some good proposals have been discussed lately, such as the revision of the FRONTEX mandate, an EU-wide refugee resettlement scheme and the creation of a European asylum support office. I urge the Commission to act quickly on their implementation. We need more solutions based on a burden-sharing approach as it is the only adequate response. The Commission and Council must show more resolve in providing the necessary funding for FRONTEX. To protect our borders effectively, it should have its own equipment and assets, and operate on a year round basis.
The future extension of the Schengen area to include Romania will increase the importance of ensuring the security of Romania's external borders and, therefore, the role of the FRONTEX agency in Romania. The FRONTEX agency must play an ever-increasing role in the process of improving the monitoring and control of Romania's external borders, representing more than 2 000 km of the EU's external frontier, in other words, the Schengen area's future external border. During the last year, FRONTEX has signed cooperation agreements with Russia and the countries in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as with Ukraine and Moldova. This is a step forward towards managing all borders. One welcome measure, at this point, would be for the European Commission to examine the ways in which FRONTEX could utilise this legal basis. The possibility of signing cooperation agreements with other third countries is another matter which the Commission must explore. Obtaining as many agreements of this kind as possible will facilitate the effective coordination of joint operations and, consequently, contribute to the respect for human rights and civil liberties and to the fight against cross-border crime.
However, when illegal immigration results in emergency situations, hardship, crime and insecurity, a tangible strategy for integration at levels that countries can sustain in demographic terms becomes necessary. We are fooling ourselves if we believe that the problem is limited to the countries bordering the Mediterranean: the free movement of citizens in the EU can only encourage the free movement of many illegal immigrants who have turned to crime. Every European state has a moral and direct interest since this is related to the issue of crime and the security of the half a billion citizens who have given us a mandate to protect them with urgent, tangible actions, both with regard to existing problems and those which are likely to develop rapidly. The rights of citizens cannot be traded for the general indifference of the Member States or for Solonic warnings by the European Commission.
I voted in favour of the report on mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in favour of France because I believe this fund helps countries to respond effectively and flexibly to situations created by natural disasters, in this case the storm last January which affected south-western France, causing severe damage. This financial instrument of solidarity is mobilised in cases where the damage caused by a disaster is so severe that national resources are insufficient to respond effectively to the crisis, the aim being to stimulate economic recovery and meet the needs of the Member State affected.
I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague and friend, Mr Böge, calling on the European Parliament to approve the proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide approximately EUR 109 million in commitment and payment appropriations in 2009 to help France, the victim of a disaster caused by storm Klaus which, in January 2009, hit 31 departments in the south-west of the country, causing an estimated EUR 4 billion or so of serious damage. I will take advantage of this speech to congratulate Mr Lamassoure, the chairman of our Parliament's Committee on Budgets, on the speed with which he, together with the European Commission's services, has dealt with this matter.
While it is right to welcome this progress, it is worth continuing to call for the fund to be made available more quickly. The current procedure for managing the Solidarity Fund makes this difficult. Nonetheless, a revised proposal for a regulation was tabled by the European Commission and supported by a large majority of Parliament in May 2006. I regret that the Council has still not taken up this matter and I would encourage it now to consider, as soon as possible, the possibility of bringing the European Union Solidarity Fund into operation more quickly.
I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague and friend, Mr Böge, calling on the European Parliament to approve the proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to provide EUR 4.1 million in commitment and payment appropriations to help the Spanish and Portuguese textile sectors (Catalonia and Norte-Centro regions). The aim is to provide aid for the workers affected by the consequences of the significant changes in the structure of international trade and to help them re-enter the labour market. I share my colleagues' view about speeding up mobilisation of this fund and about assessing its complementarity with other existing instruments such as the Social Fund.
European companies, which respect the social rights of employees that have been established and acquired over decades, are left at a disadvantage because of the higher costs that they incur as a result. We must stop this development from going any further immediately. A ban must be imposed as soon as possible on the import of products into the EU which are not produced under specific minimum social standards. Until this has been achieved, we can only work to reduce the damage caused by globalisation in the relevant countries. Therefore, I have voted without reservations in favour of releasing aid from the fund.
In recognising the adverse impact of globalisation, which is all too evident in the industrial regions of Europe, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is grounded in the solidarity of the European project and brings it closer to the people by providing assistance for those workers who are worst affected by these changes. Portugal's Norte and Centro regions, where the economy was based on traditional sectors such as the textile industry, have been modernising since the early 1990s in an attempt to adapt to rapidly increasing competition.
The textile industry employs roughly 15% of the labour force in these areas of the country, and almost 98% of the unemployment in the sector across the country is concentrated in these two regions. The worsening economic climate that has harmed these regions, along with others - particularly the outermost regions such as Madeira, where tourism is very important - has had worrying consequences in terms of social cohesion, above all, because of the rise in unemployment. I therefore support the mobilisation of EUR 832 800 from the EGF in the wake of the 1 588 redundancies in the textile industry in Portugal's Norte and Centro regions. This sum must be used wisely for retraining these workers and reincorporating them quickly and sustainably into the labour market.
In January 2009, France was hit by a severe storm. Storm Klaus caused devastation, in particular to the country's infrastructure. The objective of the Solidarity Fund is to cover part of the cost of damage which has to be paid for out of the public purse. This case meets all the requirements. For this reason, and particularly for reasons of cross-border solidarity with the French citizens who were and, in some cases, still are affected by storm Klaus, I have voted in favour of the Draft amending budget.
I welcome the adoption today of the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Haug, to which I gave my full support. With this vote, we are allowing the European Union Solidarity Fund to be mobilised for the second time this year. Indeed, having come to the aid of Romania, the European Union is now showing its solidarity with the French population which, in January 2009, felt the full force of the devastating and very violent storm Klaus, which was described as a 'major natural disaster' and, as such, was eligible for inclusion in the main scope of this Fund. In total, more than EUR 120 million have been made available in this way.
As you know, this aid is sorely needed for the departments in the south-west of my country, which have suffered considerable damage. I would like to thank my fellow Members for voting in favour of this report. It will, of course, be necessary now to ensure that the French Government involves the local authorities fairly in the process and that these authorities are not cheated as regards the way in which this money is used. Indeed, it would be unacceptable if only the private sector were to benefit from it.
in writing. - We acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, particularly for beef and sheep farmers in the South and East of England who, by wholesale vaccination on their own farms, have created a firewall against bluetongue that their fellow farmers in the North and West have benefited from. In order to vote for EU funding for this vaccine we are obliged (in the same vote) to vote for increased funding for Eurojust and Europol. These are two agencies that operate outside the boundaries acceptable to British law, severely increasing the power of the state at the expense of the liberty of the individual. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, we could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains our voting abstention on the subject.
in writing. - The Fine Gael members of the EPP Group voted in favour of Draft amending budget No 8/2009. We note that this vote includes the creation of a budget item to provide supplementary funding to the High Flux Reactor (HFR) at Petten, Netherlands. Originally, the facility was set up to evaluate materials used in fusion and fission reactors. It has become an indispensable facility for the production of radioisotopes for the medical sectors, covering some 60% of European demand. The report also provides support for, among other things, a strengthened budget to eradicate the bluetongue disease and assistance with European policing and anti-fraud. On balance, given the nature of the HFR and the mix of budget items covered, the Fine Gael delegation voted to support Draft amending budget No 8/2009.
(DE) Mr President, I have no comments on the minutes of yesterday's session, but instead I would like to comment on an incident in this morning's session. My colleague, Kinga Göncz, a Member of Parliament in my group and former Hungarian Foreign Minister, was insulted in the debate this morning by Krisztina Morvai from the fascist Jobbik party in a completely unacceptable way. As Foreign Minister for Hungary, Mrs Göncz has worked harder than almost anyone else in the country to achieve international reconciliation between Hungary and its neighbouring countries. I would like to reject emphatically the outrageous insult made to Mrs Göncz by Mrs Morvai, a member of a neo-fascist party.
This includes, in particular, minorities, gays, Roma and Jews. This paramilitary unit was recently disbanded by the courts, but an MEP from this party wore the uniform of this organisation in this chamber during the July session. In Hungary, this party conducted a campaign full of anti-European, racist, homophobic, anti-Roma and xenophobic diatribes and regularly described Hungary as a colony of the European Union in its utterances. The event which Krisztina Morvai spoke about took place in 2006 when these extreme right-wing protesters set the Hungarian television broadcasting corporation's central building on fire and ran riot for days, resulting in 113 police officers being injured.
They ran riot again on 23 October. They tried, in fact, to disrupt a national ceremony using violence. This was the first time in the country's history, since the change of regime, that the police had had any experience of dealing with extreme right-wing protests. After this, the government set up an independent committee, whose reports are available on a wide range of websites, including in English. This committee made suggestions and numerous court proceedings were also initiated. Hungarian government bodies investigated these abuses.
(HU) Mr President, according to the Rules of Procedure, I have half a minute to ask a question. This question is addressed to Mr Schulz. Based on the slanderous statements made here by his colleague, how can he dare call a party fascist in this Chamber, simply because it does not agree with every aspect of the European Union's main thrust? This party received 430 000 votes in Hungary. You are therefore calling 430 000 voters fascist. From now on, think before you speak!
The Presidency was given a unanimous negotiation mandate by the Council on 27 July 2009 that is based on a proposal from the Commission. It would have been better if the negotiations with the US could have taken place on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Parliament could then have participated fully, but as you are aware, that is not yet possible. Since SWIFT is moving its database from the US to Europe at the end of the year, it is essential that the EU concludes a short-term agreement with the US as soon as possible so that there is no risk of the exchange of information being interrupted. That is in everyone's interest.
I would like to stress that this is an interim agreement for the period until a permanent agreement can be concluded. It must have a term of no more than twelve months and the Commission has advised that it intends to submit a proposal for a permanent agreement as soon as a new Treaty is in place. If the TFTP is to be of use to the EU and the Member States, the US must continue to provide the respective authorised authorities within the EU with information from the TFTP in the same way as previously. This is indeed what will happen.
Moreover, the interim agreement will provide an express opportunity for the EU's crime prevention authorities to request information themselves from TFTP databases in the investigation of terrorist crimes. The Presidency is convinced of the benefit of information from the TFTP. At the same time, we are clear that the interim agreement must contain the necessary mechanisms to guarantee the protection of individuals' privacy, the rule of law and data protection. The draft agreement therefore contains a provision stating that there must be a separate EU authority to receive, process and approve any request from the US to obtain information from SWIFT.
We can clearly state that the TFTP will be permitted to be used only in investigations of terrorist crimes, including the financing of terrorism. Neither the US nor the EU may use the system to investigate other kinds of crime or for other purposes. Naturally, it is also important that the transfer of information from the EU to the US under the TFTP is proportionate. In addition to the rules concerning the European authority that I mentioned previously, the agreement therefore also contains a provision stating that the system must be appraised by an independent appraisal body. Where the EU is concerned, this body will consist of representatives of the Presidency, the Commission, and two people from the Member States' national data protection authorities. The task of the appraisal body will be to check compliance with the agreement, to check the correct application of the provisions on data protection and to check that the transfer of data is proportionate.
I myself had the opportunity, during the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 22 July, to explain the workings of the TFTP and why we need an interim solution to prevent its interruption. The joint meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 3 September took place with the Swedish Presidency, the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, Mr Faull, and Mr Bruguière in attendance. I believe that this meeting allowed a number of still open issues to be clarified.
I would like briefly to underline some aspects. The added value of the evaluation, by the US Treasury, of data within the context of the TFTP has been confirmed by Mr Bruguière's report, which the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs were able to examine at the joint meeting at the beginning of September. As the Presidency has also reminded us, this analysis of the data has enabled the US authorities to prevent attacks and to facilitate investigations concerning terrorist attacks, both in the United States and in Europe.
Moving on, I would like, above all, to say to the House, Mr President, that, as the Minister has just mentioned, we are talking about an interim agreement, the duration of which cannot exceed a maximum of 12 months. This means that it can be renegotiated immediately once the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, with the full involvement of the European Parliament. I can genuinely assure you, here, that the Commission will, of course, continue to keep Parliament constantly informed of the progress of this matter.
When, in our resolutions of 2006 and 2007, Parliament asked for the mirroring site of SWIFT to be moved from US to EU soil, it was obviously because we thought that the protection offered by the US framework to EU citizens was not in line with EU standards and would have to be improved. So it is a positive development, and our group welcomes the fact that SWIFT's two new servers will now be moved to Europe and that a new legal framework will be set up in order for the US TFTP to continue using and processing data in cooperation with our law enforcement authorities.
Of course, one of the most important issues is the timing of the agreement and the interim nature of the agreement, as the Council and Commission have set out. The choice of a third-pillar legal base, coupled with its interim character, leaves Parliament - and, therefore, EU citizens - completely out of the legislative process. The Socialist and Democrat Group is clear that this interim agreement should apply only for 12 months and that a new agreement should be negotiated with Parliament as co-legislator so that we in this House can ensure that delicate balance of protecting the fundamental rights of European citizens in the important and critical fight against terrorism.
Mr President, after all these warm words, I am going to put a cat among the pigeons! I am not going to say anything about the content, as I think it is self-evident that what has been negotiated is in line with European standards of legal protection and the protection of personal data, but I do now want to get a couple of answers about the process, as this is the umpteenth example of the Council taking decisions affecting citizens behind closed doors. The governments of Europe and the United States want to know everything about our private lives, but we, as citizens, do not get to know what the Council does. For me, that is a little bit back-to-front. The fight against terror has practically become a kind of runaway train, with the Council showing utter contempt for European citizens and parliamentary democracy. Every time, whether the current case relates to Swift, PNR, data retention or whatever else, we are told that 'this is indispensable to the fight against terror'. I dare say, Minister, but when will we actually get some facts for once, when will we do some evaluation? There are also a number of questions that I would really like to see answered in relation to Swift, as they were not answered on 3 September. Why not? It was known back in 2007 that the architecture of Swift needed to be reformed. Why did the Council only come up with this plan at the very last minute in the summer, while Parliament was still to get started? Why have you not consulted the national parliaments on the mandate? Why? Is this not a case of policy laundering, Minister, where it is actually the case that European governments are trying to get access to our data via the US government? Just come out and say it!
The SWIFT affair is symptomatic of the security blunders imposed in the name of terrorism, where utter contempt is shown for the most fundamental rights of our fellow citizens. In this affair, the United States plundered bank data, without legal basis and without even the slightest information from the authorities in Europe. The scandal has made the European authorities sit up and take notice. An agreement has been signed with the US Government. An expert has made an assessment of this agreement. Which expert, though? A French anti-terror judge, Judge Bruguière, whose errors in the area of fundamental rights are well known in France. We are therefore sceptical about the quality of his report.
The first question that arises is, of course, how we can guarantee that the US will abide by the agreement. I would like to say that first we have the Bruguière report, which provides a good description of compliance with the terms of what has been agreed to date. Secondly, the draft agreement mentions an appraisal body, which I described to you, and also the Presidency, the Commission and representatives of national data protection authorities, the involvement of which is intended to check that the matter is dealt with correctly. Obviously, it is crucial that the information is reliable. It is also important that everyone realises that when information is transferred in this data programme, it is not the case that people can go in at any time and look at whatever they like. There has to be a suspected terrorist crime or the financing of such in order to gain access to this information. Naturally, this restricts how the information can be used.
As regards the criticism as to why this is being brought up now, during the summer, I would point out that the Presidency has asked more or less the same questions as the Members of the European Parliament are asking. We were tasked with preparing the matter thoroughly and analysing - among other things - this report, which answers some questions, but also with other matters. The reality is that it was not us that decided that SWIFT was to be moved to Europe; this is happening on the basis of other decisions. However, the US is keen to be able to use this tool in its fight against terrorism and we also think the equivalent information would be useful to us. In order for this to happen, we need an agreement. Since the Treaty of Lisbon has not entered into force, we felt it was necessary to provide a temporary solution. That is what we are negotiating and that is what we have been mandated by the Council to do. That is what I have attempted to describe.
Neither is it the case that the Presidency wishes to unnecessarily restrict insight or debate in any respect. Firstly, this is a public debate after all, and secondly, we are, of course, happy to talk about how the discussions are going. However, during negotiations, it is not possible to provide continual access to documents since the very nature of negotiations is that things get changed and then changed again. However, I have tried to describe our starting point and the clear mandate that we have from the Council. In this, we are very determined to combine a high level of effectiveness and practical use with the stringent requirements of legal certainty and respect for civil liberties and human rights. I am entirely convinced that we will achieve this. If - contrary to expectation - we do not, then there will be no agreement.
I would simply say that, as far as I am concerned, since taking up my duties, I have obviously noted the fact that the Council asked Judge Bruguière to go and carry out this fact-finding mission in the United States. The Bruguière Report, which dates from December 2008, was handed to me in January 2009. This report was presented to the European Parliament and the JHA Council in February 2009. It was at that point that the Commission felt that it had in its hands the essential elements to ensure the continuity of the TFTP in anticipation of a time when, with the Treaty of Lisbon signed and the Parliament a co-legislator, we can really negotiate a long-term agreement with all the guarantees that the Minister mentioned and all the demands for reciprocity that Mr Strasser, in particular, touched on as well.
Mr President, I have a small point of order. I note that once again we are not getting replies from the Council to the questions that we put. I asked why the Council waited for two years, until the very last moment, to decide on this deal, and I would also like to know - and we can get the answer in writing - why the national parliaments have been completely excluded from the whole procedure. Finally, I read your answer, which was fairly vague and seemed to be saying that you will not publish the legal opinion of the Legal Service of the Council.
One of the main events is an extensive high-level meeting that will take place in Stockholm tomorrow and the following day. Naturally, Sweden and the other countries neighbouring the Baltic have a great interest in the strategy for the area, but we also believe it could serve as a model for other regions and other regional strategies that would be useful to the entire EU. By working across borders and between different sectors in a particular region, we can deal collectively and more effectively with common challenges such as pollution and environmental destruction. We can create new business opportunities and new jobs, and improve transport links.
The aim of the strategy is to improve the environment in the Baltic Sea area and to increase integration and competitiveness in the area. The strategy addresses four challenges in particular: ensuring a sustainable environment, increasing wealth, improving accessibility and attractiveness, and guaranteeing security and certainty in the area. Getting to grips with the environmental issues is, of course, one of the main priorities. There are very serious threats to the Baltic Sea environment which, in turn, means that there is a risk that its economic development will be affected. This is a very sensitive marine environment that is exposed to various kinds of environmental impact.
Decisive efforts are needed, and quickly. In particular, overfertilisation and algal blooms caused by excess nutrient run-off are threatening the ecological equilibrium of the Baltic Sea. At the same time, the Baltic Sea is also affected by pollution from land-based sources, hazardous substances and the effects of climate change. As a result of these acute and serious environmental threats, the Baltic Sea area is an obvious priority in the area of the environment and we hope that conclusions will be adopted in December.
However, the serious state of health of the Baltic Sea area is not the only challenge faced by the region. The economic crisis has made the matter of jobs and growth highly topical. Most of the countries in the Baltic Sea area are small and are dependent on exports. This means that we must increase integration in order to strengthen competitiveness throughout the entire Baltic Sea region. Our aims and goals in this respect are clear. We want the internal market to function better in our region than anywhere else, and we want the new Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth to be implemented effectively in this part of Europe.
Naturally, our objective cannot be achieved overnight, but our goals are ambitious. We deserve a cleaner Baltic Sea at the centre of an area that offers prospects for sustainable economic development across borders, supported by the entire EU. If we can achieve this, then I am convinced that we will be serving the interests of the Baltic Sea area, and I hope that we will also create a model that can be adapted and applied effectively in other regions. I would like to express my thanks for the positive cooperation of the Commission on this matter, and not least the European Parliament - which is, after all, the institution that originally took the initiative and has been a driving force in connection with cooperation in the Baltic Sea area throughout.
Furthermore, the BSS is an example of excellent cooperation between the main institutions of the EU. As you might know - and as it has been said - the strategy in question was initiated by Parliament three years ago, more precisely by the Baltic Europe Intergroup under the excellent leadership of Christopher Beazley. I would also like to express my special gratitude to Commission President Barroso. His understanding and support since 2007 were crucial in preparing a practical version of the strategy, which resulted in the Commission communication last June.
This is a very important point, because I already know that the towns, local authorities and regions will come and ask me, what should we do in order to become involved in the Baltic Sea Strategy? How do we get the funds to run this sort of project? If we do not give them a good answer and cannot indicate how this cooperation is to be organised, then citizens' enthusiasm for Baltic Sea cooperation will probably quickly turn to frustration. That is not the objective that we are working together to achieve and we therefore need to hold very intensive talks on how to organise this cooperation.
Mr President, my group is very happy that the Commission has drafted the EU's first Baltic Sea Strategy document. This is also the first strategy document of its kind for this region and we hope that it will serve in particular to speed up the process of cleaning the eutrophic Baltic Sea. The region's problems can best be solved through cooperation between its peoples, countries, organisations and businesses. My group is especially pleased that Sweden has highlighted the importance of countering the trade in humans and crime. I wish, in particular, to thank Mrs Malmström for this, because I think that this is also her handiwork. This is an important issue, and it is rather odd that in 2009, we should be having to speak about the existence of a trade in humans in the Baltic Sea region. We now need a Baltic Sea action plan to end this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is excellent that the Commission has drafted a proposal for a Baltic Sea Strategy and that Sweden has added it to its agenda. I hope that Sweden will acquire something more tangible in its efforts to protect its marine environment, mainly in the areas of agriculture and shipping. After all, the Baltic Sea is one of the world's most polluted seas, and its biggest environmental problem is eutrophication. Agriculture is mainly responsible for that: there is nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from EU fields. Nitrogen and phosphorus take oxygen from the seabed and feed poisonous algae at the surface. The question of whether the Baltic Sea is to be cleaned is largely in the hands of the EU. The Commission recognises this in its strategy, but the proposals for measures are vague. Virtually the only precise measure is to prohibit the use of phosphates in detergents. That is a necessary move, but we also badly need new rules for agriculture, so that we can produce food without smothering the Baltic Sea at the same time.
The most economic link between the Adriatic and Baltic Sea is the central European route along the course of the Odra, whose overland route ends at the port of Szczecin-Świnoujście. I propose a clear memorandum to re-activate the strategy in its original form, which mentions a central European route, one which will not erase from Europe's development plans major ports such as Szczecin-Świnoujście, which is already suffering from the European Commission's decision to liquidate its shipbuilding industry.
In exactly 2564 hours, the reactor at Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania - the last remaining independent energy source in Lithuania - will be shut down. Europe has already invested EUR 200 million in the safety of this power plant. To decommission it today, European States will have to contribute another EUR 800 million. From a legal point of view, Europe is probably correct; every country has to observe the commitments it has made, but is it really right? Is it right with respect to the citizens of Lithuania and other states? I do not think so. Money for the decommissioning of the reactor will have to be taken from people hit by the economic crisis. Is it logical or right, when there is a crisis in Europe, when GDP in Lithuania has fallen by 22%, when unemployment has reached 15%, when winter is coming, to close a working nuclear plant which is safe, I repeat safe. No, this is wrong. Having given its word, Lithuania will implement the conditions of the accession treaty, but this will be a huge sacrifice. Following this sacrifice, Lithuania will find it considerably harder to overcome the economic crisis. Unemployment in the country will grow even more and poverty will increase.
Ladies and gentlemen, tell me, does Europe need such a sacrifice today? Do we not have a better way to spend EUR 800 million today? Appealing to the conscience, economic logic and common sense of each one of you, I call on you to add to the strategy we are debating today a provision that Ignalina nuclear power plant will remain open until 2012, i.e. until the end of its safe lifespan. I hope that by approving President J. Buzek's political programme in the area of energy, that is, diversification of energy supply and the development of nuclear power in Member States, the European Parliament will make the concrete steps required. Ladies and gentlemen, there are only 2563 hours and 58 minutes until the reactor is shut down.
It is therefore important when implementing this integrated strategy for the Baltic Sea area - a very important exemplary EU project - for regions and organisations to cooperate as a network, because these organisations know best what is important for them in the various sectors, such as nature, social structure and infrastructure; they know what to do for the best. This is an area with 100 million inhabitants and an investment budget of EUR 50 billion. We need to proceed very carefully here if we are to make a success of this pilot project. This pilot project is, as already mentioned, very important for other projects along the Danube, too, for the states bordering the Danube in central and south-east Europe.
I would like to make four points, Mr Commissioner. First of all, I believe it is key to focus on managing the Baltic Sea Strategy in such a way as to avoid eroding interest both at local, as well as at government and European Union level. We should also concentrate on properly funding the implementation and operation of the strategy itself - on this matter, an amendment to the budget has been agreed. Secondly, there is the need for full implementation of single market principles in the macroregion, taking into account the experience and engagement at local and regional level. The two final matters are: institutional support for funding undertakings within the scope of the strategy, and maintaining good relations with our partners in the region, including Russia, Norway and Belarus.
(SV) Mr President, I am delighted that environmental issues are a main priority in the new strategy for the Baltic Sea area. The Baltic Sea is suffering two major acute environmental problems. The first - overfertilisation - has already been mentioned by Mrs Hassi. The second problem is overfishing. Researchers are entirely unanimous on this. Relatively recent knowledge suggests that the lack of top predators, i.e. cod, has further worsened the algal blooms. The problem is that the Baltic Sea needs a healthy ecosystem. It would therefore be very good if a pilot project - a fast track project - could be established within the new Baltic Sea Strategy involving regional fisheries management in the Baltic Sea area. We would also need to prohibit the dumping of cod and this should take effect immediately. At present large volumes of young cod that have just arrived in the Baltic Sea are being dumped. I call on the Swedish Presidency to take up my challenge and deal with this problem.
I can see savings in linking up local and regional bodies. It is essential in the practical implementation of the Baltic Sea Strategy to rearrange the responsibilities of the various administrative bodies within the system of multi-layered government in order that the activities of the various bodies and organisations do not overlap. In future discussions on the impending cohesion policy, it would be useful, at the same time, to clarify how the various macro-regional strategies and mainstream EU regional policies will co-exist alongside one another. It would also be useful to clarify how the Baltic Sea Strategy will affect the planned application of a territorial cohesion policy.
(DA) Mr President, we are discussing a 1 200 km gas pipeline beneath the Baltic from Vyborg in Russia to Greifswald in Germany through an ecologically sensitive inland sea where there is a large difference in sea bed levels, through an area where undetonated explosives from two world wars, as well as poisonous chemicals from the paper industry, are constantly being found. Around EUR 100 million have been expended on an environmental analysis performed by the company that is to lay the pipeline, namely Nord Stream - a gas supply agreement between Gerhard Schröder and Vladimir Putin. I will not even mention the security issues surrounding the great increase this will bring to Russia's influence in the Baltic, but instead I will stick to the environmental problems this will bring. Unfortunately, Finland has already approved the project, but on behalf of Timo Soini, as well as for myself, I would now like to establish the whereabouts of the information relating to the project which the citizens of all the countries on the Baltic need before building work takes place.
(LV) Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the formulation of a strategy for the Baltic Sea region is a very important achievement for Parliament, in which the members of the Baltic intergroup have played a leading role. This strategy is comparable to the Mediterranean strategy which, in its time, stimulated rapid economic growth in the South. It will serve as a good instrument for the development of the Baltic region and, as a result, for the whole of the European Union. Speaking of priorities, I should first wish to mention the development of a common European Union energy policy, including a competitive Baltic energy market. This involves not only the aspects of security of energy supply and energy efficiency, but also, naturally, the development of renewable energy.
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia must be integrated into the common regional energy network, including NORDEL. Our second priority is further infrastructure development. The roads in some Baltic Sea region countries, given both climatic conditions and also sometimes ineffective policies, are in a quite poor state. The development of transit corridors and communications networks will stimulate business and create new jobs. So that we may speak of effective economic development and protection of the environment, the third priority is an innovative economy, which means growth that is balanced and knowledge-based. In order to carry out the strategy, additional finance is essential, and this must definitely be provided in the next European Union financial framework.
We must now make use both of the EUR 5 billion energy programme and of the globalisation fund and other financial instruments. An effective mechanism for implementing and monitoring the strategy is also important. It has to be simple, transparent and free of superfluous bureaucracy. Regular reviews of the introduction of the strategy and interim reports are essential. The first should already be produced in 2010. I welcome the Swedish Presidency's active role in getting the strategy going. Allow me to express the hope that we shall be effective and flexible in carrying out this specific action plan.
(PL) Mr President, five years ago, the Baltic Sea effectively became an internal sea of the European Union. Today we are debating a draft strategy which will allow us to unleash the huge dormant potential of the region, a project which was the initiative of the European Parliament. However, not all the recommendations of this House have been accepted by the Commission. The most significant was the lack of, and the retreat from, setting up a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea region. The Commission assures us that funding will come from existing instruments, primarily the structural funds. However, I fear that without special funding earmarked specifically for this purpose, we will not be able to achieve all our aims.
Mr President, it is indeed a unique European regional policy initiative and a pioneering project. Innovation-driven prosperity, the environment, accessibility in terms of transport and energy connections, and security and safety are the four major areas for joint work by all partners who are involved in preparation of the strategy: all three European institutions - Parliament, the Commission, the Council - but also national governments, regional and local authorities, business and academic communities and non-governmental organisations. The process of the preparation of the strategy has led to a genuine partnership between all of them.
(FI) Mr President, the European Union became aware of the Baltic Sea issue quite late on. A total of 100 million people live by its shoreline, and then there is Russia, which is important. This strategy will have a strong environmental dimension, and this is only right, because the environmental problems of the Baltic Sea are colossal: eutrophication, fading biodiversity, the waste waters of St Petersburg, the problems of Kaliningrad, and so on. It has been mentioned here that this will also change the European Union Cohesion Policy, and this, I think, is quite important, and I hope that more will be said about it here. Minister Malmström says how it will change because the change to the Cohesion Policy will result, for example, in the danger that, when we speak of the Danube Strategy and the Black Sea Strategy, part of Europe, including northern regions, will be ignored and, in fact, Arctic areas right now are undergoing the world's most rapid changes, and this is important to see.
(FI) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the Baltic Sea as a region is special in many ways, and so I am very pleased that Sweden has made this strategy one of its priorities during its Presidency. It is important that we take the strategy forward and thus also implement it. Not only does the Baltic Sea have a very strong environmental dimension to it; I think it also has a major impact on regional policy. During its presidency, Sweden has also integrated these regional policy matters closely with this Baltic Sea Strategy. The strategy is mainly understood as a document that relates to the countries along its shores and their coastal areas, but it definitely has a robust regional dimension. How we go about integrating with this strategy environmental technological expertise, issues concerning inland waters, and its huge impact on transport policy, will also have major repercussions for inland areas. The Baltic Sea Strategy must therefore be made part of the common European agenda. I hope it gets Parliament's strong support so that the strategy is not just empty words and so that we can achieve something tangible.
Mr President, as an MEP elected in Latvia, I welcome the fact that the first example of a strategy for a macroregion concerns the Baltic Sea area. Nevertheless, in my opinion, a number of Community objectives have been forgotten here - for instance, a high level of social protection. Some of the region's Member States, including Latvia, have been severely hit by the economic crisis. Our financial sector is interconnected with the Scandinavian one. This means that our problems will create problems there, so this is not a national issue.
(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank the Commission and the Swedish Government for the very active role they have played, and I believe that the Baltic Sea Strategy is a good and important one. Without proper financing, however, the project will not succeed. In that case, all this will end after the strategy has been adopted. Parliament has been pondering for many years how financing should be organised, and last year it unanimously agreed on the budget having its own Baltic Sea Strategy heading. That is the means, the instrument, for gathering together all the countless projects that the Baltic Sea Strategy now needs if it is to go ahead. I know that the Committee on Budgets has now made proposals for setting aside a little money under the heading, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will also support this, because otherwise the project will simply not succeed. Something else we need to do if we want to rescue the Baltic Sea environment is to obtain Russia's commitment to this project. I find it incomprehensible how some have been prepared to agree to a gas pipeline running through the Baltic Sea without any obligation on the part of Russia even to commit to the conclusions in the Espoo Convention. That is the least we must do.
Our common objectives are, of course, to improve the competitiveness of our economy in the Baltic Sea area, taking particular account of the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and of a common energy policy which also takes account of renewable energies. That raises the question of how we deal with offshore installations in the Baltic Sea. Maintaining clean water, because that is our foundation and our resource, plays a very, very important role here, when we think of fisheries and when we think of tourism. That is why investments in treatment plants need to be promoted.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for the great level of support that you have given us for our continued work on the Baltic Sea Strategy. It is only natural that we should be supported by the European Parliament, because in fact you were the founding fathers of the whole idea of a strategy for the Baltic Sea area and I am pleased that you are also going to ensure that this strategy becomes a reality. It can only be a success - it can only become real, and not just fine words and rhetoric - if all the Member States genuinely acknowledge ownership and feel a real responsibility for ensuring that the project is realised.
Some Members, Mrs Krehl and Mr Itälä, have raised the matter of resources. It is not intended that any new funds will be earmarked for the strategy. However, there are plenty of resources in the region that we can use. EUR 55 million has been earmarked for the region under the existing budgetary framework. We also know that we can hope for contributions from international institutions such as the EIB, which has shown great interest in the Baltic Sea region. The aim is to keep all administrative costs as low as possible and to work with those who have responsibility locally and nationally for the various flagship projects.
One of these concerns trafficking - an area mentioned by Mrs Jäätteenmäki. There is a project that involves strengthening the training of customs and police officers in the region in order to be better able to identify and work on the issue of trafficking. Mrs Hassi and Mrs Lövin mentioned the matter of the marine environment, agriculture and fisheries. There are a number of such projects here and I would very much like to see more of them. I also believe that the strategy could provide the opportunity to gain a better overview of our environmental efforts and our fisheries and agriculture policy and to ensure that they work towards the same ends.
There are also other partnerships in the Baltic region. We have an extensive and growing energy policy partnership in which we aim to link up the energy infrastructure in the region, to reduce dependence and improve efficiency. Naturally, this is something that the Union will continue to work on. The Ignalina plant has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea Strategy. That was an old decision that already existed from the time of Lithuania's accession negotiations. Neither does Nord Stream have anything to do with this. Naturally it is related to the Baltic Sea, but it is not part of the strategy. It is a commercial project that has been examined in accordance with current international environmental conventions and relevant national legislation.
We are looking forward to the conference tomorrow and on Friday and are pleased that Vice-President Wallis is coming to Stockholm. At the conference, we will discuss the strategy for the Baltic Sea area and we hope to gain a strong commitment from the countries concerned to work towards this becoming a reality, as well as discussing macroregions in general. The Danube region and the Black Sea region have been mentioned in this connection. I believe that there is a great deal to do here and a great deal that can inspire us. We hope to be able to move forward in the discussion, although it is a little too early to set actual timetables at present. Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for its strong support for the Baltic Sea Strategy and I look forward to discussing this with Members on future occasions.
I will be unable to respond to all comments and issues raised in the debate or in your statements. I would like just to refer to three broad groups of issues. First, the shape. I would like to say that the strategy has been designed in line with the objectives and intentions of Member States. The Commission did not interfere in the selection of priorities. The Commission did not shape the priorities, so the ideas of including certain projects or modifying certain priorities is, of course, possible. However, it is to be agreed in the future work related to the implementation of the strategy.
At present, we have more or less three options. We can regulate the use of existing EU funds, for example, by changing criteria for selecting new projects. The second possibility is having recourse to other sources like international financial institutions and finally, although it is difficult at a time of economic recession, we can still try to use national resources. In this respect, I look forward to the work of the conference to be held in Stockholm because this is the conference which may shape the future approach of Member States and the Commission to the macro-regional approach in the future and it should also embrace the financing of potential future strategies. That is why I feel that it will be a good moment to look at the overall macro-regional approach in Stockholm in the forthcoming days.
Mr President, I would like to thank Sweden, the country to hold the presidency, for having had the courage to make its own region, the Baltic Sea, and matters relating to it, such a major topic in its programme during its EU presidential term. It is fitting that the Baltic Sea Strategy that we have been preparing for so long is being dealt with now: there is no time to lose. The central aim of the Baltic Sea Strategy and the Action Programme to improve the region's environment and competitiveness must be taken seriously in terms of the funding allocated to it and the measures implemented. The objectives must be realised in practice: the strategy must not just remain a fancy declaration. We hope in particular that the strategy will expedite the clean up of the Baltic Sea, which is suffering from eutrophication, and help find common solutions to cross border challenges. It is on account of these very objectives that all eyes are now turned to Finland, where soon it will be decided whether or not to allow the construction of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in its territorial waters. Under the Baltic Sea Strategy, the environmental impact of projects such as these must be investigated using a procedure that is legally binding internationally so that the matter cannot just be shrugged off. We must therefore insist that Russia ratifies the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context that it signed in 1991, and the Finnish Government should make this a condition of processing the gas pipeline's construction permit. Russia, which also benefits from the Baltic Sea Strategy, only acts according to the agreement when it suits it. This cannot go on any longer: the stakes are too high, and we have to know about projects that are harmful to the Baltic Sea before it is too late.
in writing. - The Baltic Sea Strategy promoted by the Swedish Presidency is very welcome. It could readily assume a model function for other European macroregions, like the Danube basin. There is, however, one aspect of the development of the Baltic Sea region that demands urgent reconsideration. This is the Nord Stream sea-bed pipeline between Russia and Germany. Not only is the pipeline the source of serious environmental concern, but - even more urgently - it is a project that has been overtaken by time. The future is not in fixed means of delivering natural gas - via pipelines - but through liquefied natural gas. Nord Stream has every likelihood of being a wholly unnecessary white elephant, and its protagonists should reconsider the project before more money and more resources, effort and energy are tied up in it.
It is important to take action aimed at improving the region's environmental situation, as it is one of the most polluted marine areas in the world at the moment. Thousands of tonnes of toxic warfare agents lie on the sea bed encased in mines, bullets, bombs, containers and barrels. Estimates as to the quantities of these chemicals range from 30 000 to 60 000 tonnes, of which Yprite alone is estimated to make up 13 000 tonnes. Chemical weapons were sunk here after World War II in the late 1940s. They had been captured in the German occupation zones, and as burying them underground was difficult, the decision was made simply to sink them into the sea.
Mr President, we are now going to sign a number of legal acts that are absolutely central to the EU's response to the financial and economic crisis that has hit Europe so hard and that will continue to have an impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Czech Presidency, which worked very hard to get these acts in place within a short time. It was thanks to the Czech Presidency that we managed to bring about quickly such successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament, as well as quick, effective agreements.
I would like to now ask Minister Malmström to proceed with the joint signing, which will be done at this table. I also invite Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, Mrs Berès and Mrs Bowles - the previous and current Commissioners on Economic and Monetary Affairs - I would ask both of you to come here to the middle, and the rapporteurs, who include Mr Karas and Mr Gauzès. You will all be present at the signing, and the Minister and I will sign.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Taiwan was shaken to its foundations on 8 August. Typhoon Morakot swept across the island with unbridled force, leaving more than 750 people dead. Thousands lost their belongings and large areas of land were laid waste. The damage amounts to more than EUR 2.5 billion. The reconstruction of an infrastructure that has been widely damaged will take months. As a token of our solidarity, we Europeans wished to support the Taiwanese people by providing disaster relief.
Another cause of irritation was the visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama over several days in September. He merely wanted to pray for the victims with the survivors. Sympathy has long been the message of the much-acclaimed speeches and books of the Dalai Lama. Once again the Chinese government made loud protests and brought a huge amount of pressure to bear. It is outrageous that Peking has once again made a political issue out of a purely humanitarian act by the Dalai Lama. Taiwan must ask itself whose side it is actually on. President Ma Ying-jeou only allowed the Nobel Peace Prize winner to enter the country after strong protests from his own people.
The calamity that has affected Taiwan may well become more commonplace, both in Taiwan and around the world, as a result of climate change. It is therefore essential that Taiwan, as an island vulnerable to such meteorological phenomena and as a major global industrial power, is enabled to participate meaningfully and with dignity in appropriate international organisations, not least those related to weather and climate change. In particular, Taiwan should be allowed to participate in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organisation.
The Commission has played its part, and many Member States have sent aid or teams of experts. The People's Republic of China itself has helped the Taiwanese authorities, and this is a gesture that I consider to be very significant. However, if we want to provide the Taiwanese authorities and the countries of the region with structural help to cope with threats of this kind in the future, the European Union should support Taiwan's admission as an observer to the World Meteorological Organisation and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
This disaster once again poses the issue, as already mentioned by some of my fellow Members, of Taiwan's participation in the various agencies of the United Nations. In principle, the EU institutions encourage this, but it is high time for action to be taken to change things. The Taiwanese authorities did not have access to meteorological information indicating how serious the typhoon was. This is unacceptable. It is absolutely vital that Taiwan accedes to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and is thus in a position to avoid the worst, since there is no doubt at all that there will be further climatic depressions in the future.
(NL) Mr President, this was a disaster on an unprecedented scale for Taiwan. There is great tragedy in the mountains. Whole villages have disappeared and there are a thousand people thought dead or missing. Thousands of survivors, if not more, are being put up in military camps for the time being. This is how Menno Goedhart, the highest representative in Taiwan from my home country, the Netherlands, depicts the devastating effects of typhoon Morakot. First and foremost, I would like to express my sympathies, from this Parliament, to the government and citizens of Taiwan.
In addition to the practical assistance that Menno Goedhart is currently offering his Taiwanese friends, and also whilst appreciating what has already been done from the European side, I would nonetheless like to ask a couple of questions of the Commission in relation to the strengthening of European-Taiwanese relations. First of all, the Commission will be putting forward a proposal next month to relax the visa regime for Taiwanese citizens. The United Kingdom and Ireland have already set a good example in this regard. Secondly, a recent European report demonstrated very clearly that there would be enormous benefits for both Taiwan and the European Union in agreeing trade enhancing measures (TEM). Does the Commission agree with this urgent conclusion?
(FI) Mr President, Taiwan met with human disaster on a huge scale on 8 August. The incident took a heavy toll and the economic damage was immense. Now it is time for us to help. It is time for us to show solidarity with the citizens of Taiwan. We have to show compassion, but, in addition, we have to give financial support, and, as the Commissioner said here, we have to adopt crisis management tools now. We now have to provide the Taiwanese with all the help that is humanly possible. I also wish to express my support for the idea of longer-term assistance to Taiwan as proposed by Mr Tannock, for the best possible results, and so that we can show that they too are human beings and, above all, they are our friends.
(PL) I would like to thank the Commissioner for this information. However, my question is of a slightly different nature. Taiwan has most recently been struck by tragedy. However, we are fully aware of the fact that many disasters of this kind have occurred in the past, and that many more will occur in the future. Therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner the following question. Does the European Union, and the Commission in particular, have any standard procedures in place for dealing with this kind of situation? Is there an emergency action package or provisions for specific countries? Is there also a long-term plan of action?
(NL) Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, like many groups in this House, sympathises with the population of Taiwan and we are pleased that the Commission reacted as it did. The Commission must continue in this vein. The big problem, however, alongside this human catastrophe, is, of course, Taiwan's isolation. It is quite possible to maintain a one-China policy whilst at the same time establishing good working relations with Taiwan. Taiwan could easily play its part in the World Health Organization as an observer. The same applies to the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. All of this is possible and is no obstacle to the one-China policy. I agree with Mr Belder when it comes to relaxing the visa regime and I also concur with the good things he had to say about Mr Goedhart, the Dutch representative in Taipei. I think, therefore, that there is no need for us to continue isolating Taiwan. Working relations, that is what it is about.
author. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to make a final comment on the debate we have just had and say that, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I recently sent a letter to the Conference of Committee Chairs, asking it to consider bringing these discussions forward, so that Parliament may be fully attended and also so that the Council can have a more prominent role here in the discussion. I hope that my fellow Members in the various groups will discuss this matter with their groups' chairmen, as Parliament's authority is continually being gnawed away at because there are so few of us here at any one time.
Now let us turn to the Zhovtis case. Kazakhstan is an important Central Asian country, and it will assume the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe next year. It is therefore not a matter of indifference how crimes are judged in a country that will be at the head of the democratic aspirations of all countries over a vast area of Europe. Accordingly, we should focus attention on the case of human rights defender Yevgeny Zhovtis. He was found guilty of manslaughter in very suspicious circumstances and sentenced to four years in an open prison for running over a pedestrian in July this year.
author. - (LT) As the time approaches when it will chair the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, sadly Kazakhstan is distancing itself from commitments on alignment with European standards. Unjustifiably underlining its unique and special nature, the country shows no regard for the OSCE's recommendations on electoral laws and freedom of the press. Repeated violations of human rights and the direct persecution of human rights defenders increasingly raise doubts as to whether this state is suitable to head an organisation which fights for the implementation of democratic principles. We urge Astana to make concrete progress in the areas of democratisation, the protection of human rights, the rule of law and freedom of the press. Kazakh laws which are based on international law must be applied appropriately and transparently in legal proceedings against the human rights activists Yevgeny Zhovtis, Yesingepov and Dubanov. We must hope and demand that judgments are impartial and that the prisoners' involvement in the human rights movement does not influence the verdict. We urge the Council to raise the matter of these human rights defenders' cases at the next EU-Kazakhstan Human Rights Dialogue Meeting in October. We call on the European Commission to offer intensive assistance to Kazakhstan as it prepares to chair the OSCE, to ensure that this important international organisation is not compromised.
Indisputably every person who commits a criminal offence must accept that legal sanctions will be applied undiscriminatingly and Mr Zhovtis, as an outstanding human rights lawyer, knows this better than anybody. But at the same time we want to make sure that the Kazakh authorities do not use this unfortunate situation to punish Mr Zhovtis for anything else other than the car accident in which he was involved. Mr Zhovtis must not be punished for his human rights activity and for being a very critical voice of the Kazakh Government.
For the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) it is therefore important to establish that we do not in principle wish to question the judgments made by an independent court, unless we are talking about an obvious show trial that does not comply with any principles of law. We have already seen this in Iran. There must be a clear line drawn here. As far as we are concerned, an independent judicial system is the key element of any democratic order. That being the case, we must first take account of the judgment handed down.
The PPE Group acknowledges Kazakhstan's efforts and progress towards democracy and the rule of law. We would like to assure Kazakhstan of our explicit support and encourage this country to continue resolutely along this path. With regard to this particular case, we urge the Kazakh authorities, in their own interests, to provide the public with as much information as possible and to present their view on these events, and to enable a fair appeal or review procedure to be carried out for Mr Zhovtis under the rule of law.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I have to agree with Mrs Jeggle. I am utterly astonished that, in front of the whole Parliament here in Strasbourg, we are having an urgent debate on a traffic accident in Kazakhstan, albeit an accident where somebody was tragically killed and where the driver of the car happens to a human rights activist who has been duly sentenced in a court of law to four years in prison - but even in a low-security prison, which has suddenly become, in the terms of the resolution, 'a labour camp'. I am afraid that bringing this kind of matter before this House really brings the reputation of this House into disrepute and it means that the good work that we try to do in human rights is devalued, when we start talking about traffic accidents.
Are we seriously suggesting the Kazakh Government threw a civilian under the car wheels of a human rights activist? Are we seriously suggesting that the sentence is too harsh for somebody who was convicted of manslaughter? We cannot go on traducing a country like Kazakhstan, simply because of political motivation, to try and bring down their reputation before they chair the OSCE next year. This is politically motivated, and it is a disgrace that it is on the agenda. I hope the House will throw out these resolutions and support the amendments.
(PL) Mr President, I have similar doubts to the previous speaker, Mr Stevenson. Kazakhstan is an important country. It is making a lot of effort in terms of its progress towards democracy. Of course, at the moment, it is not a model of democratic freedoms, but the civil rights situation in that country - and I know Kazakhstan a little, as I have visited it on a number of occasions - is considerably better than in most of the neighbouring countries in the region, and it fortunately does not have the sort of problems that exist in Russia, for example, and which we have just been discussing.
(FI) Mr President, Kazakhstan has an important role to play in Central Asia both economically and in terms of security policy, and the country's cooperation with the European Union has grown. It was pleasing to hear Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Marat Tashin promise last year in anticipation of the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and again in May this year, improvements to the country's human rights situation. Despite the international attention, however, there has been tighter control of the media and there are poor standards of freedom of religion. In addition, we have heard of several cases of the arbitrary arrest of human rights activists.
(DE) Mr President, first of all I would like to say that I am pleased to see Mrs Hautala back here. However, she has not been here for a few years and during this time we have had the Council on Thursday afternoons. The Czech and the German Presidencies were here on Thursdays. I do not think that we should move the debate, as we cannot get through everything on Wednesday, so we need to be here and we need to force the Council to be here on Thursday afternoons as well. That is the solution, not condensing the whole agenda into Wednesday.
I am confused because, undoubtedly, in terms of international relations, Syria has made great progress over the past two years. It has joined the Union for the Mediterranean. It has, on various occasions, acted as a mediator in difficult international situations, including very recently when a young French woman was arrested in Iran. I would say that the fact that the association agreement - which is not yet signed, Mrs Brantner, but which could be fairly soon - the fact that this association agreement has been relaunched is, at the same time, a very positive sign.
On the domestic front, it is true that there are also some very positive developments in Syria. Syrians have taken in 1.5 million Iraqi refugees, and they are looking after them, they have a high level of education, and they have freedom of religion, which is important. However, in terms of political freedom and political plurality, there has been absolutely no progress. To my enormous regret, we continue to see instances of repression and imprisonment of human rights activists and defenders, and we have intervened on several occasions over the last few years to request the release of political prisoners.
It is not enough just to focus cooperation on improving the economic situation. As we have heard, the leading Syrian human rights lawyer, Muhannad Al Hassani, was imprisoned at the end of July without any proper trial. He was charged with weakening national sentiments and spreading false news. The case is not the first of its kind. We in Parliament last intervened in a similar one in 2007. Kamal Abwani, whose cause we were pleading then, is still in jail, although in March the UN investigation team reached the conclusion that it had been an arbitrary arrest.
Syria has a very long way to go when it comes to freedom of speech and of association. The work of NGOs in the country is problematic and thus virtually nonexistent. It will be highly regrettable if we in the EU do not have the courage to set clear criteria for a basis for cooperation with Syria. In my opinion, the onus is very much on us to demand the release of political prisoners and compliance with international human rights agreements before we can move on with the EU -Syria association agreement.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PL) In July, Mr Muhannad Al Hassani, one of the most prominent Syrian human rights activists, was arrested. During a trial held behind closed doors, to which lawyers were not granted access, he was accused of weakening national sentiments and disseminating false information. He had previously already been interrogated on a number of occasions in connection with his activities in the field of human rights and efforts to defend people arrested for political reasons. He was also denied the right to leave the country. Mr Muhannad Al Hassani took part in monitoring the Supreme Court's proceedings as, in the view of Human Rights Watch, the conditions under which these proceedings take place do not meet international standards.
(DE) Mr President, this motion for a resolution is essentially absolutely right, as it is, of course, our duty, particularly in view of the planned association agreement, to state our views clearly, including with regard to the protection of the family, relatives and fellow fighters of Muhannad Al Hassani and also to insist on the demands of Article 2 of the agreement, not least because we Europeans know from the painful experiences of our past what it means for human rights to be trampled underfoot. It was only two decades ago that a communist terrorist regime collapsed in central and south-eastern Europe.
In this regard, however, I would warn against turning a blind eye if in Turkey, which is in the same area as Syria, human rights are not respected in the way they should be. This is even more important given that Turkey is a candidate for accession to the EU with significant shortcomings in the areas of the administration of justice, the penal system, the protection of minorities and religious freedom, even if a biased report from an allegedly independent Commission or the Ahtisaari report give a different impression.
The EU has already expressed its concerns to the Syrian authorities. Syria must observe its international commitments, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Syria is a state party. The Commission, through its delegation in Damascus, together with Member States' embassies, are discussing how to more effectively and efficiently act in defence of human rights' defenders. Clearly, we have to continue calling for actions to protect human rights defenders and to ensure the observation of trials at the Supreme State Security Court. We must continue to support the civil society through our instruments, such as the non-state actors and the European instrument for democracy and human rights budget lines, and give moral support to the families.
I would like to say that when the result was announced, I was at the other end of Europe, in Sicily, and there the result was received just as you have received it - with applause. In many other places throughout Europe, people were also delighted with the Irish result. The Irish have sent a clear signal that they want to continue to be at the heart of a united continent. Míle buíochas do mhuintir na hÉireann. A thousand thanks, and congratulations on the result of the referendum. I said it in Irish, perhaps not very accurately, but that is more or less how it sounds.
I would like to make one more important comment on the Irish referendum. We cannot forget those who voted 'No'. It has become our tradition to think about all Europeans, respecting their views and their right to a different opinion. Those who voted 'No' also want to tell us something. They want to convince us of something, and, most important of all, they want to warn us about something. We take that warning on board, and we will also take their vote into account, but we are extremely pleased that the decided majority of the Irish people said 'Yes', and that they support a common Europe. I myself am determined to work hard at helping you to feel that our common Europe is also your Europe - and we will write the story of Europe's future together.
Setting up the special committee on the financial and economic crisis may prove to be crucial in preparing for the future of the EU. This future could not be achieved by discussing and proposing measures alone, but also by devising mechanisms that can be implemented to avoid us facing a similar situation in the not too distant future. It is therefore vital to learn the lessons of this crisis by examining its causes and consequences. It is also important to correct the failings of the financial system that led to the current situation by adopting better legislation that is duly justified.
Overcoming the current financial crisis and its impact on EU Member States' economies and, ultimately, social areas, requires intensive joint efforts. The decision of the Conference of Presidents of 17 September 2009 to use a special committee to carry out a structured analysis and to draw up proposals for appropriate measures for the maintenance of sustainable, crisis-resistant financial markets is worthy of support. However, on a critical note, it must be said that more than 12 months have now passed since the appearance of the first symptoms of the crisis last year and the onset of the crisis itself at the start of this year. The measures that have since been introduced must be seen primarily as symptom control and emergency measures for safeguarding jobs. In support of this motion, it has to be said that particular attention has to be paid to coordinated and targeted measures as, with all due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, individual solutions will ultimately lead once again to distortions of competition.
On Monday, 28 September, more than 100 people were killed in Conakry, Guinea, when members of the Guinean security forces shot into crowds of demonstrators. Guinean citizens had gathered in a stadium in the capital to demonstrate against the presumed intention of the Guinean military interim leader, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, to run for President. The final death toll is still unknown, as the soldiers also collected the bodies rather than allow them to be counted at public morgues. At this stage, we do not know the real dimension of these tragic events. The number of injured people is said to be at least 1 200, and eye witnesses have reported that soldiers raped women on the streets of Conakry.
During the violent repression, several opposition leaders were wounded and temporarily arrested. The number of protestors still under detention is also unknown; the houses of opposition leaders were ransacked and shops looted by uniformed men. In a TV statement the following day, Captain Camara expressed his condolences with the families of those killed and visited some of the injured. He proclaimed two days of national mourning and pledged to investigate the violence. He distanced himself from the killings by saying that he was not in control of the elements of the military responsible for the atrocities.
The violence in Guinea received worldwide condemnation. The UN Security Council was briefed last Wednesday on the situation in the country. The African Union condemned the events and decided to prepare a report on possible measures to be taken. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for a full international inquiry into the matter. Parliament, as you know, condemned the unconstitutional change of power, and in its resolution of 15 January 2009, called for respect for human rights and a rapid return to constitutional order. The EU decided to open consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and EU development aid - apart from humanitarian aid and support for democratic transition - was frozen.
We have not been alone. Our international partners have acted in line with us. The African Union and ECOWAS decided to suspend Guinea until it established a democratically elected parliament or government. An international contact group on Guinea co-chaired by the African Union and ECOWAS, and with participation by the European Union, was put into place. In March, the military junta agreed with the opposition to have elections before the end of 2009, which gave reasonable hope for a peaceful and democratic transition. Captain Camara gave his assurances that none of the coup leaders would stand for political office. A national transitional council was to guide the transition process and prepare the necessary modification of the constitution in order to help elections.
What can we do, then, to prevent further violence, and how can we help the people of Guinea in their legitimate desire for democracy, the rule of law, peace and development? Well, there are three main areas of action. First of all, we should maintain and reinforce political pressure on the regime in Conakry, notably in the context of the international group. Captain Camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return. The nomination of the President of Burkina Faso, Mr Blaise Compaoré, as facilitator in the crisis on behalf of ECOWAS and the International Contact Group, is a very positive sign, and the European Union has welcomed this appointment via the Presidency. We hope that his mediation will contribute to a secure, peaceful and lasting solution to the situation in Guinea.
Thirdly, we should continue to provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population and support the democratic transition process. The latter will nevertheless depend on the credible willingness of the transitional authorities of Guinea to re-engage in a peaceful and constructive dialogue with a clear commitment to refraining from further violence and to respecting the human rights and political freedoms of its citizens. We will spare no efforts to help the people of Guinea in this critical moment and we are determined to support a return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections. We encourage all stakeholders in Guinea to refrain from violence and to make a peaceful and democratic transition.
It is a paradox, but the situation is fairly simple. We cannot fail to react to the brutal action which has been seen in Guinea. We must demand a halt to the use of violence. With Mrs Malmström, I think the mission of the President of Burkina Faso is a very good thing, and I wish him success. Let us hope that it will be effective. We should also support the African Union, which has announced the imposition of sanctions if civilian rule is not restored.
Mr President, the worrying developments concerning the political situation and security in Guinea require a firm response by the European Union. Indeed, as you know, on 28 September 2009, troops under the Guinean Government carried out the bloody repression of a peaceful demonstration uniting all of the opposition parties, causing 157 deaths and injuring more than a thousand people, some of whom suffered particularly vile instances of rape and mutilation. The Republic of Guinea is a country that has experienced only two dictatorial regimes since its independence in 1958. It is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end.
The European Union, its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara's coup d'état on 28 December 2008. As is procedure, the Council then applied Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to establish a road map with the Guinean authorities, to be used as a framework for democratic transition. This list of measures included, in particular, the organisation of free and transparent elections within a year and the commitment that members of the CNDD, notably Moussa Dadis Camara, would not stand in these elections.
Captain Camara's decision to postpone the organisation of elections until spring 2010 and his refusal to raise the issue of whether he would stand for the Guinean Presidency were a sign of what was to come, with the current escalation. Thus, the demonstration that was bloodily repressed on 28 September was aimed precisely at calling on the junta to honour its commitments. The reaction of the government in office in Conakry shows its true intentions quite clearly: to eliminate all forms of democratic opposition in order to remain in power.
Today, and in light of the latest events, the European Parliament would like to know the decisions the Council intends to take to address this situation. First of all, does the Council intend to push for the creation of an international commission of inquiry on the events of 28 September? How does the Council intend to act to ensure that the CNDD respects its commitments, namely to organise free and transparent elections as soon as possible, without the participation of Moussa Dadis Camara or another member of the CNDD? With regard to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, what measures does the Council intend to take against the Guinean junta? Finally, what concrete commitments has the Council made to support the different initiatives run by ECOWAS, the African Union and the International Contact Group on Guinea?
As for what needs to be done, with regard to certain areas already mentioned by the Swedish Presidency, our requests are as follows: firstly, that together with our African Union partners, we demand the release of the prisoners and political leaders still being detained. Secondly, we must demand that free and democratic elections are held, without the participation of members of the National Council for Democracy and Development. Thirdly, I call for targeted sanctions to be adopted without too much pussyfooting around, since we must, in any case, send out a very clear message, in view of the atrocities which have been committed. Fourthly, we too wish to raise the issue of the fisheries agreement: we in the ALDE Group voted against it in the Committee on Fisheries, thereby helping secure the majority necessary to block the agreement, as far as possible. We believe that this is another important decision that the Council must take.
The fifth point is that we must establish targeted programmes to assist the victims, especially the women who were raped and who certainly need special dedicated help. Lastly, there is the question of justice. For us, it is vital to have not only an international commission of inquiry, but also the full involvement of the International Criminal Court. We believe that if there is a lesson to be learnt from the Conakry victims, it is to confirm once again that justice must be done and that people who commit crimes of this nature in Africa or anywhere else cannot get off scot-free.
As such, I cannot be indifferent to the events in Guinea, as these were human rights campaigners, and more generally representatives of civil society, who were arrested, raped, in the case of women, and massacred on 28 September: more than 150 people were killed and more than 1 250 people were injured - as you said, Minister - in a single day. The repression continued in the days that followed and is still continuing, despite the fact that these people - as has also been said - came peacefully to remind Mr Camara of his own commitments. There is no doubt, according to the witness statements flooding in, that, contrary to the declarations made by the captain, these violent acts were carried out by forces close to the government.
Mr President, we want a resolution to be voted on in the next Strasbourg part-session so that the European Parliament does not just limit itself to speeches, but acts by taking a decision, as it was able to do last January. I will say it once again: this is a matter of urgency. The organisations on the ground are warning us of the risk of ethnic conflict. We must not wait for a new Rwanda before we react; human rights must be defended in Africa just as they must be defended everywhere else in the world.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Malmström described the situation in Guinea perfectly. For several weeks, Guinea has been the scene of violent clashes during which free citizens demonstrating in the streets in the name of their political beliefs have been subjected to unprecedented violence. The Guinean Government is persecuting and killing anyone whose political beliefs differ from those of their leaders, thereby depriving the people of any kind of freedom which, as we well know, is obviously an inviolable right for every human being.
I therefore feel that in addition to expressing our condemnation, we need to respond by taking immediate, concrete action, as my fellow Member Mr Rinaldi just said. In the face of violations and denials of the right to life - with women and children paying the price once again - we cannot fail to act and demand a return to the rule of law. Therefore, by calling upon you, my fellow Members and representatives of the institutions, I hope that we can reach unanimous agreement - and I stress unanimous - to adopt immediate measures enabling the people of Guinea to re-establish fundamental and inalienable rights, such as democracy and freedom, in their country. Naturally, I also wish to personally express my support for all the families affected by these tragic events.
Yesterday, the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, openly urged Moussa Dadis Camara and his regime to step down. I can only agree with this minimum demand and would also like to point out that it would be a disgrace for the European Parliament if, in two weeks' time, we were to vote in favour of a fisheries agreement with Guinea that would provide this regime with more than EUR 1 million at the end of November. The fisheries agreement relates to tuna fishing for 25 European boats. I believe that these boats will quite clearly have to look for other waters to fish in, because the EU cannot do business with dictatorships that slaughter their own people openly on the streets.
The source of the tensions, quite apart from the acts of violence which are appalling, undoubtedly lies in the fact that Dadis Camara wishes to become Guinea's leader permanently and is reluctant to keep his promise not to have any involvement whatsoever in the country's political life. I believe, too, that the international pressure exerted in connection with this must be very clear. On the other hand, I welcome that the President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaoré, who has a great deal of experience in conducting negotiations and mediation in African conflicts, has been appointed as a mediator in this case. I believe that he must be supported by our diplomatic efforts.
Mr President, I must correct Mrs Joly when she said that the Committee on Fisheries voted unanimously to reject this proposed partnership agreement with Guinea. In fact, it voted by just one vote to do so. Quite astonishingly, the PPE Group voted solidly to retain the agreement. This is an agreement which puts some hundreds of thousands of euros into the hands of this regime in order that we can take tuna from the coast. Like many of these agreements, it is a shabby deal at the best of times and, in the present circumstances, it is utterly unacceptable.
As I have mentioned to you several times during the last three months, Mrs Kinga Göncz, a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in this Parliament, used to be a member of a government which we call in Hungary the 'eye-shooter' government, who were shooting at people on the streets of Budapest on 23 October 2006. Ever since then, there has been a human rights crisis in Hungary, and this European Union does not do anything about it. We have a Vice-Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties who was a member of the government at that time. Until we look seriously into this matter, nobody will think that anything we do in the human rights fields is credible.
I think we can say that the European Union has been extremely clear. The events have been condemned by Mr Solana, Mr De Gucht, the Presidency and now, as I know, also by a declaration of the ACP Group in the European Parliament. It is very good that the European Union is unanimous, concrete and concise in its condemnation of these horrible events. We are also acting in very close cooperation with other actors in this, so that the international community can condemn and act in a very coherent way. That is the only way we can really exercise pressure.
On fisheries - whether that can be part of it or not - I hear very clearly what you say. I can only encourage you to continue the discussions with the Commission. It is the Commission which is responsible for EU fishery policy. We are also discussing this with the Commission, and I am sorry they are not here right now. But you can be assured that we will keep on working with the international community to continue with the pressure and to push for a full investigation and, hopefully, also one day for free and fair elections in Guinea. My thanks to you and to the Members for this debate.
As far as the Weber report is concerned, I speak on behalf of Vice-President Barrot and I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the excellent quality of their work. The Commission welcomes the report and supports some of the proposed amendments. The Commission is, by and large, in favour of the proposal presented by five Member States, although the text is not as ambitious as it would have wished. More specifically, the Commission deplores the fact that the scope of the framework decision has been limited to cases where the same person is subject to parallel criminal proceedings for the same offence. The Commission also regrets the fact that the obligation to refer to Eurojust cases where there is a conflict of jurisdiction has been limited and that the list of criteria which must be taken into account to determine the most appropriate jurisdiction has been removed from the operative part of the text. These amendments have weakened the text of the proposal, taking away most of its added value.
The question then is: why is the Council so keen to adopt legislation a few months before that date when, moreover, that legislation does not represent a step forward in establishing a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice? The truth is that this proposal does not help prevent any conflicts of jurisdiction, and does not provide for any settlement when such situations arise. This could be done, for example, by reducing multiple jurisdiction and by allocating jurisdiction to Member States, as was done through various regulations on civil law, with the obligation to mutually recognise the decisions that followed from that allocation of jurisdiction. Instead, this Framework Decision is limited to a duty of Member States to inform one another and to enter into direct consultation in order to reach 'consensus on any effective solution aimed at avoiding the adverse consequences arriving from parallel proceedings'.
That is why I was not surprised when, during the exchange of views in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs a few weeks ago, the Commission - although supporting the current proposal - mentioned it would come up with a new proposal at a later stage. That is also why I am not surprised by what the Commissioner has said this evening. I thank the Commission for being so honest about the proposal, but have to say that I consider this proposal and the entire procedure for its adoption a good example of how we should not legislate within the European Union. I strongly believe that what is important is to protect our citizens' rights and not just to tick boxes. By the way, the Council is not present today, although the Presidency was one of the initiators of the proposal. I have to stress that within the European Parliament, we took our work very seriously. We worked in good faith during the last mandate and this one, and would hope to be sending a message on our views on having more effective legislation.
Firstly, I believe that the protection of persons formally charged must receive the highest attention and consistent procedural safeguards have to be provided for. These should include the right of the formally charged person to receive enough information for him or her to have a basis upon which to challenge any solution which does not appear to be reasonable. Secondly, with regard to the details concerning the person formally charged, which national authorities exchange through the notifications, I support the idea that it is important to ensure an adequate level of data protection and that it should be specified in this Framework Decision what kind of personal data is exchanged.
Last but not least, I strongly believe that the involvement of Eurojust in the decision on the choice of jurisdiction is of the utmost importance. In my opinion, Eurojust should be involved from the earliest stage because of its coordinating role and because of its more and more relevant tasks. I am among those who consider that we created this Agency not only to show that we are concerned with combating transborder crime, but because we need strong instruments. Eurojust has already proved in the years since its establishment that it deserves our trust. That is why I am surprised by the reluctance shown by the Council and by some colleagues in the European Parliament. Having said that, I would like to call on the European Commission to present at the earliest opportunity a proposal completing this Framework Decision on the conflicts of jurisdiction. I will finish by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the way they worked on this report.
It is essential to put the emphasis particularly on upholding the fundamental human rights of persons involved, in other words suspects and defendants, at all stages of criminal proceedings and, at the same time, also to ensure a corresponding level of personal data protection. We must consequently turn our attention to the Commission's legislative initiative entitled 'Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters', which will apparently solve this problem much more comprehensively. It is essential to support this draft, even though there are practical problems in solving conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings. The progressive alliance of socialists and democrats therefore supports the draft, although we are insisting on the provision of sufficient protection for persons involved in criminal proceedings and, at the same time, a stronger role for Eurojust and greater efficiency for the mechanism as a whole.
(NL) Madam President, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) sees no good in this proposal. The Netherlands, and the Netherlands alone, should be taking decisions on the exercise of jurisdiction. It appears that more and more proposals are being made that ultimately boil down to harmonisation of the criminal law of the Member States. Examples are accreditation of forensic laboratories, harmonisation of the policy on interpreters and the transfer of criminal records. The PVV asks itself where this is all heading. We cannot support a European penal code or a European code of criminal procedure. This looks like salami tactics, where you keep having small slices rammed down your throat until you end up having eaten the whole sausage.
in writing. - The Hague Programme addresses the case of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal matters. This is important when a cross-border criminal activity takes place. Four EU Member States tabled specific proposals with the aim of preventing and settling conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings. The issue relates to when the same person or persons are subject to criminal proceedings in different Member States in respect of the same facts. This may lead to the infringement of the judicial principle ne bis in idem (a person cannot be tried again if he has already been tried). The measures proposed are commendable and consist of:
This Framework Decision should not lead to undue bureaucracy in cases where, for the problems addressed, more suitable options are readily available. Thus, in situations where more flexible instruments or arrangements are in place between Member States, those should prevail over this Framework Decision provided that they do not lower the protection afforded to the suspected or accused person. In cases where the suspected or accused person is held in provisional detention or custody, direct consultations shall aim to reach consensus as a matter of urgency. At all consultation stages, protection of the data of the suspected or accused person must comply with the principles established in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The date I mentioned, 8 October 2004, was almost exactly five years ago. The deadline was five years, but there is no report from the European Commission. Since we all obey the law and the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, is particularly required to obey the law, this gave the Committee on Legal Affairs cause to ask why this report is not available and why it has not even been prepared. We quite simply want to give the Commission the opportunity to justify this to us. In any case, this will make it clear that Parliament, and the Committee on Legal Affairs in particular, is fulfilling in full its obligation to monitor the Commission.
As regards the first two issues that were raised, I am pleased to inform you that work on the preparation of the requested report is already at an advanced stage. The Commission has asked for an external study, which should be ready by the end of this year and will act as a solid factual basis for drawing up the report. The Commission will analyse this study in depth and will listen closely to the opinions of the interested parties. The report could therefore be published during the second half of next year and will be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council.
In fact, one of the main benefits of a European company is that its registered office can be transferred from the Member State where it was registered to another Member State without having to wind down the company or create a new legal entity. However, the European company is far removed from the initial objectives of an autonomous status governed by a single legislation. As a result, its practical operation is inadequate. The legislation is not applied consistently and relies on the specific provisions of the national legislations, while the European company's mobility is restricted by the provisions which ban the establishment of registered offices or head offices in different Member States.
Efficient functioning of the internal market is dependent not only on the elimination of barriers to trade between states, but also on reorganisation of the structure of production at Community level. To this end, in the 1970s, the European Commission put forward a proposal to create a legal framework for a European company. In 2001, Council Regulation No 2157/2001 on the Statute for a European company was adopted. The idea has not produced the expected results, and to date, not many more than 100 firms have been transformed into a Societas Europaea. The idea has evolved, however, towards including small and medium-sized enterprises in the framework of the European company, the fruit of which is the Commission's proposal of March 2008 for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European private company. In view of the negative experience with the Societas Europaea, it is very important that the Commission have permanent oversight of the application of Regulation No 2157/2001. It is for this reason that the regulation itself provides that, five years at the latest after its entry into force, the Commission shall present a report on its application. The regulation came into force in 2004. Therefore, I would like to ask when the Commission will present the appropriate report, and what action will it take on the basis of the analysis made?
(CS) Madam President, the Czech Republic was among those initiating the submission of the draft Council Framework Decision on prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings, and this shows that the Czech Republic attaches considerable importance to judicial cooperation. In view of the sensitivity of the issue, however, it is necessary to ensure that this cooperation operates within the bounds of the authority vested in the European Union by the founding treaty. That is happening in this case. The weak point, on the other hand, is a relatively pronounced generality, for example, in the absence of deadlines for a response from a requested authority and the lack of criteria for determining the most suitable judicial authority for handling criminal proceedings. Another fly in the ointment is the poor integration with Eurojust, which should have been the focus of attention. As the body for European cooperation in judicial matters, there is, lying dormant, a far greater potential for Eurojust than the role it has in the draft framework decision, which does not even stipulate a requirement to inform Eurojust when resolving issues of criminal prosecution of cross-border crimes in a single Member State.
So the G20 leaders get together and they say 'What is the solution? More state intervention.' I suppose, as Mark Twain once observed, that if all that you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. But the truth is that every action they have taken has, at best, been useless and, at worst, has actively deteriorated our situation: the bail-outs, the nationalisations, the pretence of going after tax havens (by which they in fact mean countries with more competitive tax rates than theirs), and the massive extension of state jurisdiction under the pretext of 'contingency'. And now we want to reform the entire financial system. I will close with the words of my late countryman Mr Justice Asprey: 'Reform? Aren't things bad enough already?'
This was on grounds of personal consistency, because back in 2002, when I was a member of the Basque Parliament, it adopted a resolution saying that we considered it necessary to tackle the phenomenon of international capital movements, in accordance with their social and economic impact throughout the world, that we should introduce criteria and mechanisms to provide some mechanisms for monitoring and contributing to human development, to overcoming inequalities between peoples and social sectors, and to environmental balance, and that we had an obligation to set up mechanisms to restrict speculative movements.
For fifty years, European trade and agricultural polices have caused preventable poverty in the Third World. We have simultaneously excluded produce from countries where often agricultural export is the main generator of revenue and, rubbing in the salt, exported our own surpluses - dumped ineffectively our surpluses - on their markets. Then we have tried to salve our consciences by massive aid programmes which have not served to ameliorate the conditions of those countries but, on the contrary, by breaking the distinction between representation and taxation, have served to retard democratic development across much of the world.
(NL) Madam President, the hypocrisy and inconsistency of this House continue to amaze me. On the one hand, this resolution rightly states that it is a shame that the best and most talented people are leaving developing countries, and that this brain drain is harmful to their economy. On the other, there is support across the political spectrum in this House for the EU Blue Card and the European reception centres for legal migration in Africa: the very things that cause and perpetuate this brain drain. After all, experience has shown that 'circular migrants' remain in Europe. Yet there are countless other reasons why I voted against this resolution, such as its plea for more and more EU development assistance. If Europe is to play a role in development cooperation at all, it should be as a coordinator among the Member States and not as a donor.
I voted in favour of the request made by Italy for aid in relation to accessing the European Union Solidarity Fund for rebuilding the Abruzzo region, extensively destroyed by the earthquake in April 2009, based on humanitarian considerations for a country in trouble. Bearing in mind the reason why this instrument exists at European Union level, which is to tackle natural disasters and show solidarity with the regions affected by a disaster, I wish to draw attention to the need for quicker procedures for making the funds requested available to the states affected.
As I have had the opportunity to say before, I believe that solidarity between Member States and, in particular, European support for countries that have been the victims of disasters, constitute a clear sign that the European Union is no longer just a free trade area. By adopting special aid instruments, such as the European Union Solidarity Fund, the EU is demonstrating that it is capable of maintaining unity in the face of adversity, in situations that are particularly demanding in human and material terms. I must therefore welcome and express my support, once again, for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund on this occasion to assist the victims of the earthquake which struck the Italian region of Abruzzo in April 2009.
I voted today in favour of the Böge report on mobilising the Solidarity Fund for Italy. I welcome the fact that this report was included on the agenda, in spite of the difficulties. Parliament's administrative body must anticipate in the future situations like the one we have today. Technical reasons cannot be used to postpone voting on reports which have serious repercussions for European citizens. The European Commission must review the procedures for mobilising the Solidarity Fund with a view to speeding up the payment of grants. An advance payment system must be set up, based on an immediate initial assessment of the direct losses incurred. The final payment must then be made based on the final calculations of the direct losses and on evidence of the prevention measures adopted as a result of the disaster.
The European Commission carried out the preliminary investigation in no time at all, granting Italy the exact amount it had requested, namely EUR 493 771 159. This could well be the highest amount ever granted to date by this fund. With this vote, Parliament is thus showing full solidarity and unity with the affected populations. Normally, it takes an average of around 18 months to mobilise this fund. This time, we have reached the consultation stage in Parliament very quickly, considering that the earthquake happened only five months ago. I therefore sincerely hope that the Commission and the Council will make the timescales for the rest of the procedure as short as possible and will ensure that Italy can access the funds by the end of the year.
in writing. - The effects of the Abruzzo earthquake were devastating and tragic, and the funding which we approved today cannot, of course, compensate for the terrible loss of life or the physical destruction of communities caused by this natural disaster. However, the funding from the EU Solidarity Fund will make a real difference to the region and its long-term recovery, and the existence and effective operation of this fund demonstrates the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union. Programmes and mechanisms to deliver practical measures make us stronger as a union, and better able to cope with crises, whether they be economic downturns or natural disasters. We should continue to support these practical measures to provide assistance to Member States during times of genuine need. Policy enables us to influence and control events, but for those events - such as natural disasters - which go beyond the realm of politics, we can develop these important mechanisms to help us cope with crises.
In the face of a tragedy in which people have lost their loved ones and, in many cases, all of their possessions, and a beautiful town of great antiquity has been ruined, support for such a proposal is a gesture of plain decency. The EU Solidarity Fund is an example of effective, common EU action in a case when one of its members has been hit by such a tragedy. The EU Solidarity Fund allows fast, emergency aid to be given and is, without doubt, a positive signal to its citizens.
Improving judicial cooperation in criminal proceedings between authorities which have parallel competences is a particularly important measure. If the actions which have led to an offence being committed fall under the jurisdiction of two or more Member States, the criminal proceedings must be conducted under the most suitable jurisdiction, with it being essential to create a common, uniform framework for choosing this jurisdiction in an objective, transparent manner. The unsuccessful application of the ne bis in idem principle, which features in the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, violates fundamental rights and runs counter to the EU's objective to create a common space of freedom, security and justice. The report which I voted for underpins the guarantee to respect this principle throughout the entire European judicial area, and not only as part of national proceedings. This is why I welcome the adoption of this report during yesterday's session.
I voted for this report, as matters of conflicts of jurisdiction must be settled as effectively as possible by striving for consensus. We should be pleased that the ne bis in idem principle is ensured in the area of states' courts. It is regrettable that the report does not lay down methods of settling conflicts of competency, determining which state should exercise jurisdiction. The role of Eurojust is also not clearly defined. However, this report is a stimulus to strive for further important decisions in the areas of citizens' freedom, justice and home affairs.
I hope that, in this way, parallel and unnecessary criminal proceedings may be prevented, without, however, leading to increased bureaucracy when dealing with cases in which more appropriate options are quickly available. For example, in cases where more flexible instruments or agreements have already been put in place by Member States, these must take precedence. In fact, the existence of situations in which the same people may be subject to parallel criminal processes, relating to the same events and in different Member States, may lead to violations of the ne bis in idem principle, which must be effectively applied throughout the European judicial area. I also support the increased involvement of Eurojust from the start of the process.
We voted against this report because of the strengthening of the role of Eurojust that it aims to establish. From a legal standpoint, the Council's draft framework decision better safeguards the justice of the decisions taken, above all, because it clearly guarantees the ne bis in idem principle: that a person may not be sentenced twice by the same criminal proceedings. Despite the rapporteur having recognised this fact, the amendments introduced strengthen the role of Eurojust in areas that are the exclusive jurisdiction of the Member States. In this way, and through its anticipated intervention in proceedings, Eurojust is being set up as a higher authority than the Member States, because their chance to come to an agreement on who has authority over proceedings is being taken away from them.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the Weber report on the prevention and settlement of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings. Serious criminal activities have an increasingly cross-border nature and the EU has an important role to play in combating such activities. Clearer procedures for the exchange of information in criminal proceedings will enhance cooperation between Member States and improve individual nations' abilities to combat crime. Regard must always be had for fundamental rights and, in my opinion, the Weber report improves upon the proposed framework decision.
The creation of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis may prove to be essential for preparing the future of the EU. The experience of its members is essential for the pursuit of the tasks and proposals that will be presented by this Special Committee. I believe that the list of members includes members of this House who are respected and very experienced in the various areas affected by the current context of crisis. They will also, therefore, be able to contribute to discussing and presenting relevant measures to correct the faults of the financial system that led to the current situation, making an important contribution to preparing for the possible adoption of properly justified and better legislation in the future.
The world is faced with a contradiction that will be difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job-creating growth. That was the agenda of the G20 in Pittsburgh. On the other hand - and this will be the challenge for the Copenhagen conference - it is just as urgent to combat climate change by reducing energy consumption. In other words, we must restart the machine and ensure that that machine pollutes less. Moreover, these two issues cannot be resolved one after the other; they are both urgent. Relaunching economic activity is urgent, and limiting the consequences of economic activity is urgent. At the G20 yesterday, and at the climate-change conference tomorrow, the European Union must tread a narrow path between two equally formidable threats. The European institutions must be established as quickly as possible under the Treaty of Lisbon adopted by the 27 countries of the Union. By 'playing for time' to delay this moment, the Czech President, Mr Klaus, has a big responsibility towards the 500 million citizens of the Union.
The European Union needs stricter financial market supervision, for which one institution would be accountable (G20). It is important to ensure long-term fiscal stability so that future generations do not have too great a burden and to create more jobs and protect people from the impact of the crisis. It is particularly important to give priority to creating jobs, to ensuring the growth of a large and stable real economy sector, to properly safeguarding capital markets and credit activities, to retaining and stimulating employment, as well as to protecting people from the negative consequences of the crisis, paying particular attention to the poorest and worst affected. Today, we must strengthen social dialogue at all levels by trying to avoid salary reductions and ensure that salaries increase proportionally with productivity growth. The creation of new jobs must be seen as the most important goal.
in writing. - The Verts/ALE Group voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 for several reasons, among which: - by referring to the need to develop new indicators which go beyond GDP, the EP gives a clear signal that 'economic recovery' must not be based on a 'business as usual approach', which is in line with our request to develop a 'Green New Deal'; - the resolution insists on the need to tackle global imbalances, especially exchange rate imbalances and commodity price volatility within a multilateral framework; - the resolution sends a good signal towards the setting-up of a tax on financial transactions, which was never the case until now; - as regards the financial crisis, the EP makes a strong statement on international coordination that should aim to avoid regulatory arbitrage. It also stresses that the upgrading of prudential rules within the context of the G20 consists of a 'minimum harmonisation' approach that must not prevent the EU from applying higher standards; - as regards supervision of the financial sectors, the EP has made a significant move towards an enhanced and more centralised approach on financial market supervision, with the setting up of a single financial supervisory authority being a final objective.
The existence of an agreement on financing and technical support for clean, renewal energy and energy efficiency in developing countries is essential in order to obtain a robust agreement in Copenhagen. It is important to define a concrete model in order to maximise the chances of concluding an agreement in Copenhagen. The international agreement must ensure collective reductions of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report (25-40% for 2020, in relation to 1990) and must establish a long-term reduction for the EU and other industrialised countries of at least 80% by 2050, in relation to 1990.
We have today voted in favour of the resolution on the G20. However, we chose to vote against the introduction of a financial transaction tax, as it would counteract poor countries' capital formation and would hinder the development and growth that has lifted people and countries out of poverty over the last 30 years. We are also opposed to the creation of an anti-cyclical jobs fund at international level, as there is a risk that it will preserve old and obsolete structures, thereby preventing the growth and development of new jobs. It would require the introduction of an international tax and distribution system with no democratic control and with the clear risk of all kinds of corruption. It is important for people affected by the crisis to be able to receive support and help, but this is best handled at national level, not by a bureaucratic international system.
The delegation of the elected representatives of the Mouvement Démocrate (Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - France) welcomes the adoption of the resolution on the G20 conclusions. Through this vote, the European Parliament is reaffirming that: the EU must provide itself with a financial supervision system and a single financial authority; we need to move in the direction of long-term fiscal stability so as not to harm future generations; the immediate priorities must be to create jobs and to protect the citizens against the impact of the crisis. We have voted in favour of Amendments 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13, and regret that the European Parliament did not go further in relation to accounting transparency, the fight against tax havens and environmental commitments ('New Green Deal'). We would also reiterate our commitment to a tax on financial transactions based on the model of the Tobin tax. In this respect, we call on the European Parliament to begin discussions on the definition of such a tax.
I voted for the European Parliament resolution on the G20 Summit, held in Pittsburgh on 24 and 25 September, because I believe that the present economic difficulties must be used as an opportunity to promote the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and reiterate a commitment to fight unemployment and climate change, as well as to create a European strategy that results in economic recovery that is sustainable in the long term. It is, however, regrettable that the proposal for a Tobin-style tax on financial transactions has not been adopted, as that would make it possible to limit excessive speculation, and promote financial stability and investment in the long term.
I am pleased with the agreements that were reached at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. As a result of the globalisation of capital, actions to combat and prevent new crises require the maximum possible international cooperation. I am delighted with the agreements, which have economic growth, the promotion of employment and the regulation of markets in mind, and I hope that these objectives come to fruition 'over a wide area'. As regards the tax on financial transactions to enable excessive speculation to be controlled and encourage long-term investment, it only makes sense if applied on a global scale.
The resolution adopted today is in line with the positions already adopted by various bodies of the European Union, including the European Parliament, in an attempt to hide the true causes of the economic and social crisis and, by manipulating it, to speed up and encourage the continuation and development of the policies that caused it. Among other things, and with regard to tax havens, it only considers that these 'have undermined financial regulation', while merely recommending that it is necessary to 'improve tax transparency and the exchange of information'.
What is required, and what the resolution fails to mention, is the need to break from the neoliberal policies of liberalising and privatising services, of attacking the rights of workers and destroying manufacturing infrastructure. These policies are responsible for the worsening of living conditions, debt, increased unemployment, job insecurity and poverty. It is necessary to value work and workers, to protect productive sectors and public services, to effectively make economic power subordinate to political power, to combat and punish corruption and economic crime, as well as to bring an end to tax havens.
On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I wish to explain our abstention from the vote on the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance's amendment on a tax on the model of the Tobin tax. Our group has decided to set up a working group on this issue in order to clarify the aim and the practical details of this tax. Then, the political groups, in full knowledge of the facts, will be able to agree on a common approach to this issue, one that has the same meaning for everyone and which can be defended within the appropriate international bodies.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. The current economic crisis is truly global in both its roots and its effects, and so coordinated international action is essential to finding solutions. National governments all have a role to play in these solutions and joint action at EU level will ensure that Europe can be at the forefront of driving forward global recovery. The Scottish Government is pushing forward a programme aimed at supporting jobs and communities, strengthening education and skills, and investing in innovation and the industries of the future. Together with the other countries of Europe, we will be able to overcome the challenges we currently face.
in writing. - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the commitment made by the G20 to work on a financial transaction tax. Following the costs incurred by taxpayers during the crisis, it is essential that we ensure the financial sector contributes fully and fairly to an improvement in public finances. The Tobin tax is one model of a financial transaction tax which has been proposed. We did not support Amendment 8 as we must consider all options rather than commit specifically to a 'Tobin-style' tax. Furthermore, the amendment suggests that a unilateral European form of such a tax should be considered. The financial services industry is a global industry and our efforts must remain on securing a transaction tax that is effective and workable on a global level.
The joint motion for a resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh contains a great many positive elements. It plainly points out, for example, the difficulties with the fiscal policy stimulatory measures that have been implemented by the majority of states. The consolidation of national budgets must be given a significant role over the coming years. I also welcome the fact that an attempt is being made to get to grips with the causes of the crisis, with reference being made to unbridled speculation and the lack of regulation in the financial market. This has only been done in a superficial way, however. There is no penetration through to real, needed reforms. Given the immense crisis that we still find ourselves in and that will, sadly, still bring us many more unemployed, this is far too little. It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting.
The motion for a resolution on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh explicitly states that the crisis is the result of reckless and irresponsible risk-taking by some financial institutions in addition to a lack of regulation of the financial market. The door was thus left wide open for total speculation. It is therefore even more important to adopt appropriate rules for the markets quickly. The ideas put forward in this regard in the motion are, on and off, very much to be welcomed. It is unfortunate, however, that the motion also stands behind the Basel II provisions which, we know from experience, have led to the flow of capital to small and medium-sized businesses practically running dry. The rigorous abolition of banking secrecy is not something that I can support, out of consideration for the many small bank customers, for which reason I decided to abstain from the final vote.
The financial crisis arose partly as a result of banks abusing their customers' trust and taking excessive risks with their customers' money. We think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed. We do not think that the Tobin tax will be effective in preventing speculation, but we welcome a discussion on how financial institutions such as banks, trust companies and insurance companies can help to create a healthy and stable financial market. The financial crisis shows that international solutions are needed to tackle international problems. This discussion should therefore be held at global level and not merely within the EU.
It was important for the European Parliament to send out a clear message to the main world leaders following the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. That has been done with the resolution adopted today, which points out that, although the worst of the financial crisis is behind us, the consequences in terms of budget and employment will be felt for a long time yet without joint action from the European Union, the United States and China. The latter have already taken decisions on the reform of the IMF, the supervision of traders' bonuses, capital requirements, and transparency concerning complex financial products, so this G20 was not in vain.
Nevertheless, at least three huge tasks must still be completed if progress is to be made in controlling globalisation. The first is to really tackle tax havens, so much money that is missing from the States' coffers. The second is to prevent a monetary storm from brewing as a result of the failure to rebalance exchange rates and the pursuit of competitive devaluations. The third is to tackle the volatility of the prices of basic commodities, especially foodstuffs, as this plays a part in increasing the imbalances and poverty in the world.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent G20 Summit in Pittsburgh has confirmed a gradual stabilisation of the economic situation. However, it is still necessary to bear in mind problems which may be faced by particular economies. The meeting was an opportunity to confirm the determination of states to reform the system of financial regulation. The greatest danger, which we must not allow, is a further rise in unemployment, a fall in demand and a scaling back of production. The principles proposed in Pittsburgh should be the foundation for common world economic development. The summit has confirmed the need for further work on creating institutions and instruments for inspection and monitoring in a variety of areas of the global market.
The Greek Communist Party voted against the joint motion for a resolution by the conservatives, social democrats and liberals, because it condenses the strategic ambition of the monopolies to pass the painful consequences of the capitalist financial crisis on to the working classes. The political mouthpieces of capitalism are calling in their resolution for the bourgeois governments to continue to support the monopoly behemoths with hot public money and, at the same time, to 'establish healthy public finances', by which they mean even greater cutbacks in social spending, in health, in welfare, in education and so forth. They welcome the creation of 'dignified jobs' which will replace permanent, full-time work with badly-paid, flexible and insecure work, with the minimum possible level of rights. The political representatives of the plutocracy are proposing this 'dignity' to the working classes. The resolution calls for the strengthening of international imperialist organisations (IMF, World Bank, WTO) and paves the way for a 'green' return on capital on the pretext of climate change and the complete liberalisation of international trade, which signals even greater penetration by the monopolies on the markets of developing and poor countries and the plundering of wealth-producing resources and human resources.
The EU has frontloaded EUR 8.8 billion of development aid, budget support and agricultural financing for immediate action, and proposes contributing EUR 500 million to support social spending in developing countries through the FLEX mechanism for ACP countries. It is important that budget support be focused on the fields of health, decent work, education, social services and green growth. The Commission is called on to find new sources of funding to safeguard the European Development Fund (EDF), and it is also important for the EDF to be brought within the Community budget. Increased consistency between the EU's international trade, budgetary, climate change and development policies is also necessary.
It is urgent that all entities that play an active role in public development aid - particularly the institutions of Bretton Woods - respond to the situation rapidly and effectively. It is also essential that the European Union and its Member States take on the responsibilities of frontline actors in development aid by meeting their international commitments to these countries, by an urgent increase in aid to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and by an increase in the volume of public development aid, which is insufficient to react to the collateral damage of this crisis in developing countries.
We are facing an emergency situation with regard to development and humanitarian aid due to the economic crisis, the human cost of which continues to mount up, all the more so as this recession comes in the wake of the food and oil price crises. Unfortunately, one of the direct consequences of the economic crisis is an international donor crisis, against the backdrop of accelerated growth in the level of poverty. In 2009 alone, 90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty, while the number of unemployed has risen by 23 million. A glimmer of hope is offered by the proposals adopted today for providing aid to the most vulnerable countries, the developing countries. However, these do not go far enough, given that the USD 6 billion obtained from the sale of IMF gold reserves and earmarked for providing aid to poor countries can cover only 2% of their actual needs. Consequently, I believe that the pressure must be increased on the G20 States to assume the major specific responsibility for triggering the crisis by mobilising resources in the form of crisis support to be allocated to the developing countries. With this need to streamline the system in mind, I welcome the criticism in the resolution about the failure of the Pittsburgh Summit to tackle the subject of reforming the international financial institutions, given the Bretton Woods institutions' slow response to the crisis.
Developing countries have been severely affected by the present economic and financial crisis and it is feared that they will suffer a sharp slowdown, or even a serious decline, in their growth and progress indices. The EU and the Member States, as significant donors, must keep this fact in mind and consider increasing aid to these countries. The alternative is that some of them drop irreparably into levels of poverty that could bring about or worsen social and political conflicts, and contribute to shortages in regions that have been striving, with difficulty, for peace and development.
Developing countries have been hard hit by the current financial and economic crisis, which was caused by banks and other speculators in the United States. This has a massive impact on their already weak economies and will put millions more people out of work. The unemployed will, where possible, seek their salvation in Europe, thereby increasing the migration pressure on Europe even further. We Europeans must therefore support these countries in building up their economies. The current form of development aid is an unsuitable tool for this purpose, as lots of funds disappear into dark channels or are diverted back into European bank accounts belonging to corrupt despots. For this reason, despite numerous positive ideas, I abstained from voting on the Committee on Development's motion in the final vote.
The financial crisis arose partly as a result of banks abusing their customers' trust and taking excessive risks with their customers' money. We think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed. We do not think that the Tobin tax will be effective in preventing speculation, but we welcome a discussion on how financial institutions such as banks, trust companies and insurance companies can help to create a healthy and stable financial market. The financial crisis shows that international solutions are needed to tackle international problems. This discussion should therefore be held at a global level and not merely within the EU.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Committee on Development's motion for a resolution mentions, all to its credit, the existing global financial and economic crisis has hit the poorest countries hardest. The development targets achieved in many developing countries are at risk and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals seems ever more difficult. Despite the many promises made by developed countries, expressed publicly at the G20 and G8 Summits, for example, the amount of aid sent to developing countries is nowhere near what was pledged. In fact, even before the crisis erupted, the amount of development aid from many EU Member States was far less than what they had promised.
The crisis may also be a new opportunity. The considerable growth in International Monetary Fund resources and changes to that organisation's decision-making system are two reasons for thinking there may be positive developments. The reform of the IMF and the additional resources answer a sore need, but this alone is not nearly enough to ease the situation facing the world's poorest. The developed countries must keep their word regarding their commitment to the Millennium Goals and to the 0.7% of GDP needed to increase development aid. The financing needed to fight and adapt to climate change is an additional responsibility that the developed world cannot afford to wriggle out of. The fundamental pillar of the new international rules must be the notion of more equal opportunities to be involved in revising the rules as well as playing by them.
Madam President, I voted for adoption of the resolution, because I think that it contains many very pertinent remarks on the causes and effects of the current difficult situation in developing countries. I would especially like to stress that the present economic crisis is a result not only of the collapse of financial markets, but also of the earlier food and energy crises. I consider it essential to take action aimed at the rapid and more effective use of means which have been made available by developed countries. This is of particular significance when we consider the fact that wealthy countries are currently struggling with internal problems, such as an insufficient budget or time limitations. I stress once again: it is most important to simplify procedures, so that funds which move from rich countries to poor ones do not disappear in a sea of bureaucracy.
I endorsed with conviction the resolution tabled by the Committee on Development on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries. The EP rightly calls on the EU to eradicate abuses of tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight from developing countries. The IMF has rightly increased the funds for combating the financial and economic crisis. Yet it is downright alarming that, to date, 82% of these resources have ended up in Europe and just 1.6% in Africa. The first priority must now be accorded to poverty reduction. It is also essential that economic partnership agreements (EPAs) be used as a means of giving the countries concerned commercial advantages, and that these countries also be able to leave certain sensitive products and sectors, such as investment and services, out of the negotiations. I regret that the amendment asking the Commission and the Member States to present proposals for innovative funding mechanisms, such as a tax on financial transactions to supplement Official Development Assistance, was not accepted.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution but I feel it is necessary to provide some clarifications. The recent financial crisis has caused a global economic recession which, due to its many repercussions, has had a particular impact on developing countries, exacerbating the food crisis: according to data supplied by the FAO, the number of starving people has reached in excess of the one billion mark for the first time in history, and there are 100 million more malnourished people than there were in 2008.
The impact of the financial crisis on countries in the ACP region has been devastating, making the environmental challenges and the volatility of food prices even more complex. Those countries are not responsible for the crisis, but they have suffered the worst of its consequences, receiving the smallest quantity of aid. This is no longer acceptable. For these reasons, faced with a situation that it is not a cliché to call tragic, I believe it is necessary to improve the quality of the aid that is allocated to those countries, rather than just look at the quantity. I believe it is necessary to act more transparently and effectively when using the funds and I believe it is necessary to verify the results obtained in an impartial manner.
Mr President, a common point that emerged from the debate we had last month on this resolution was that we need to discuss the issue of freedom of expression everywhere, both throughout Europe and outside it. However, we cannot, Mr President, declare a crusade against one individual country. The issue on Italy within this resolution is essentially a national political debate, and we, as the European Parliament, must hold back from intervening in a debate such as this one. If we keep the word Italy within the title of this resolution, we would be assuming the role of some sort of higher court, which we are not, and we would, in fact, be undermining all the authority of and respect towards our institution.
Not every issue in Europe is an issue for Europe. We practise subsidiarity and we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have confidence in our colleagues in the parliament in Rome and trust in the Roman courts, in the Italian courts, which can rule independently on what is good for Italy and what is not good for Italy. The Italian parliament has just proven that it is independent. We are happy to debate freedom of opinion, but then we should also debate freedom of opinion in the European Union. That must be clear in the motion and its title, which is why we are asking for support for our motion.
We should take this opportunity to say clearly - and perhaps you should find an opportunity, like the Council, to say that, because we are against violence, we condemn terrorist violence in general, even if it is directed against the government bodies of Iran. I think that our objective position would be stronger if we said clearly that the attack that cost 42 people their lives is not in keeping with our policy. We are against violence, against the death penalty and also against terrorist violence as a matter of principle.
The dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us, just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future. Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter, both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter, to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese. At that time, we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough.
Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to admit that the Commission has made considerable efforts and progress, showing that it takes Parliament's opinion and wishes seriously. It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million - which, I would remind you, we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget - and set out some of the measures it will implement, such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000, as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September.
The Commission is not part of the solution to the problem, but is actually the problem. We must point out, therefore, that the Commission has caused part of the problems itself by increasing the quantity of milk. It failed to react in any way for months as the crisis went on. The Commissioner told us as recently as four weeks ago that there were no problems, that the market would improve and that we must be patient. This, of all Commissions, is the Commission to which we are handing our powers and this, of all Commissions, is the Commission from which we are expecting help. No, I do not think that is the right way to proceed.
Even yesterday, the Commission was unable to tell us what the additional funds are to be spent on. The Commission talks of restructuring. Over recent years, all restructuring has meant has been fewer and fewer dairy farmers. The Commission has also failed to say how it intends to reinforce the producer organisations going forwards. No, it wants to continue paying out export refunds. We have also heard no answer about how we are to strengthen the producers' position in their struggle against the supermarkets. The Commission was unable to put forward any solution in this regard yesterday either. In the light of all this, we are highly doubtful that the Commission is wholeheartedly working to resolve this crisis. We are writing a blank cheque without knowing what the Commission is doing, how it is doing it and with what it intends to do it.
Yet another issue was the crucial reason for our decision to reject this procedure, however. We, Parliament, have long been fighting for more rights - particularly in the field of agriculture. Yet just as we are on the verge of the Treaty of Lisbon being ratified, the first thing we do is to give these rights away again! That simply cannot be allowed to happen. As a new Member of this House, this strikes me as somewhat extraordinary. We must exercise our rights, we must hold the debates in this House and we must keep our hand on the tiller. We, too, have responsibility here, I am happy to accept that. We must not, however, give up any responsibility. Rather, as parliamentarians, that responsibility is our calling. We must provide the dairy farmers with serious and long-lasting help.
(PL) Mr President, the Schengen Treaty resulted in a qualitative change across the territory of the majority of countries in the European Union. Even though such a short time has passed since it came into force, we often forget what Europe was like when it had borders and the difficulties associated with moving from one Member State to another. The Schengen agreement is another success of our integration but it also bears a great responsibility. Responsibility for a significant part of our land borders has been assumed by the new Member States.
As well as the positive aspects, there are also negative ones, because excessive restrictions have been introduced on the movement of the residents of countries which share a border with the EU, and this means mainly the new countries, such as Poland and Latvia. As a result of these difficulties, there are, among others, serious restrictions on movement across our eastern borders. A new division has arisen, a kind of barrier between countries which had and have close relations resulting from a shared history, family connections and, above all, because they are neighbours.
in writing. - I support the conclusion of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency by the European Community. The International Renewable Energy Agency aims to become a centre of excellence for renewable energy, which will enable it to help governments harness renewable energy sources, to disseminate know-how and best practice, and to provide training in this field. It is thus desirable for the Community to be represented in an institution whose goals coincide with an area of its competence, and whose Statute has already been signed by 20 Member States.
I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation repealing certain obsolete Council acts in the field of the common agricultural policy, as it is necessary to eliminate acts that are no longer relevant from the acquis communautaire in order to improve the transparency and legal certainty of the Community's legislation, in view of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making by the European Parliament, Council and Commission. This was recently reaffirmed in the Commission's communication entitled 'A simplified CAP for Europe - a success for all'; I am responsible for the European Parliament report on this communication, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. Within the scope of this strategy, therefore, it is worth removing acts that no longer have any real effect from the legislation in force.
in writing. - The issue voted on refers to the need of the European Institutions to repeal Council Acts which have, through the passage of time and the development of technology, become obsolete and irrelevant to the correct functioning of the Union. This vote refers to certain Council Acts in the field of the Common Agricultural Policy. I believe that certain aspects of the CAP have long been in need of review. If the policy is to be correctly implemented and used for the benefit of European citizens, the Acts which it has created must be relevant to the world of agriculture as it is today. It is also my firm belief that something must be done to rid the Union of its red-tape image amongst the people of Europe. Acts such as these serve simply to confuse, without serving any real purpose. Aspects of EU policy such as this tarnish the image of the Union amongst its citizens and discourage people from interacting with it. In conclusion, it is my firm belief that if the Union wishes to remain relevant, then modernisation of its laws and policies must always be voted in favour of.
I would like to explain my vote on the draft Council Regulation repealing a number of obsolete Council Acts relating to the Common Agricultural Policy. During the process of European integration, many acts were passed in the European Parliament and the Council. At the time of our accession to the EU, the acquis communautaire numbered almost 80 000 pages of text, half of which related to agriculture. It is therefore a good thing that EU bodies have agreed on an interinstitutional basis that Community law must be updated and condensed.
Laws that have no lasting significance should be eliminated from the acquis communautaire in order to improve the transparency and certainty of Community law. The Commission lately declared 250 agricultural laws obsolete. We are now talking about 28 acts that have no use from a practical perspective but which still formally exist, and six acts that are obsolete. Although I supported this draft, I strongly believe that there are still further opportunities for slimming down European law and cutting back the Brussels bureaucracy and I am therefore asking the Commission to continue its work on the simplification of European law.
in writing. - Laboratory tests must be carried out in order to identify harmful organisms that are not present within the EU. The regulations currently in place do not allow for certain laboratories to which such work can be delegated to take on this work due to the fact that they fall short of Article 2(1)(g)(ii) of Directive 2000/29/EC. I am in favour of allowing such laboratories to conduct this kind of work so long as certain conditions are complied with. Therefore, I have voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - The Government of Malta should follow similar initiatives for the island of Gozo. All EU Member States which have island regions have applied for similar measures and have been given the opportunity by the EU to take such special measures. The measures themselves differ from island region to island region. They have, however, one thing in common: that is, to provide economic comfort to balance the negative aspects of island regions. The island of Gozo suffers from severe handicaps including double insularity, remoteness, small size and difficult topography. Countries much larger than Malta, such as Portugal, Italy and Greece, have been able to obtain special measures so as to provide attractive incentives to island regions. The smaller islands of the Maltese archipelago are particularly vulnerable.
I voted in favour of the Hübner report on the proposal for a Council decision authorising Portugal to apply reduced rates of excise duty in the autonomous region of Madeira on locally produced and consumed rum and liqueurs and in the autonomous region of the Azores on locally produced and consumed liqueurs and eaux-de-vie. Bearing in mind the specific features of these outermost regions, I believe that this extension is vital for the survival of the local industry in these products and for the protection of employment in this sector.
The proposal approved in today's plenary sitting by an overwhelming majority allows for an extension to the concession granted in 2002 authorising Portugal to apply reduced rates of excise duty in Madeira on locally produced and consumed rum and liqueurs and in the Azores on locally produced and consumed liqueurs and eaux-de-vie. Since the beginning of this process, I have done everything possible to ensure that this measure, which had expired at the end of 2008, would be renewed as a matter of urgency. Having secured the unanimous support of the Committee on Regional Development, this result was confirmed by today's vote, which maintains the tax reduction with effect from January 2009 until 2013.
The coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the broadcasting of television programmes is vital for the creation of a media space where the main theme is unity in diversity. It is just as important for us to be able to make European legislation as accessible as possible to all citizens. The report on the proposal for the Audiovisual Media Services Directive in its codified form, tabled before the plenary session, is purely a technical and legal measure whose benefits are, however, unquestionable. Codifying legislation which is constantly changing is a measure that gives Community law greater clarity and transparency, making it easier for EU citizens to understand. In this case, the codification proposal involves replacing the old 1989 directive with a new directive (without modifying the content) to which the acts that have supplemented it over the years have been added. I supported this initiative because, apart from its technical nature, we cannot overlook its value in supporting the proper operation of audiovisual media services, not to mention in terms of transparency as well.
From the perspective of Europe's citizens, a simplification and clarification of Community law contributes to greater legal certainty and, in my opinion, the codification carried out in the directive is therefore a step in the right direction, leading to the effective application of positive law. At the same time, I agree that a harmonisation of principles at the Community level will contribute not only towards guaranteeing security of supply, but also towards the stabilisation of an internal market where internal border controls have been removed and towards protecting animals entering the Community.
I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens. EU citizens and Mauritian nationals who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements. The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories.
I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Republic of the Seychelles, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens. EU citizens and Seychelles nationals who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements. The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories.
I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and Barbados, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens. EU citizens and nationals of Barbados who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements. The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories.
The reports before us in connection with the agreements between the European Community and numerous small island nations such as Mauritius and Barbados envisage a visa waiver where citizens of the Contracting Parties travel to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of three months during a six-month period. I reject these relaxations of entry requirements and therefore voted against the conclusion of these agreements as the retention of the requirement for a visa certainly represents an obstacle to criminality and thus severely restricts unwanted immigration.
I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens. EU citizens and the nationals of the Federation who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements. The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories.
I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and Antigua and Barbuda, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens. EU citizens and nationals of Antigua and Barbuda who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six- month period will be exempt from visa requirements. The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories.
I support this agreement negotiated between the European Community and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, establishing a visa exemption for entry and short stays in order to facilitate the movement of their citizens. EU citizens and nationals of the Bahamas who travel to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of three months within a six-month period will be exempt from visa requirements. The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are not bound by this agreement, and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands, for which this agreement only relates to those countries' European territories.
Thus, in view of the possibility that the Commission may submit amending budgets in the case of 'unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances', which include the earthquake in Italy, I voted in favour of this report on the amendment to the European Union budget, so that the residents of the affected region will see the damage caused by the earthquake repaired more quickly, and a swift return to normal living conditions effected through the mobilisation of EUR 493.78 million from the EU Solidarity Fund.
Since the mobilisation of EUR 493 771 159 from the European Union Solidarity Fund has been approved in favour of Italy, and since this fund does not have its own budget, it is necessary to amend the Community budget to ensure that the amount agreed is made available. Although we agree upon the need to provide the funds as quickly as possible, we regret that the proposal presented by the European Commission implies, among other budget headings, a reduction in funding for important community programmes compared with the previous and current multiannual financial framework.
Examples of this include the projected reductions in the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance - Community programmes from the previous Community framework, 2002-2006 - or LIFE+, the Financial Instrument for the Environment. In our view, beyond the necessary adjustments to the Solidarity Fund to give it a budget heading with its own resources, it should not receive funding at the cost of the aforementioned Community programmes while, at the same time, there is an insistence on increasing expenditure for military and propaganda purposes. The funds now being allocated to the Solidarity Fund could preferably have been taken from those headings instead.
I agree that there should be additional support for workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market. It is essential that financial assistance to workers made redundant is made available as quickly as possible, and that European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) money, vital for the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market, is used more effectively. I would like to underline that Member States should provide more detailed information on the implementation of important gender equality and non-discrimination objectives by means of EGF-financed measures.
Unemployment is one of the main problems affecting the European Economic Area. Even before the emergence of the current financial crisis, which has increased and aggravated some of the earlier symptoms, the serious impact of globalisation and the resulting relocation of businesses on many people's lives were clear to see. The particular difficulties of the times in which we are living are obvious when we add to these problems the present lack of confidence in the markets and the shrinking of investment. In that respect, although I am in favour of internal market regulation, I believe that the exceptional nature of the crisis justifies exceptional countermeasures.
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is one of the tools that the European Union has at its disposal for helping unemployed workers under these circumstances. I believe that the case of the workers from Nokia GmbH, in the German region of Bochum, justifies European aid, as was previously given in Portugal. Aside from this aid, which is undeniably useful, the European Union must also take steps to promote a more robust and creative European market that will generate investment and jobs. That is the only way to tackle this problem effectively, seriously and sustainably.
in writing. - Mr President, I voted in favour of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund's (EGF) investment of nearly EUR 5.6 million in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region, which has suffered from mass redundancies since the 1990's. As a result of the Finnish telecommunications company Nokia closing its production plant in Bochum in 2008 and relocating to more cost effective market areas, 2 300 more people in the region were made redundant. Being a Finn, I take a special interest in the plight of the workers who have lost their jobs due to the cessation of Nokia production in Bochum. The closure of the Nokia plant in Bochum was indeed the latest in a string of events compounding unemployment in the region. For this reason, I wholeheartedly welcome the investment from EGF in the region as a way of improving employment opportunities for the people of North Rhine-Westphalia.
We denounce this idea of globalisation 'adjustment', since this is how the European Union refers to social and human tragedies such as this, which see companies that post record profits relocate in order to make more profit, thus ruining the lives of hundreds of workers and an entire region. This charitable remedy (the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund) that is being proposed will not make people forget that the European Union is, in fact, directly responsible for the tragedy being suffered by the redundant employees, because of its choice of free and fair competition. Rather than supporting these 'adjustments' to all the huge uncertainties of the globalised capitalist economy, the European Union should prohibit such practices and protect European citizens.
This report is in favour of mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) following redundancies in Germany. I fully approve of mobilising this fund - we need it in this instance - and so, like the majority of my fellow Members, I voted in favour of this report. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is one of the mechanisms that the European Union has available to it to help unemployed workers who have been made redundant as a result of the negative effects of globalisation. I believe that the case of the Nokia GmbH employees and of the German region of Bochum warrants mobilisation of European aid, just as it has already been mobilised previously for Portugal.
Yesterday, in the Council of Agricultural Ministers and in COMAGRI, I also announced this EUR 280 million for dairy farmers. In order to be able to pay out this money quickly, I simply need the legal basis in Article 186. The idea will be to allocate the money in national envelopes, according to production in the year 2008-9 and, of course, within the ceiling of the national quotas, distributed in a non-discriminatory manner to those dairy farmers most affected by the crisis. Again, to use this possibility, we need to include milk in Article 186.
When I say I announced the possibility of proposing EUR 280 million, you have to be aware that the budget authority, which is the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers, will have to decide on this amount at the ECOFIN meeting on 19 November. I also said yesterday that this is the last money that I have in my pockets, with the exception of the EUR 300 million which is necessary as a buffer to avoid financial discipline. It is important for me to say clearly to you that Article 186 is not a carte blanche to propose whatever ideas the Commission might get. At this stage, I can only say that private storage for different products - and this could include cheese - is a candidate, provided that the market situation is such that we can justify it.
The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely. The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all. Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council. Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas. The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say that I certainly welcome this decision, and I think the debate last night in the committee and tonight in plenary allows us to bring more clarity to the situation. The reality, and I think the cause of the frustration that many dairy farmers feel, is that while they have seen to some extent what Mr Lyon referred to as the green shoots emerging, this money has not passed through into their bank accounts yet. So this does create a degree of frustration for the dairy farmers. Many have been under financial pressure for a long time. It is a good and useful thing that we can talk, because I do now accept the need for Article 186 to be brought into place so that we can get this money direct to the producers as fast as we possibly can. I think that is the challenge.
The fact is, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is being pitched so strongly to us, we can only be surprised that you should want to enforce this Article 186 of the regulation, which will give you full powers. You had these full powers, though, and it was these that led you to opt for the liberalisation of quotas that is plunging us into the crisis that we are in today, for the sole benefit of manufacturers and distributors, because, even today, the European Court of Auditors points out that, between 2000 and 2007, the consumer prices of milk products increased by 17% while the producer prices fell by 6%.
(HU) Commissioner, I will, of course, vote in favour of the proposal, even though I am aware that this handout will not resolve the situation for farmers. However, I have three questions to ask. The first one is as follows. What do you see as the lesson from this crisis? Have we learnt any lesson from it? Commissioner, this crisis has not been caused by any kind of natural disaster, tsunami or other similar event, but by a series of bad decisions and a basically failed agricultural policy. Looking at the future, what can you promise farmers? How will they avoid a similar crisis in the future? I would like to hear a clear-cut, detailed answer from you.
Now for my next question. You said yesterday at the Committee hearing that Member States can freely use this sum of money. What does this mean exactly? Will Member States be able to distribute this money fairly so that it is not given to farming's big business and large farms, but to smallholders, family farmers who are most in need and whose livelihood depends on it? These farmers have ended up in the direst situation. The other large group that should be considered are farmers in the new Member States, especially smallholders. How do you want to get rid of this intolerable discrimination which derives from the fact that we Hungarians, for instance, had to hand over our markets lock, stock and barrel to the European Union, but we have received only a fraction of the subsidies? How and when will this injustice and inequity be eliminated?
That leaves us with little choice but to welcome the Commission's initiatives, however inadequate they may seem to us. That was also why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament voted this morning in favour of the urgent procedure that was put before us. We will, however, propose and demand that the European Parliament be kept permanently informed of the measures which will be adopted over the coming days, under the powers which we now transfer to the Commission. We will continue to do our utmost to restore the balance of the market, so that it can guarantee adequate returns to the producers, as reaffirmed in the Treaty of Lisbon.
(DE) Mr President, unfortunately, Mr Bové cannot be here tonight, so I am speaking again. I have more questions for the Commissioner. Does she really, seriously believe that paying out this money will end the protests? As I said earlier, I believe that Parliament's decision this morning equated to granting the Commission a blank cheque because we do not know what it will do with it. I will say it again: the Commission is not part of the solution to the problem, but is actually part of the problem. I stand by that view.
I have another question for you, Commissioner, as it is repeatedly said for all the programmes that we need to continue to promote restructuring. So what do you mean by restructuring? Do you really think it is right that we continue to give out money in order basically to encourage smaller-scale farmers to give up so that we can give money to the bigger farms? This policy is no longer an effective means to an end. We must ensure that we employ the money in a targeted way, specifically in the disadvantaged regions, in order to maintain the structures in those regions that are in greatest jeopardy.
Mr President, the dairy industry is in crisis, and I want to record my thanks here and compliment the Commissioner on her very timely actions, which I think were precisely right. I think EUR 280 million is a realistic sum and will be welcome within the industry. I am persuaded that it will be necessary to grant powers under Article 186 in order to deliver this benefit in a timely manner to the producers, so it has my support. It has my support, although I prefer that we limit this concession until 2013 at the latest.
Personally, I am in favour of maintaining the quotas, but only when the breakdown of quotas among EU countries and producers is based on objective and fair criteria. The development and adoption of such fair and objective criteria would be very difficult, but perhaps it is worth making the attempt. If we are talking about extension - I fully support the extension of Article 186, but I think this should be accompanied by a definition of the role of the Commission and the instruments it will be able to use.
The EUR 280 million milk fund announced yesterday is welcome but is merely a sticking plaster over a much wider problem. The House voted last September that EUR 600 million should be made available. In the interests of showing solidarity with small farmers in particular, this figure should be maintained. The next priority for the Commission must be to address the whole issue of milk supply. I firmly believe this. Until this is addressed, we will be facing more problems and we are quickly going to run out of sticking plasters.
The Commission now has the chance to act quickly and we should grant it this chance and in so doing, we should always demonstrate our own willingness to hold it to account. Mr Deß's amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will enable us to do that together. The EUR 280 million that many have spoken about is just a drop in the ocean. We must also recognise, though, that it is the end of the financial year. We have to understand that there simply is no more money available.
How should we handle the overall situation? We would like to see those dairy farmers who have been hardest hit by the crisis receive the EUR 280 million. We talk about the milk market, but these are real people and the rural areas that we discuss and that we are always saying we want to protect when we are debating other subjects. Commissioner, support the dairy fund! This afternoon, the Commissioner speaking in the budget debate spoke out in favour of the fund, I want to make that quite clear. I was very pleased about it. We also need this signal urgently, and this money, too, is within the 2010 budget.
The measures proposed here are somewhat flimsy, but they are nonetheless necessary and imperative. I am also worried about how the Commission will use the new powers it is to be given, especially since it has acted in quite an insensitive way in this crisis, putting forward weak measures, too late, and only under intense pressure. In view of this, I would like the Commission to submit an annex to Article 186, setting out measures which can be used for a radical intervention in the dairy sector so as to ensure its sustainability.
A programme of this kind, if it is to succeed, must be obligatory, not voluntary. I find this voluntary arrangement to buy back milk quotas counterproductive. I believe this not only because this arrangement will initially mean that we retain a quota increase which it will then be very difficult to rein back in. By buying back the milk quotas, we will be giving them a financial value again, and the main effect of that will be that it hampers the ability to do the balancing out. I feel I must reject any measure that restricts balancing out. Particularly in the phasing out period for the milk quotas, balancing out is a necessary tool in order for individual farms to be able to orient themselves better in the market.
(RO) I would like to ask the Commissioner a question, as well as thank her for appearing before the House. You said that the resources promised for the funds to support the dairy sector will be allocated to Member States according to an historical factor, in other words, based on the negotiated quotas. However, many Member States claim that these quotas are unfair. In fact, this is the reason why many Member States insist that the market should be deregulated. For example, some states cannot even produce enough to cover their own consumption. Do you not think that using an historical factor will maintain these injustices...
(BG) I would like to welcome the decision made by the Council and Commission to allocate an additional package of EUR 280 million in subsidies for dairy production in 2010. This sends out a clear signal to all those who are suffering the adverse consequences of the crisis every day. I urge that this adequate response will not be a one-off economic solution, but part of a targeted, long-term strategy for restoring, stabilising and developing this sector in Europe. This is why it is important to take into consideration the measures which each Member State is going to adopt. I would like to draw attention to the fact that Bulgaria can only partially accept the proposals to amend Regulation 1234. We insist that it is explicitly recorded in the draft that the opportunities to manage national milk quotas will be exercised at Member States' discretion. It is important that the option is retained to choose the existing scheme for buying up and redistributing milk quotas through the national reserve. We can ill afford either to hold back or collect payment from producers as the Bulgarian sector is in the process of being modernised. Otherwise, Bulgarian producers will not be competitive even after 2015.
(PL) Mr President, we are, of course, pleased to accept these new solutions, which are intended to help farmers, including farmers in Poland. However, it should also be remembered that when we are talking about money - and it is money which we are talking about - the way in which the money is actually distributed is important. It should reach those who are feeling the effects of the crisis the most, because I will not agree to a policy under which we give everyone an equal amount, which means a small amount, so that, in fact, quite literally, we do not help anyone.
Secondly, I would like, if I may, to refer to history before turning to the future in a moment. I am sure we remember the wonderful years, over a year ago now, when the farmers were getting a very good price for milk. At the same time, they were benefiting from large EU subsidies for modernisation of the dairy sector. Therefore, it is important that we plan the future based on this experience, and that we draw conclusions from our mistakes, because mistakes were certainly made. It is equally important for us to think about how to plan the development of this sector, since money is available both as direct subsidies and also for the development of rural areas. In addition, we have the instrument of milk quotas at our disposal.
(PL) Commissioner, I would like to ask you this question: What does the Commission want to spend the EUR 280 million on? On further restructuring, or better, perhaps, as 21 Member States wanted, on an injection for the market, on market mechanisms? In fact, the farmers want the money to be used for support mechanisms. Currently, they are not able to take out further loans or to improve productivity. They are not able, at the moment, to continue with modernisation, because they have lost liquidity. They do not want to buy refrigerators or milking machines now, this is not the time for further investment. The EUR 280 million works out at not quite EUR 2 per tonne of milk produced in the European Union.
I have to say that the proposal concerning the buying back of quotas leaves me more perplexed. You yourself said over weeks and months that the current crisis was not caused by the quota system and, with that in mind, personally I do not think that this buy-back proposal is completely coherent. Finally, I would also like to say that this cannot be the end of the line just yet. We must continue to take steps, and specifically as regards the dairy sector in difficult areas, in mountain areas, where there are simply no alternatives to dairy farming.
Commissioner, Austria was always against the phasing out of the quotas. OK, you have chosen your path and followed it consistently. We will, of course, attempt to prepare our farmers for it and to help them with it as much as possible. With the best will in the world, I cannot understand your proposal for a voluntary quota buy-up programme. If we apply this, it will result in an appreciation in value and price of exactly the quotas that you are phasing out. How are we supposed to explain that to the farmers of Austria?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, having listened carefully to the discussion here tonight, I think you might get the impression from some speeches that this is the first step we are taking to help the dairy sector within the European Union. Nothing could be more wrong. I am quite sure that at least some of you know what has been going on since January this year when we started on the public and private storage, we started intervention, and we started export refunds. We have been taking lots of different measures over the summer so I think we should devise a special study to tell the new Members of this Parliament exactly what has been going on since last January.
On the specific points on the two proposals here today, I have to repeat again that the buy-up scheme is not a new scheme. It is already there for Member States to use if they want to help specific dairy farmers out of business. It is an offer, and that is why I do not want to make it compulsory; it is a possibility for helping farmers out of business. The quota they buy out can be kept in the national reserve and distributed at a later stage if Member States so wish. This was one part of the discussion.
The other part, which has aroused by far the most interest today, is Article 186. The reason for introducing dairy farming into Article 186 is the fact that we need to be able to react fast. By the way, I do not see any reason why dairy farming should not be part of Article 186, as areas specifically within the meat sector are already there. And, in general, those who fear that the Commission will get a blank cheque and do whatever they want should keep in mind that Article 186 is normally by nature a very positive scheme where it is possible to try to help people who are in difficulties by reacting very fast. So it is not a blank cheque. It will be discussed, as you probably know, in the Management Committee.
Then I think there are lots of mistaken ideas going round. This EUR 280 million is not for restructuring. It simply offers a possibility of paying out very quickly as soon as we have the formalities in place, with the acceptance from the Ecofin meeting in November and the signing of the budget for 2010. This means we can act immediately, which would not be the case if we do not have Article 186 in place. So it is not restructuring. As I said before, it gives Member States the possibility of paying the most needy from this national budget.
The rallies that milk producers have been carrying out for weeks in a bid to save their crisis-hit sector have been answered by the European Commission with the creation of a EUR 280 million 'milk fund'. Mrs Fischer Boel has therefore succumbed to the pressure after turning a deaf ear, for weeks on end, to the distress of farmers on the brink of bankruptcy. However, this financial measure is derisory and is intended merely to calm the producers down for a while. It will do nothing to solve the problem of a sector that is on its way out with the planned end of milk quotas. Milk producers do not want charity or handouts, they want the market to be regulated so that they can sell their milk at prices that will allow them to live a dignified life from their efforts and to guarantee their children's future. Through its stubborn desire to impose the dogma of free and fair competition, the European Union is going to leave thousands of farmers at the mercy of the law of the market, and that alone. This is the same ultraliberalism that each month makes thousands of industrial workers unemployed. The carnage must be stopped now as a matter of urgency.
I welcome the agreement in principle reached by agricultural ministers at their council meeting in Luxembourg on providing specific aid to the dairy sector of EUR 280 million. At EU level, this amounts to an additional one cent in aid per litre of milk, which is absolutely negligible. After putting up bold resistance for several months, the European Commission gave in slightly to the pressure exerted by farmers, 21 Member States, including Hungary, and the European Parliament, which already demanded additional resources for the sector during their informal meeting held in Brussels last Monday. In spite of the tardy measures from the EU, the Hungarian Government has acted quickly to support dairy farmers and has done everything to help them, taking into account the budget resources available. Hungary has helped the dairy sector by using all the sums that can be reallocated as part of rural development resources and the European Economic Development Programme. Apart from us, only Latvia and Malta have such outstanding indicators. Hungarian dairy farmers will receive directly around EUR 3.3 million from the EUR 280 million envelope, roughly equivalent to HUF 890 million. The Hungarian government can freely decide how to use this money. The Commission only made the suggestion that the most needy producers should receive this special aid, which coincides with Hungarian objectives. Following approval of the 2010 budget, this sum will be paid out at the start of next year.
Mr Sassoli, you raised the issue of inadmissibility, under Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure. As a result, the Presidency, namely President Buzek, has examined this matter in depth, as you can imagine. He has based his analysis on the following principles. First of all, the amendments to which you refer, namely Amendments 7, 8 and 9, are directly related to the text which they intend to modify. Secondly, they do not aim to delete or replace the entire text. Neither do they alter various paragraphs in the text nor can it be claimed that they do not affect all the language versions.
I do not believe that failing to mention the name and surname of the President of the Italian Republic will change a great deal, given that it is the President of the Italian Republic who is the subject of these amendments. I think this is something of a ritual where our work is concerned; I have never seen MEPs from other countries cite the Queen of England or the President of Germany in our resolutions for what may appear to be exploitative reasons. Therefore, I would simply ask that Amendments 7, 8 and 9 to the resolution be withdrawn.
'whereas the European Parliament shall not accept double standards; whereas, in order to put political pressure on journalists disclosing corruption cases linked to high-ranking officials and ruling party politicians, the Government administration in Hungary has recently introduced steps to launch criminal proceedings against such members of the media;' - namely Mr Tamás Pindroch, the journalist from the Magyar Hírlap - 'whereas bearing in mind in particular that criminal proceedings were launched against the journalist who was investigating the scandals of a high-ranking former member of the government and one of the candidates for European Commissioner; whereas this has resulted in an atmosphere where the press is under political pressure in Hungary'.
Mr President, honourable Members, as you know, our relations with the US and the transatlantic cooperation between the US and the EU are extremely important. It is a cornerstone of EU foreign policy, founded on the values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and international law, which is something that unites us. The new administration in the United States has shown great interest in deepening and extending links with us in Europe. We will have the first Transatlantic Economic Council with President Obama's administration on 26-27 October. Shortly after that, on 3 November, there will be a summit between the EU and the US. These are two important opportunities to strengthen our relations. Today's debate is therefore very important.
I would like to say a few words about the economic partnership and the Transatlantic Economic Council, the TEC. This will provide us with a mechanism at the highest possible level to speed up current negotiations and establish new areas for regulatory cooperation. We need to draw up a work programme for the TEC that can be established next year. That will give us a forum for cooperation, where we can deal with issues relating to globalisation and rapid technical changes. Up to now, it has been an important forum but it could, of course, be better, not least when it comes to the broader strategic issues relating to the transatlantic economy and common economic challenges. The Transatlantic Economic Council is even more important today in light of the financial crisis.
Allow me now to say a few words about legal and police cooperation. For a while now, we have had cooperation with the United States in this area, which is reflected in a number of agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance which will enter into force in a few months. We often discuss this with the European Parliament, which I know is an active and committed partner on these matters - often a critical partner, too, which is a good thing. In this regard, I only need remind you of the debate on passenger name records, for example. Once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, the European Parliament's influence on, and involvement in, these matters will increase.
Thirdly, on foreign policy, we will, of course, also discuss with the US how to meet urgent foreign policy challenges. Here we will focus on how to cooperate further and more closely on the Middle East peace process, on the challenges posed by the nuclear ambitions of Iran, and on ways in which we can assure the renewal of the compact in Afghanistan, which is at the basis of our concerted efforts there. I will have a separate foreign policy meeting with Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Bildt to discuss these matters in greater detail.
Last but not least, a further major summit outcome will be the creation of a new EU-US Energy Council which will have its first meeting on 4 November. On the EU side, the Council will be chaired by myself, my colleagues, Commissioners Piebalgs and Potočnik, and the Presidency, and on the US side by Secretary Clinton and Secretary Chu. The Council will look at global energy security, energy markets and product regulation, at new technologies and research. In short, it will provide added value in a policy field, the importance of which is obvious.
My colleague has already mentioned that GLS will also be very important. There will be a Troika meeting on GLS affairs on 27 and 28 October in Washington, in the framework of our cooperation on justice, freedom and security. Vice-President Barrot will represent the Commission. We are in the final stages of preparing a statement that will aim to renew our transatlantic partnership in these areas. In the Washington meeting, there will be the opportunity formally to exchange the instruments of ratification of the extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements so that they can enter into force in early 2010. These agreements will strengthen our efforts in fighting crime in today's globalised world.
On another critical matter close to the hearts of the citizens, we certainly need to make further progress, as was mentioned. We will reiterate the call for visa-free travel to the US for all EU citizens; we will express our concern over the prospect of a fee for the electronic system for travel authorisation as the de facto new tourist tax; and we will once again remind the US of the need to lift the restrictions on travellers with HIV/AIDS under the US visa waiver programme, as you have mentioned.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, I have just noticed that gender mainstreaming has become a feature of this House. We must be aware that the issue of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) is a very important one and that the body which was established a few years ago needs a new driving force, because we are in a transition period with a new administration in the US and soon a new Commission. I hope that the meeting next Tuesday will ensure that the TEC continues and that it has the appropriate spirit.
A transatlantic market with no trade barriers would result in economic growth of 3.5% in the US and Europe and 1.5% worldwide. In the context of this economic crisis, this issue is very closely linked with jobs. For this reason, we should make the most of this opportunity and explain in public statements that we are taking this initiative seriously. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, we should also make sure that security policy in the field of energy is handled by the new energy security council and that the regulatory issues are dealt with in the TEC. It is important that these two areas are not mixed together in order to prevent duplication and to ensure that we have a solution at the end of the day.
One area which has already been touched on and which we could discuss this morning is the central issue of climate policy. Many of us will be in Washington in the next few days, where we will have the opportunity to hold discussions with our colleagues from Congress. Although the legislation concerning climate policy has not yet been passed, the representatives of the US Government are at least partly authorised to make binding undertakings, even if the details cannot be finalised until after the US legislative process has been completed.
Finally - and this has also already been mentioned - regardless of our friendship and mutual affection and regardless of our good relationship, there are certain things that we cannot accept. These include the repeated protectionist measures, for example, in the market for defence equipment, the discriminatory visa policy aimed at some Member States and the visa charges demanded by the US which have already been referred to. It is important that we talk to the US from a position of equality. It is important to establish a partnership, but also to explain what we cannot accept, which in this case, is a policy that discriminates against Europeans.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of the ALDE Group, I strongly welcome the fact that this resolution calls for a strengthened strategic partnership between the EU and the US as a cornerstone of EU external policy. It also rightly reiterates the role of an integrated transatlantic market by 2015. We must not let the trees of myriad disagreements on specific issues obscure the wood of an overwhelming interest in common values and objectives, and action on promotion of democracy and human rights, resolution of conflicts and protection against security threats among others.
On the economic side, the ALDE Group has emphasised the need to avoid regulatory arbitrage in the financial sector and to address issues such as 'too big to fail' institutions. We have put in an amendment to paragraph 39 since, as far as I can see, there simply was no G2 leaders' agreement to work on a financial transaction or Tobin tax, so it is absurd to welcome such an agreement, even if we have already done so, erroneously, in the G20 resolution.
The ALDE Group also calls for deletion of paragraph 38, which appears to seek the abolition of intellectual property rights. But, as Mrs Malmström has explained, a large part of the transatlantic relationship relates to justice and security matters. The ALDE Group fully supports close cooperation in this area but it must respect fundamental rights, including privacy, and be progressed within a democratic and transparent framework. In that respect, it is a pity that MEPs have not been consulted on the joint statement to be agreed next week - especially as, with the Lisbon Treaty, almost all of these matters come within codecision.
The second point, which has just been mentioned, is the tax on financial transactions. When Mr Barroso was a candidate for re-election to the presidency, he expressly said that he was in favour of such a tax. A fortnight ago, the European Parliament for the first time voted, by a majority, for a tax on financial transactions, provided that they formed part of an international framework. The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States/European Union Summit in early November.
My last point is that on climate, we have a responsibility to remove a thorn from Mr Obama's foot. President Obama wants to act, but he is blocked by his majority. The best thing that the European Union could do for him is to make an undertaking, at the end of October, to provide EUR 30 billion of funding for climate adaptation expenditure in the global South and to commit to a 30% reduction in its own emissions. Once this is done, we will be able to make progress in negotiations. This is our responsibility. We must do it before the summit.
Madam President, deepening relations between the United States and the European Union should be the foundation of EU external policy. After all, the United States has been our closest ally for years. Currently, many challenges are before us, which we must face up to together, shoulder to shoulder with Washington. In the area of security, we are troubled by the attitude of Iran and the worsening situation in Afghanistan. A little closer to our borders, Russia is becoming an increasingly unpredictable and authoritarian neighbour, and the Kremlin is exerting neoimperialistic pressure on the countries which lie just across its borders.
In order to defend and remain faithful to the values which are common to America and Europe, we must always speak with one voice when we have to deal with cases of violations of human rights and threats to citizens' fundamental freedoms. We must be united in defence of our security. We must not forget that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is the foundation of our transatlantic relations. This is why the area of security, freedom and democracy should be extended to include those European countries which increase Euroatlantic security. It is essential for active strengthening of ties with the United States to be a priority for the European Union.
I come from a country where, in the last three years, the government has been suspending human rights and sending people to prison completely without any foundation. In this day and age, they do it in the name of the fight against terrorism. We have 16 very probably political prisoners in prison, charged with terrorism, without any evidence whatsoever. Suspended human rights, habeas corpus, right of defence, prisoners' rights: I know what I am talking about. We have to be very careful when we talk about the fight against terrorism and we have to do it in a very professional and very careful way.
The Parliament also wants two summits to take place every year. If we have two summits with Russia, why not with the United States? Ladies and gentlemen, there is increasing talk of a G2 being set up by the United States and China, that is to say, a privileged relationship between the top global players. It worries me that we Europeans may weaken our role as partners and undermine our privileged relationship with the United States. We must explain to the United States that, in the field of foreign policy, the Union will be strengthened by the Treaty.
The European Union, or the Europe of today, is no longer the problem it had been for decades. Today, in this complex world, Europe should be part of the solution, and I hope that is the way the United States sees the situation. In order for this to occur, as the Commissioner pointed out, Europeans also need to act in line with the global role we want to have, and to be up to the mark, with respect to the privileged relationship to which we aspire with the United States.
Madam President, the transatlantic relations that are crucial for both the EU and the US have been seriously tested in recent years. Now, with a new Administration in the White House which is redefining US priorities, and France back into the NATO military structure, the perspective is better. Personally, I consider that the time is now ripe for a substantive evaluation of transatlantic relations to give them the solid basis they deserve to withstand the current common challenges posed by the international environment - energy, climate change, emerging new powers, the financial and economic crisis, and terrorism.
Security in Europe, for instance, is one such common interest and therefore stands at the heart of transatlantic relations. Even if, for now, war on the continent is not a serious proposition, the culmination of some current negative trends could bring back that possibility if we fail to respond properly. Progress is not irreversible, as we all know so well in central Europe. That is why, before considering a proposal to re-evaluate the current security architecture of the continent, we should try to have definite answers as to the continuation of US involvement, the future of NATO and the role expected of the EU after the Lisbon Treaty comes into force.
Collaborating on innovations for the development of low-carbon economies and energy efficient societies is particularly important. In addition, it is also important to involve various stakeholders more closely, such as the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, a forum consisting of 80 consumer organisations. These organisations could help to make consumer protection a central theme in the dialogue about regulation of the financial markets. The objective of establishing a common transatlantic market by 2015 may be too ambitious, but it must be judged on the basis of the fact that it will improve the lives of people on both sides of the Atlantic. This is why the Greens are in favour of a transatlantic new deal.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you believe that the European Union needs partners, as all the previous speakers have said, then this becomes particularly clear in the area of the economy. The transatlantic market has a trade volume of around EUR 2 billion per day. This makes it obvious how important the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is. It also becomes clear that free trade agreements are important and, above all, that we must focus more closely on the transatlantic partnership.
I am sometimes concerned about what is happening on the other side of the Atlantic when I look at the new President. He will find the time to accept the Nobel prize in Oslo, but it was difficult for many European Heads of State or Government to get appointments to meet with him on the fringes of the G20 Summit. He had time in Copenhagen to support his home city's Olympic bid, but unfortunately he did not have time to join us in an important European celebration, in other words, the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the iron curtain. I would be pleased if we succeeded in convincing him that he should not wait until a few days beforehand to decide whether the TEC meeting should take place, but instead that he should support the TEC with complete conviction over the next few years.
We need trade between Europe and the US to be made easier. We need improvements in the area of joint standardisation. We need the removal of duties and non-tariff trade barriers. We must prevent more protectionist measures from being taken by both sides. We must guarantee that products are safe for our consumers. We must prevent anti-terrorism measures from obstructing all these activities as is currently under discussion. For these reasons, I would be happy if we could make real progress in our cooperation. Many of the issues which concern us in other areas of the world, such as wage, social and environmental dumping, are not problems in the transatlantic relationship.
(FR) Madam President, the election of President Obama has rightly been welcomed as a victory for US democracy. However, the recent Nobel Peace Prize that has just been awarded to him places him under pressure. Peace in the Middle East? It is something we hope for, but he is certainly not the master card. Peace in Afghanistan? There, US strategy has freedom of manoeuvre, but if President Obama listens to his hawks, he risks another Vietnam. It is a telling sign that the book by Gordon Goldstein describing the dramatic spiral towards failure in the war in Vietnam has been flying off the shelves in Washington, and there are no copies left in the shops.
The President must now choose between two strategies: one focuses on stabilisation, the eradication of poverty and the economic development of Afghanistan, by providing a military as well as a civilian presence throughout the country. The second aims to concentrate on a few urban areas and from there to launch large-scale operations against Al-Qaida. Both options require the despatch of troops, but the first is oriented towards the people, and the second towards the war with, in the background, the risk of a catastrophe.
(FR) Madam President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation between Europe and the United States is crucial in resolving most of the major crises in the world, and the new US administration certainly provides an opportunity. It has already taken some initiatives that have marked a break with the past: in Iraq, on Guantánamo, on the anti-missile shield. It would be naïve, however, to think that that will be enough to make US and European points of view identical in all situations, and that transatlantic relations will now be very simple.
Whether on preparations for Copenhagen or aid to developing countries, on Doha and protectionism, on financial regulation and combating tax havens, on the relaunch of the peace process in the Middle East or a firm policy on the nuclear issue in Iran, the US is extremely unwilling to take action. This goes beyond the issue of whether or not the administration has good intentions, and often relates to the influence of lobby groups on Congress, or simply the defence of its interests by a great power which is being shaken by the new world order.
This affair of barriers to trade is being tackled as if the problems were only of a technical nature. Naturally, economic and commercial trade between the United States and Europe is important for jobs and for businesses. It ought to be developed. First of all, however, trade is not really in danger. Secondly, when there is a conflict, either it relates to defending our economic interests - for example, as in Airbus - or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules - in the case of beef containing hormones, for instance, or chlorinated chicken - and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model, our social model, our environmental model, or development model, as if economic relations were an end in themselves. We must be able to combine the two, and we should not surrender our political autonomy in search of a partnership that is, in itself, a commendable objective.
Finally, let me just say, on the transatlantic legislators' dialogue, that Congress and Parliament need to step up their game in this area. We do not want to follow the Administration and the Commission, as most people in this House would agree. We want to be amongst the leaders for change. We need to be the impetus for this change. TEC needs our support, but the TLD needs to be at the heart of the discussion - not just on the side and not just as advisers, but very much part of the central aspect of this whole transatlantic relationship.
(PL) Madam President, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor. I think it is very important that we are discussing transatlantic relations, because we find ourselves, in part, in a paradoxical situation. The changes which have taken place in the United States have largely been very well received in Europe. On the other hand, however, the United States is showing greater interest in other important countries and continents than it did in the past. In particular, a revival of contacts between the United States and China has been observed, as have efforts to improve relations with Russia.
(HU) I read the following in a European Union White Paper in 1996: a fierce global battle is expected in the coming decades between Europe, the United States, Japan and the emerging Asian countries. Fortunately, this battle is taking place not with weapons, but mainly in the economic sector. Europe must hold its own in this. President Giscard d'Estaing, who was Chairman of the Convent, the leader of a government drafting a failed constitution, said that Europe must not be the United States' rival, but a reliable partner. This is a key issue in the EU-US Summit's success. We must strive for partnership, but if our only consideration is for the United States to regard us as a partner, and we do not get involved in conflicts on behalf of Europe's population, we cannot achieve success in important matters.
Madam President, I would like to thank all of the honourable Members for their contributions to this debate. There is a high level of consensus on the importance of deepening our cooperation with the American administration and the summit that we are about to hold. I am very pleased that the American administration is showing such a desire to deepen and develop our relations. I think that we have done our homework and we are very well prepared to take some important steps. We have a number of problems in common with our partner, the US, and it is therefore appropriate to find common solutions.
As a transitional phase, we need to find an agreement that can apply for a short period until we have the new Treaty of Lisbon in place. Experts have looked into this, including the French judge, Jean-Louis Bruguyère, who was asked by the EU to inspect the TFTP. Bruguyère found that the legal certainty requirements and the protection of personal data in the current agreement are adequate. In the more permanent agreement and once the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, there will eventually be opportunities for the European Parliament to take an active part in shaping this.
The meeting that we are to have next week is a very important one, but it is nevertheless just a meeting. I believe that we can make progress, resolve some issues and get some important processes off the ground relating to those matters that we have in common and need to resolve in a close and strategic partnership with the American administration. I am very pleased about the strong support in the European Parliament for the efforts of the Council and the Commission. I will, of course, report to you the results next time we meet in the plenary sitting in Brussels.
With regard to the TEC, this is a very important new mechanism, or re-energised mechanism, to work on all matters regarding the free market and market barriers. We want to eliminate these, which is the ultimate objective of the TEC. This was clearly stated in the TEC framework agreement of 30 April 2007. Of course, I am aware of the different ideas that have been raised recently - such as reaching a unified transatlantic market by 2015 through the elimination of existing obstacles to economic integration: the so-called Millán Mon report. We no doubt need to work on the right balance between ambition and realism, which is why we are working on medium-term priority tasks for the TEC.
in writing. - As the Lisbon Treaty is about to enter into force, the rapid progress in the transatlantic relationship between the two biggest democratic and economic entities will have an increased importance. Both the EU and the US continue to be key actors in international trade and providers of stability. The European Parliament has been a leading force in advancing transatlantic cooperation, having proposed in its resolutions the creation of a transatlantic free market, as well as establishing new structures for closer political and interparliamentary relations. The Transatlantic Economic Council has done good work so far. I hope that in the near future, we shall be able to work out solutions to overcome the regulatory barriers between the EU and the US. The role of legislators in this relationship will be important. Members of the European Parliament are willing and ready to fully contribute to TEC processes.
in writing. - Relations between the US and the European Union have always been strong. It was with American aid that a shattered Europe was able to reconstruct and develop in the post war years. Now the world again faces a crisis and it is more vital than ever that we retain this link and work together to resolve the problems which have beset the world economy. The European Union and the United States have a strategic role to play in the recovery process. Combined, our gross domestic product represents more than half the world's GDP, and we have the worlds strongest bilateral trade partnership, making up almost 40% of world trade. However, further developments must be implemented if we are to combat the economic crisis effectively. The Transatlantic Economic Council has created for itself the goal of an integrated Trans-Atlantic market by 2015. This will be done by reducing barriers to trade. If this goal is accomplished, economic growth can re-commence and the recovery process can begin. The risk of a further 'Credit Crunch' is not over. To avoid further economic collapse and unemployment, the EC must ensure coordinated economic policies are put in place in both areas.
It goes without saying that the economic relationship between the US and the EU must be maintained. However, we must not, under any circumstances, allow the US to monopolise Europe in economic terms. On the contrary, we must learn from the economic crisis, which had its origins in the unsupervised financial markets in the US. Europe must maintain its economic independence and find its own way out of the crisis, particularly as bonuses amounting to billions of dollars are being paid out on the New York stock exchange as we speak. Therefore, I am calling for the European position on the Transatlantic Economic Council to be strengthened. At the EU-US Summit in Prague in April 2009, President Obama pressed the European Union to offer Turkey full membership in the near future, claiming that the EU would be contributing to better understanding with the Islamic world. The fact that the US is supporting its strategic NATO ally (so that Turkey would clear the way for Rasmussen to become Secretary General of NATO) should not result in the negotiations on full membership being accelerated. Despite American support, Turkey will not become a suitable candidate for accession, because there is no sign of huge cultural, geographical, economic and political differences being reduced. The EU should take a clear position with regard to the US on this issue.
In the light of the economic crisis and the preparations for the climate conference in Copenhagen, it is important for us to take the opportunity of the Transatlantic Economic Council meeting to strengthen further the relationship between the EU and the US. In the area of the environment, we must discuss new types of foods in particular. The opportunities and perspectives of nanotechnologies are also a relevant subject. We should definitely hold open discussions on the topics of genetic engineering and animal cloning. Europe should not be afraid to explain clearly to its trading partner the concerns of some Member States. In the area of chemicals and toxic substances, we must work towards high standards of protection and better coordination. This will not only make trade and economic relationships easier, but will also guarantee in particular that consumers in Europe are protected against toxic substances in the environment and in the products they use. Constructive discussions will help to ensure that the special relationship between the EU and the US is maintained.
It is high time that the appeals by Parliament, the efforts of the Commission and the endeavours of the visa-discriminated Member States produced results. Otherwise, it will be necessary to take radical action and introduce a visa requirement for American citizens. It is time, at last, to bring an end to this one-sided privilege enjoyed by the United States. The European Parliament must not tolerate American discrimination of European citizens on the grounds of their nationality. The position of Parliament in this matter is all the more significant because not all the governments of the Member States understand the necessity of applying the principle of visa reciprocity. One of these is the government of the Republic of Poland. The position of the citizens is completely different. Over 61% of Poles are in favour of the introduction of entry visas for citizens of the United States. In an Internet poll, the number of respondents declaring themselves in favour of such a measure was as high as 96%.
The problem is not new. In fact, the question comes up every year in connection with the flu season. Generally speaking, new seasonal flu viruses first appear in developing countries. From then on, laboratories in the industrialised countries start producing a new vaccine. They can only begin production if they have previously obtained strains from the country - generally a developing country - where the new type of flu first emerged. Once developed, the vaccine is only just enough to protect the populations of the industrialised countries. The result is that the populations of the South are unprotected against pandemics.
I am addressing the Commission in order to ask it what it intends to do to end this injustice. Is it morally defensible to have the level of health protection available to a population depend on the financial resources its country has? I would therefore like to know whether the Commission can tell us what resources it is able to mobilise to fill this gap. What, if need be, would be the Commission's strategy, and what partnerships would it establish with the states concerned and with the institutions of the United Nations' system, or with the private sector, in the effort to enable citizens in developing countries to have access to the vaccine?
We talk about effectiveness in terms of the rapid alert systems, the close monitoring of the development of the pandemic and actual virus itself, as well as the assessment of the effectiveness of the preventive and curative measures adopted in the countries where the pandemic first occurred, which are all vital elements in preparing and adapting our own responses. However, we also talk about solidarity because the Europe Union, as a main financer of public development aid and a key partner of a large number of developing countries, must support these countries in facing these new threats.
In our response to these threats, the Commission and the European Union as a whole are not starting their efforts from scratch. Based on the precedent of bird flu, resulting from the H5N1 virus, the EU has been able to introduce, along with international organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the World Bank and others, effective procedures for exchanging information and coordinating technical assistance, as well as financial instruments such as a trust fund at the World Bank. As Mrs Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organisation, says, the world has never been so well prepared for a pandemic. The Commission has already played and continues to play a particularly important role in these systems whose components have now been extended to cover every type of flu threat.
This week in Geneva, the WHO is presenting its first recommendations from the group in which the Community has played an active role. In accordance with the World Assembly's resolution, the final recommendations must be presented to the WHO's Executive Council, which will meet at the end of January. At that juncture, the best possible balance must be identified between, on the one hand, boosting the research into and rapid development of new medical products largely derived from private sector research, for which intellectual property rights nowadays provide a key form of incentive, and, on the other hand, fairness in terms of providing access to the products developed from this research.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the inevitable arrival and recurrence of a flu pandemic has thrust the issue of vaccination to the forefront of the news agenda. However, this has been a long-standing and persistent problem for the developing world. The oral question this morning raises an excellent point about the hypocrisy and inequity of the Western world demanding materials for vaccines from developing countries to protect their rich citizens, and then having the audacity to sell the selfsame vaccines back to the poor.
Above and beyond the need for the developing world to have similar access to flu vaccinations, we must strive to set up a system whereby the poorest people of the world, who are almost invariably more exposed to disease, have the opportunity which we in the West take for granted to protect themselves from preventable diseases. Tuberculosis is a good example of the contrast between us and our neighbours in the developing world. In Europe, children are routinely given the BCG vaccination, which has greater than 80% effectiveness. This has led to a situation in Europe where TB is not the persistent threat is once was.
Contrast this with the developing world, where 26% of avoidable deaths are caused by tuberculosis. The effect of TB in these countries is exacerbated by the fact that it is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads easily within confined spaces such as the squalid shanty towns so prevalent in many developing nations. Add to this the fact that 50% of AIDS patients in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV/AIDS is rife will develop TB, and we can see how lucky we are to be in the relatively controlled immunised area, having programmes such as we do.
(ES) Mr Mitchell, with respect to the issue of lifts, which you have raised, I would like to reveal something which may be a secret part of the Bureau's debates. At the most recent Bureau meeting, I criticised the situation you have just described and which, shamefully, is not merely a problem in Strasbourg. In Brussels, too, there have been weeks during which it really was impossible to move around the various labyrinthine Parliament buildings, because the lifts were out of order.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I would like to bring the House away from lifts and back to vaccines which prevent deaths. I think that is exactly what we should be focusing on. Of course I support the call that we have heard relating to the A (H1N1) virus but I want to look much wider: in fact, Commissioner, there are systems that work, and vaccines do work. Look at pneumococcal disease. It is a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, and is relatively unknown despite its deadly status as the leading vaccine-preventable killer of children under five worldwide.
I would remind the House that expanded access to essential vaccines is a key lever to achieving Millennium Development Goal 4: a two-thirds reduction in child mortality by 2015. We must make sure that we put these vaccines in the hands of countries that need them most. It is a simple step that will quite simply save millions of children's lives. There is before this House a written declaration on this matter, including the pooling of patents. I urge Members to sign this and do something that matters.
I am not saying that the solution is simple, especially - not only, but especially - because the question of access to the vaccine is in no way comparable to that of access to medicines, for at least two specific reasons: the small number of producers and control of the refrigeration chain, which is still difficult. There are positive elements, however: the fact that, for the time being, the virus is not mutating and the announced availability of three billion doses each year. These are obvious facts and they demand, they encourage the launching of a strategy on a worldwide scale.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to stress the importance of the question that was asked by Mr Goerens, which is a matter of basic justice. We are all perfectly aware that, in an influenza A pandemic situation, it would be southern countries that bear the brunt of this problem and the consequences of the spread of the virus, and not northern countries. Every year, we sit idly by as thousands of citizens die as a result of pandemics that have already been eradicated or are treatable in northern countries, and there is a very long list: malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, tuberculosis. The list is endless, yet we watch and do nothing about this problem.
Do we actually want to treat this problem as a public health problem or as a business? If we want to treat it as a public health problem, then we have to ensure equal access to treatment in all regions of the world and we therefore have to be more effective in our efforts. That being said, I would like to ask, and I hope that it is not the case, if we are waiting for there finally to be surplus stocks of vaccines in Europe or for the side effects to prove too harmful before we show our generosity and suddenly start sending the necessary vaccines to southern countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, the war has left a profound impression on Georgians and the country is still facing fundamental problems, such as meeting the basic needs of thousands of displaced persons. As a result, I am pleased to say that the implementation of the package of post-conflict assistance prepared by the European Commission with support from Member States and other parties is working well. As you are aware, the European Commission's package provides assistance of up to EUR 500 million for the 2008-2010 period. Some of the areas which the package focuses on include the needs of displaced persons inside the country and on economic measures aimed at generating economic growth and stimulating job creation. In addition, the European Commission has proposed that Georgia should benefit from macrofinancial assistance amounting to EUR 46 million to help this country overcome the impact of the financial and economic crisis.
At the moment, the working party for displaced persons inside the country and humanitarian aspects, co-chaired by the European Commission and UNHCR, is discussing a set of measures intended to be accepted for returning refugees and displaced persons within the country and other displaced persons. At the same time, in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two mechanisms for preventing and responding to incidents are yielding some positive results in terms of reducing the number of incidents and facilitating the crossing of the borders by these persons.
Taking into account the events of the recent past, it is important to reinforce stability, security and prosperity in Georgia. The need for economic and political reforms in this country is greater than ever. The Eastern Partnership, launched in Prague in May, is an important framework for strengthening the support we give Georgia, both bilaterally and through multilateral cooperation with other partners in the region. One key element is the proposal to establish stronger political and commercial relations. According to the Eastern Partnership, the External Relations Council agreed in September that the directives on negotiating new agreements must be prepared for all three countries in the Southern Caucasus, including Georgia.
Apart from strengthening our political relations, we will propose that the new agreement with Georgia should include the creation of an expanded, comprehensive free trade area. It is important to mention that such an area would ensure the gradual alignment of Georgia's economy with the EU internal market. It goes without saying that this ambitious long-term objective will still require Georgia to make and support efforts aimed at implementing reforms. Negotiations on an expanded, comprehensive free trade area will only start after the necessary conditions have been fulfilled.
Thirdly, the hostilities in South Ossetia have proven that there is no such thing as a frozen conflict. The term frozen has a notion of appeasement. A lack of interest on the part of the international community may lead to chronicity and an unsettled conflict is a potential threat to peace and stability. One year after the conflict, I underline once more the successful role of the European Union and the French Presidency in achieving a speedy ceasefire and the mission which monitors it. The presence of European monitors is a guarantee that no side can claim from now on arbitrarily that the other has started hostilities. Efforts now should be diverted towards a political settlement, however difficult this is, and the political negotiations launched in Geneva immediately after the hostilities should be encouraged to continue.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Commission, we welcome the impartial and independent investigation of, and the subsequent report on, the 2008 conflict in Georgia, conducted by the International Fact-Finding Mission headed by the Swiss diplomat, Heidi Tagliavini. Before the outbreak of hostilities in South Ossetia on the night of 7 to 8 August 2008, which claimed many civilian lives, we had been witnesses to months of provocation from all sides. The Russian military intervention, including its invasion of Georgia, was disproportionate and unjustified. Both sides to the conflict were guilty of breaches of international humanitarian law, which has also been confirmed by the report and by various organisations, such as Human Rights Watch.
What are we to do now? Russia must fully honour the peace accord. First of all, it must withdraw from the areas it has occupied since 7 August 2008. It should provide immediate, free and unlimited access to South Ossetia to members of the EU Monitoring Mission and international agencies, including the UN, so that they are able to supervise the ceasefire and deliver humanitarian aid. Approximately 25 - 30 000 Georgians remain displaced in South Ossetia and the de facto authorities of South Ossetia must facilitate their return to their homes.
Georgia's territorial integrity must remain beyond question. There are, however, worrying signs of authoritarianism in Georgia. The abuse of the legal system by President Saakashvili, the mounting hostility towards any opposing views, the steadily diminishing freedom of speech and the sometimes confrontational nationalist rhetoric are all to Georgia's detriment. Georgia will only be able to return to the pro-European and democratic path and become attractive to other countries in the region if it upholds the ideals it embraced during the Rose Revolution. All actors should avail themselves bona fide of the opportunities presented by the Geneva negotiations. The situation in the Caucasus must be given serious attention at the next EU-Russia Summit.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I have the opportunity to convey my approval to the rapporteur. The report has an extremely important role even if it only refutes the widespread myth - a myth spread by the Russian Federation - that Georgia started the war. At the same time, this report is balanced, and criticises both sides in the conflict, even saying that they could not prevent the conflict. The report is certainly significant because it very clearly states the fact that the Russian Federation - right from the start of the conflict - organised training on South Ossetian territory, and provided the South Ossetians with military technology and also other military equipment.
Another essential moment in this report is definitely the question of 'passportisation', which the Russian Federation has been implementing for many years, both in Abkhazia and in South Ossetia, and thus creating a conflict with international law, not to speak of the undermining of good neighbourly relations. Though the report says very clearly that this passportisation has not made the people living in South Ossetia or Abkhazia into citizens of the Russian Federation, only de jure are they still Georgian citizens and also because of this, the Russian Federation's claim that they were protecting or sending people to protect their citizens in South Ossetia definitely does not hold water. Another important part of the report is certainly the fact that it speaks of the ethnic cleansing on South Ossetian territory in the Georgian villages. This is a very important moment. Unfortunately, however, the report does not deal with the ethnic cleansing which the Russian Federation carried out in Abkhazia from 1991 when, because of Georgia's independence, almost a quarter of a million Georgians were forced to leave Abkhazia, their own country.
Also, finally, Madam President, I would like to say that the most important thing of all is, of course, the reference in the report to the fact that Georgia's independence, autonomy, sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. For us, the question today is can this really be done, and if we now, before long, are celebrating 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, then I would like to ask, ladies and gentlemen, when will we be able to celebrate the day when Abkhazia and South Ossetia are united with Georgia?
The report made it very clear that both sides were responsible for the escalation to the conflict that finally took place in August 2008. It is clear that Russia had been building up a military presence in South Ossetia, which was Georgian territory. However, it is also clear that those provocations led to an overreaction by Georgia's President Saakashvili. It is important to have said that both sides were responsible, and we now have to look at how things can develop in the future. That was the very big achievement of this report. I also agree very much with everybody who has said that the territorial integrity of Georgia, and of all countries, has to be respected. International law has to be respected.
In our discussions now - the member of the Commission has suggested moving to a free trade zone with Georgia, and Parliament will be discussing microfinancial assistance for Georgia - it is clear that the EU also has to consider placing conditions on Georgia, for example, to reduce the amount of its military budget. The defence budget has been building up over recent years in Georgia, which is then short in other areas, such as social issues, civil society and media freedom. The EU has to monitor that very closely. In brief, it is important that the EU supports efforts to tone down the aggressive language, and financial assistance has to come with conditions.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the ECR Group and on behalf of the delegation of the European Parliament for cooperation with the Parliament of Georgia, of which I am the chair, I welcome the report which the Commission has submitted. The report is credible and has not been questioned by any of the parties to the conflict. We are monitoring the situation in Georgia closely and we are also monitoring details of the preparations for Georgia's membership in NATO. We fully back the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia as an independent state. We cannot accept the idea that Georgia or any other country lies within the exclusive sphere of influence of the Russian Federation or of any other country. In connection with the military conflict which took place in Georgia a year ago, we are monitoring with great unease the situation in South Ossetia in particular. We are uneasy about the situation regarding adherence to ceasefire agreements and we are particularly uneasy about the situation of the refugees who were forced to leave their homes and who are unable to return. The EU's humanitarian assistance is unfortunately not getting through to Abkhazia and South Ossetia at the moment. Both ethnic Georgians and other inhabitants are suffering in these areas at present. It is also a matter of great regret to us that the independent peace observers sent to Georgia by the EU have not even been able to work in these areas.
The report states that both sides in the conflict violated international law. It is not our role to judge, but nonetheless it is clear from the report that the steps taken by the Russian Federation go far beyond the general concept of necessary defence. We are extremely concerned by the information on the ethnic cleansing and violence against civilian populations which took place both during and after the conflict, according to the report. In the future work of the inter-parliamentary committee, we will be supporting an immediate end to all violence, an immediate lifting of blockades preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to those who really need it, access for international peace observers and the greatest possible alleviation of the impact of the conflict on innocent civilians. We will support all steps that lead to an ending of the conflict and to a restoration of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia.
Of course there was, and is, a winner: Russia. With the help of the Georgian President, the Kremlin is completing, resolutely and by military means, the political annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The loser is the Georgian State although, incidentally, it can console itself with the support of the Russian Orthodox Church, which continues to assert that Abkhazians and South Ossetians are Georgian citizens. I should like to emphasise this commendable stance on the part of the Moscow Patriarchate, which I am sure is an example for wavering Member States to follow.
Due to what was unfortunately often one-sided reporting by the international media on the facts and background to the war, I should like to clarify a number of points: the US sharply condemned Russia's military action, describing it a demonstration of pure intimidation and power and defended Georgia's stance. The first thing that needs to said here is that Russia was not the aggressor and reacted to the war started by Saakashvili. He knew full well when he implemented his reunification programme that he was facing an all-powerful adversary, but he was counting on NATO and the US to cover his back, which is why he decided to wrest renegade provinces back by force.
Other main conclusions of the mission remain of global importance as well. They are: no more peacekeepers from a neighbouring country as they usually defend particular zones d'état but not peace. The impact of a great power's coercive politics and diplomacy against a small and unsubordinated neighbour should be considered, not to mention eventual loss of important parts of territory through creeping annexation. There are no winners in this conflict. When the international community is among the big losers, the political culture of cooperation has suffered.
(SL) Madam President, Commissioner, I had the opportunity of visiting Tbilisi myself in September last year. The question of Georgia's territorial integrity and stability has a strong bearing on the stability of the region at large, which unfortunately has a stable history of instability. There is no one truth, there are several truths and they often contradict each other. When decision-making politicians lose hold of their senses, the consequences are unpredictable and wide-ranging. Direct and collateral damage is huge, but the consequences will affect innocent people first and foremost.
Neither interference by the major powers nor support for this or that side can lead to success. We need action that will restore and strengthen confidence, which is currently non-existent. The Caucasus is a complex region and, like the Balkans, has more history than it is able to digest and cope with. Quick fixes and xenophobia will never be a path to success. However, while disrespect for the rights and legitimate freedoms of minorities is the main cause of conflict, the causes are wider than that and include those of an economic nature, primarily energy and geopolitics. However, geopolitics demands that the major powers act responsibly, because grass always grows sparsely where the elephants roll. We have to teach those elephants the lesson that not all the grass is, or will ever be, theirs.
(PL) Madam President, I believe that the present debate has fallen into the pattern of focusing mainly on curing the symptoms resulting from the grave situation in Georgia. Georgia is currently a country where the European Union's reputation as a major force on the international scene is being decided. The truth of the matter is that nobody has honoured Mr Sarkozy's plan, and it has already been consigned to the historical archives; that Russia is persisting in its military integration of Abkhazia and Ossetia; and that the European Union will not be able to build its status as a power whose word commands respect as far as the situation in Georgia is concerned. The best evidence of this is that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is absent from today's debate, and only Mr Orban is putting forward the Commission's position. Mrs Wallis evidently does not believe the matter is sufficiently important, judging by the strict limits she has imposed on the speaking time allowed for this question.
(HU) This is an issue that concerns the major powers, although it is a human rights situation. As pawns in the major powers' games, civilians, minorities and democracy are always the victims in this situation. Where there is separation and division, security is replaced by uncertainty and guns do the talking instead of having negotiations. What can be done? The European Union must show some credibility. The EU must adopt a minorities policy which guarantees minorities the right to use their mother tongue, promote their culture and enjoy autonomy in France, Romania, Greece and Slovakia as well. The key to the situation in Russia, Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia lies in the EU. The EU must come up with a solution and be able to set an example for these countries.
Madam President, there is one conclusion to draw from the conflict, which is that the international community has, for far too long and too readily, agreed to the existence of so-called frozen conflicts which, as my colleague, Mr Kasoulides, has put it, equals appeasement. The central fact of this conflict is that Georgia did not invade Russian territory, whereas Russia invaded Georgian territory with massive military force and was about to occupy its capital. It was an unprecedented breach of international law and undermines the credibility of Russia as a reliable partner.
I would like to start with some important information about the Sakharov Prize for 2009. This morning's Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2009 to Memorial, the organisation of Oleg Orlov, Sergey Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva and all other defenders of human rights in Russia whom it represents. We have awarded this year's prize to Memorial. We sincerely hope that by doing so, we will contribute to ending the circle of fear, uncertainty and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation.
Let me share with you my great satisfaction in being able to announce this prize as the President of the European Parliament and, in particular, as a man who comes from Solidarity. At one time, we had serious problems very similar to those that our colleagues and partners in the Russian Federation have today. I am very pleased that truth and freedom will always win in the end. This is how it was in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The fact that the Russians who are seeking the truth today are unable to go about their business freely is a major problem for the whole of Europe as well as a personal tragedy for themselves. The purpose of this prize is for us Members of the European Parliament to express our great support for their activities.
I would like to use this occasion to say that the two nominations that did not receive the Sakharov Prize this year do enjoy our great support, and that we should also mention their names as persons who have made a particularly strong impression on us. The fact that we mentioned their names, the fact that they were with us in so many debates, speaks a great deal of our great support for what they have done. It is not just the winner of the prize but also the nominees who deserve our great respect and deep recognition.
I therefore ask that Amendment 70, which proposes an appropriation of EUR 600 million to support the milk sector, which is facing an extremely serious situation, as we all know, be voted on immediately before Amendment 812, which proposes an appropriation of 300 million. I would point out that this appropriation of EUR 600 million was unanimously approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and won broadly majority support in this House, in the last sitting on 17 September, when we voted on a resolution on supporting the milk sector and the crisis it is facing.
Mr President, Guinea-Conakry needs the support of the international community. Following the death of President Conté, a military junta seized power. Criticised by the international community, it did, however, receive domestic support because it promised a rapid transition to a civil regime with free elections. Captain Dadis Camara, who led the junta, made a firm commitment not to stand in the presidential elections, but after a disastrous management of the country - no budget, no public tender bids, no basic services for the population - he acquired a taste for power and clung to it so tightly that he is now standing in the elections. His electoral campaign relies on all of the country's organisational, media and economic resources. In the face of this violation of the commitments formerly made by the junta, the opposition organised a demonstration, which was brutally repressed by the presidential guard. It left 150 dead and more than 1 000 injured, and many women were raped and disembowelled.
Mr President, when, at the end of last year, Captain Camara headed the military junta which took power in Guinea after the death of President Conté, the international community unfortunately held the naïve belief that Captain Camara would hold free and democratic presidential elections in which he would not take part. We now know that when, on 28 September, over 50 000 opposition supporters gathered in the national stadium to protest against Captain Camara's change of tack and broken promises, he sent the troops against them. Over 150 people died, over 1 200 were wounded, and there were numerous cases of rape.
I am pleased that Javier Solana, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Policy and Security, was so quick to speak out. I would like to thank the French Government for suspending military cooperation with Guinea. However, three weeks have passed since the massacre, and these actions have yielded no visible results. For this reason, I believe that the European Union should focus on exerting pressure on Guinea, together with the UN and the African Union, and to apply the severest possible sanctions. Only then will we be able to talk about the handover of power by Captain Camara.
I hope that this is the first step towards the European Union reviewing its trade policy with developing countries. We have a huge responsibility as one of the world's most important and largest players when it comes to trade and also development. There must be consistency between our trade and our relationship with this type of regime. Over the years, we have tried to improve the fisheries agreement by saying that some of the money from the agreement should go to supporting local fisheries. However, the Commission's own evaluations have shown that the money is not actually used for the purpose stated in the agreement, but instead goes directly to support this type of regime. The European Union must cease to provide this support.
Mr President, I will not repeat all of the intelligent and sensible things that have already been said by my fellow Members. I would firstly like to say that I am very pleased that this issue is being debated here today. I will briefly say a few words about the debate we had in the committee about the fisheries agreement on 30 September. In fact, when we debated this issue, you would have thought that the EU was in the process of entering into a trade agreement with any old Western democracy. Nowhere in the discussion or in the documents was it mentioned that the agreement in front of us was with a nation in which the situation is as it is today and which has already been described very well in this House.
Many people perhaps thought that fisheries and human rights are completely separate issues and that we should not mix the two together. Personally, I cannot understand how, as a politician, anyone could think in that way. The fact that the votes in the committee were 11 to 9 in favour of not concluding the agreement is also very worrying. This means that there was quite a large group in Parliament that, at least at that stage, thought that it was perfectly alright to enter into a trade agreement with a country like Guinea with the sort of regime that it has. I am pleased to say, firstly, that there is now a much higher level of agreement for us taking a clear line with regard to Guinea and, secondly, that there is broad support for the Council actually having withdrawn this agreement now. I am extremely pleased about this.
As representatives of democratic countries, we must demand the immediate withdrawal of the junta and that all responsible for the bloody massacre of civilians, shooting into crowds and the public raping of women be brought to justice. Guinea is a country with huge economic potential, yet in spite of this, it is one of the world's poorest countries and one of the most corrupt states in Africa, and further dictatorship by the military junta could lead to civil war and destabilise the situation in the whole of West Africa.
Mr President, I asked for the floor simply to make a comment on the suggestion to suspend the existing EU-Guinea fisheries protocol. I doubt whether a brutal regime which does not hesitate to dispense with the lives of 156 of its citizens and is responsible for so many other atrocities will be moved by such a disproportionately small sanction on that issue. We should also bear in mind that there are legal obligations regarding this agreement towards people employed in the fishing industry in Guinea who have nothing to do with the brutal regime. That is why the EPP is hesitant to support this suggestion.
Mr President, the story of Guinea-Conakry follows a depressingly familiar African script: a dictatorial ruler; a military coup; one authoritarian regime replaced by another; and most of the people still living in abject poverty. Substantial mineral and oil resources could make Guinea one of Africa's most prosperous nations. Instead, the wealth fuels conflict and misery, not only in Guinea, but throughout a region that has witnessed appalling bloodshed and chronic instability in the past 20 years.
In the past, I have pressed the European Commission to help develop a kind of Kimberley Process for resources other than just diamonds to ensure that the activities of mining companies do not support civil war or ruthless dictators such as Captain Camara in Guinea. I am therefore especially concerned about the massive deal struck between Guinea and Chinese companies, and I hope that the Commission and Council will express to Beijing our expectations that its business activities there should neither provoke internal strife nor further undermine human rights in Guinea. However, like Mr Kasoulides, I suspect the proposals to rescind the EU fisheries agreement will only serve to punish local communities, not the military junta.
Guinea is a signatory to the Cotonou Agreement, which requires human rights and democracy to be respected. This is a basic premise. We really must insist that a country's democratic development should get properly under way when we conclude more cooperation agreements on the basis of Cotonou. As we have heard, the situation in Guinea at this time is intolerable and calls for a swift response and possible sanctions. Guinea has important reserves of ore and, consequently, great opportunities for development. At the same time, it is one of the world's most corrupt countries. It is quite deplorable that Chinese state-owned companies and businesses that invest in Guinea do not insist on any sort of commitment to human rights.
Secondly, the Commission welcomes the decision of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to set up an international committee of inquiry to investigate the massacres of 28 September in order to bring to justice the perpetrators of these acts. It is vitally important for us to put an end to their impunity and to the deterioration in the human rights situation in Guinea. The international committee of inquiry and the preliminary investigations carried out by the International Criminal Court will help improve the situation in this respect.
Mr President, Iran is characterised by linguistic, religious, ethnic and political diversity. The Shia majority lives alongside Sunnis, Zoroastrians, Christians, Jews and Baha'i. The Persian majority shares the country with countless ethnic minorities that make up almost half of the population: Azeris, Arabs, Kurds, Baloch and others. The cities are teeming with a modern middle class and young people ready to live in 21st century Iran. All this commotion and complexity frightens the regime that would rather have a simple Iran: simple in terms of religious fanaticism, in isolation of the country and simple in terms of public opinion cowed by violent repression.
This resolution describes the systematic violation of human rights to which Iranians are subjected in their own country, including frequent application of the death penalty, even against children, the stoning of men and women, extensive limitations on freedom of expression and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities. With this resolution, Parliament is sending out two separate messages. The first is for the people of Iran: Europe sees in Iranians and, particularly in its young people, the hope for a future in which their country will embrace democracy and freedom and will take on an important role in the region, as it deserves. The second is for the Iranian regime: we are telling it that Iran will never fulfil its unquestionable potential as long as violence and obscurantism are the main features of a political regime that merely pays lip service to the values of justice and peace and continues to brutally oppress its people.
Current self-isolation is leading to destruction in Iran and has a toxic impact on neighbouring countries and on the rest of the world. We cannot stand by and watch minor offenders being hanged, people being raped and arbitrary violence wrought upon citizens by their own regime. We stand here to restate that there cannot and will not be impunity for those guilty of committing crimes against humanity, and we will continue to stand with the Iranian people as they exercise their right to free speech and peaceful protest for freedom and democracy.
The situation has deteriorated during the regime of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who began his presidency by repeatedly denying the Holocaust and the State of Israel's right to exist. Since 2005, the number of executions in Iran has quadrupled, and Iran is the only country in the world which executes minors guilty of crimes. The systematic use of torture in prisons and the use of medieval punishments, such as amputation and stoning, is well known, but the regime is in difficulty as shown by the tens of thousands of people who were brave enough to protest in the streets following the last elections.
The young woman, Neda Agha-Soltan, killed in the street as she was standing up for her rights as a woman and as a citizen, has become the symbol not only of the repression, but also of the desire for freedom of a people that Europe must help. How can we help? One way is with the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Another tangible proposal is to name streets or squares in our cities after Neda Agha-Soltan. This would not only commemorate her sacrifice, but would show our solidarity with Iranian opposition and provide greater information and awareness of such a serious situation among European citizens. I would like to see a picture of Neda Agha-Soltan next to the picture of Aung San Suu Kyi displayed on one side of the European Parliament building in Brussels.
But we follow a policy of appeasement in the EU. Only this week, we have agreed that we will encourage the Russians to enrich the nuclear fuel rods, on behalf of Ahmadinejad, in return for his guarantee that he will stop his own nuclear enrichment programme. But he has not given that guarantee, nor has he given open access for inspectors to look at his nuclear facilities. We are only bolstering the Mullahs when we continue this policy of appeasement. We need to take tough sanctions. Toughness is the only language these Mullahs understand.
The fact that minors were still being executed in Iran at the time of the offence has also been addressed. Iran is the only country which was still executing minors at the time of the offence. Iran has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and is therefore obliged to pass a national law prohibiting the execution of minors. A bill has been tabled before the Iranian Parliament and we must call on our colleagues there to do everything they can so that the passage of this bill stops being blocked. I consider this a very important task.
Mr President, on 2 October this year, the Iranian police stopped a man from boarding an aircraft at the last minute. The lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, was due to receive the International Human Rights Award for 2009 in my home town of Nuremburg for his courageous work on behalf of victims of political persecution. Despite having a valid passport, the Iranian powers refused to allow Mr Soltani to leave the country for no legal reason. His wife was allowed to leave. She rightly stated, and I quote: 'It pains me that in a country that calls itself a theocracy, acts are committed that have nothing to do with God'.
The Iraqi Government should stop following the orders of the Mullahs in Tehran. Iraq should understand that the Iranian regime has no future and is holding on to power for repression and executions. So, if Iraq is a sovereign country, they should respect and implement the European Parliament resolution of 24 April 2009 on Ashraf, which calls on Iraq to stop any forcible displacement of Ashraf residents within Iraq. The Mullahs in Tehran want Ashraf to be destroyed, and we in Europe must support these defenceless Iranian refugees. It is our moral duty.
When national interests - particularly of an economic nature - come into play, the Iranian pragmatists will appear of their own accord. In doing so, they can even make reference to the late Ayatollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. When it came down to it, he, too, opted resolutely to put the national interest before religious requirements. Commission, Council, I urge you to seek out the ayatollahs' weaknesses, primarily in the interests of a more tolerable fabric of life for the Iranian people and in the interests of the security of the Jewish State of Israel, not forgetting the Arab world, and also the European Union.
(HU) A few days ago, President Barroso was here and I asked him what could be done to resolve the human rights crisis that had been going on in a European Union Member State, Hungary, since autumn 2006. I mentioned on several occasions that many hundreds of people were subjected to such heavy-handed police brutality that they suffered serious injuries, while several hundred people were put arbitrarily under arrest and several hundred people went through lengthy criminal proceedings where they were proved innocent. The President replied to this that these were internal matters and the European Union cannot interfere in internal matters. I would like to ask about the double standard that is being applied and about what legal basis the European Union has for interfering in a country outside the European Union when it is reluctant to protect human rights in a European Union Member State. I would also like to take the opportunity to ask our Iranian friends, those belonging to the opposition and even those belonging to the government party, to help Hungarians protect their human rights.
(FI) Mr President, Iran would have an important role in the Middle East peace negotiations but, to our regret, the country seems to be slipping ever further away from the democratic rule of law. Firstly, there is reason to cast serious doubts on the election results last June that allowed President Ahmadinejad to remain in office. Since the elections, the general human rights situation has become even worse. Furthermore, since Ahmadinejad's rise to power in 2005, the number of executions that have taken place has quadrupled, and Iran executes the most people in the world after China. Secondly, freedom of religion and opinion are in a sorry state. For example, the seven Baha'i leaders are still imprisoned only on the basis of their religious convictions.
Mr President, I fully agree with the comments of Mr Czarnecki. The attack last July on the Iraqi PMOI camp at Ashraf in Iraq can only be described as savage and barbaric. Eleven people killed, and a lot more could have been killed; numerous people brutally injured - you have to see the video to realise the barbarity which actually occurred. The army and the military indulged themselves in the most sadistic form of brutality. As a result, 36 people were arrested; they had no option but to go on hunger strike. They were released two weeks ago because of international pressure - and international pressure after 72 days on hunger strike: that is what brought people to heel in relation to the Malaki government. So these people are refugees; they are entitled to go to bed at night and get up in the morning, safe. We need, as Mr Czarnecki said, two things: first of all, we need a permanent UN presence there to replace the United States and, secondly, an absolute guarantee of no displacement.
Large numbers of people have been executed by hanging in Iran just in the last few weeks. One of these people, whom you have already mentioned, Behnoud Shojaee, who was a minor at the time he committed his crime, was executed in spite of repeated appeals from the EU to have his sentence commuted. More minors are likely to be executed shortly in Iran. We are also concerned about the situation of seven Baha'i leaders in Iran, who have been under arrest for over 17 months and must answer serious accusations, such as espionage and anti-state propaganda. The latest scheduled hearing was postponed again on 18 October, leaving these seven people since then without any clear prospect of proper judicial proceedings.
I finally wish to emphasise that we share the concerns expressed by honourable Members about the state of human rights in Iran. The Commission is monitoring closely how the situation evolves and will continue to use every opportunity to call on the Iranian authorities to observe their international human rights commitments, including compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Improving the human rights situation in Iran is a key element in the European Commission's approach to strengthening political dialogue and cooperation with Tehran in the future.
For this reason, the European Commission must set up a delegation of the European Union in Tehran as soon as possible to support and reinforce dialogue with Iranian leaders and civil society, especially to give support to young people, political prisoners and journalists. The European Commission must become much more involved in the sending of a special envoy by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to monitor the situation as regards political prisoners and to ensure that the Iranian authorities observe international procedural standards and legal obligations with regard to human rights.
author. - Mr President, I support this resolution even though I think it is not critical enough of the Sri Lankan Government. Earlier this year, we witnessed the appalling military assault on the area held by the Tamil Tigers, without any regard for the lives or well-being of citizens who, in my view, are used as pawns by all sides, resulting in 90 000 dead. The world stood horrified and helpless, yet still today, there are more than a quarter of a million Sri Lankan citizens who are interned without adequate medical facilities, without clean water, sanitation or living space.
The people are suffering not only from the effects of the civil war, but also from the consequences of the tsunami and other natural disasters. The EU has stepped up foreign trade and is granting higher tariff preferences than to any other country in southeast Asia. International aid brings with it the obligation for the political forces in Sri Lanka to implement human rights. Two hundred and fifty thousand people are being held in overcrowded camps with poor drinking water and medical supplies. The aid organisations are being refused access. It should be in the government's own interest to organise the return to home villages as quickly as possible. The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is lobbying for the International Red Cross to be given a key role.
Another sector in which change is needed is freedom of the press and freedom of expression. The abduction and arrest of journalists must end. Critical articles should stop being punished with prison sentences. As a member of the SAARC delegation, I have been able to visit Sri Lanka many times. I believe a new beginning for this country will be rich in opportunity if the Tamil leaders are included in a constructive manner. However, this means rejecting all forms of terrorism and violence and it means cooperation on a strategy to implement human rights. I wish, for the sake of the citizens of Sri Lanka, that an expression which I have heard time and again - 'war is an institution' - will finally be consigned to the past.
The Rajapaksa Government is, in fact, a dictatorship with a very thin democratic veneer. I welcome the opportunity through this resolution to condemn it. I do have a reservation about paragraph 4 because the main terrorism, in fact, has come from the Rajapaksa Government against the people. While, as a Socialist, I believe that guerrillaism under the conditions in Sri Lanka will not bring a solution, the Tamil people do have a right to defend themselves against military repression.
The best way to defend the Tamil people is through a united struggle of Tamil and Sinhala workers and poor against the current government and its new liberal policies, and through the socialist transformation of Sri Lankan society, under which the marvellous resources of that country could be used for the benefit of the entire population. I am proud to be associated with the United Socialist Party in Sri Lanka, which is a sister party of the Socialist Party in Ireland, and which has heroically stood up against the chauvinism of the government for the rights of the Tamil and Sinhala people and the rights of the Tamil people to self-determination.
In July, the Sri Lankan Government was holding more than 280 000 people in 30 camps guarded by the army in the north-east of the island. The refugees can only leave the camps in order to receive emergency medical treatment, with a military escort accompanying them in most cases. In some camps, more than 1 000 people are dying every week, mainly of dysentery. The living conditions are appalling. President Rajapaksa declared last week that only 100 000 Tamil refugees would be released.
Mr President, I am very pleased as an Irish MEP that my colleagues from Ireland, Joe Higgins and Proinsias De Rossa, have outlined various concerns in Sri Lanka and Iran, and I concur with them. It is appropriate that Ireland should be concerned about these issues because it saw discrimination and loss of life in Northern Ireland for many years. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, the only solution comes through diplomacy and discussion. For that reason, I would hope that when the Lisbon Treaty is enacted, the new powers and the status which the President and the High Representative have will be utilised to bring, hopefully, common sense and good understanding to these places so that they will mend their ways and commit to the diplomatic and democratic way of life.
(FI) Mr President, we have followed and commented on the situation in Sri Lanka on a number of occasions and sometimes almost abandoned hope of finding a solution. Nevertheless, the conflict, which lasted 25 years, ended in the defeat of the Tamil Tigers this year. The lengthy conflict typically claimed a lot of victims and gave rise to internal refugees in the country, as well as causing problems for the economy and developments in the rule of law. Now the country has entered a hopeful, though critical, phase.
(SL) I am very much in favour of keeping the agenda unchanged. I was a member of the delegation of the European People's Party that travelled to Honduras and had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the situation there. There is no truth in the idea that the 29 November elections are taking place because of the events in June. The elections were called six months prior to those events and have no particular connection to subsequent political developments, nor could those developments have contributed to the emergence of any new candidates. I also think that the 29 November elections are part of the solution, not part of the problem. Everything suggests that we should keep the agenda as it is and that we should support the democratic development of this country in the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would say to all of you who have the same problem: thank you, but please do not take the floor. We can record the wishes of each one of you, but those wishes cannot be taken into account for the purposes of the vote or of the vote count. They are only taken into account in the minutes but not for the purposes of the vote count. I am sorry but you should always carry your voting paper with you because the vote can take place at any time.
Last week's meeting was also about the economic and financial situation. Although there are signs of improvement in the world economy, the European Council stressed that there is no room for complacency. Next year, all but one of the Member States risk exceeding the 3% deficit ceiling, and our collective GDP has shrunk by 4.7% since the beginning of 2008. Both of these are strong reasons why we should not withdraw supporting measures until we have secured our recovery. In the meantime, we need to reinforce confidence and continue work on our exit strategies.
With this agreement in place, President Václav Klaus was prepared to sign the treaty, and - as you all noted - he finally did so a week ago. The final instrument of ratification is now being deposited by the Czech Republic with the Italian authorities. This means that the Lisbon Treaty will enter into force on 1 December. I know that the vast majority of you here today share my satisfaction and relief that finally, this long chapter of preparations for institutional reform is coming to an end.
When I was in Washington and New Delhi last week, I was reminded just how far these two partners have come in the past year or so. The same is true of others, like China. Of course, we will continue to respect the important requirement of common but differential responsibility for climate change but, as I have said many times recently, we are all in this together, and we in the European Union will continue to push for real contributions from all the other players. We need to keep focused on the end goal - ambitious, serious, verifiable cuts in emissions to ensure that we keep within our target of limiting temperature increase to less than 2 °C.
So what are the prospects for Copenhagen? It now seems to be likely that Copenhagen will not see agreement to the fully-fledged treaty that we have pushed for and will continue to push for. But that is not a reason to accept anything less than a decisive breakthrough in these negotiations. In the end, it is content that matters more than form. In my view, we should try to arrive at a fully operational agreement, based on real political commitments, that comes rapidly into force, and which brings all the major players on board for both emission reductions and finance. And we should continue to fight on for final agreement to a treaty - a binding treaty. To make that happen, we need to join all our forces in the weeks remaining to Copenhagen.
We have just shown that we can, by decisive joint action, agree on a treaty that has proven elusive for a very long time. That was the other major result of the European Council: it lifted the last political hurdle to the final ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. Now we can look forward with confidence because, as Prime Minister Reinfeldt said, the Lisbon Treaty will be in place at the start of next month. In fact, the Commission is working on its implementation. Today, the Commission has launched a consultation on the Citizens' Initiative as a first, concrete step.
It is not for me to comment on the candidates for the Presidency of the European Council but, as Commission President and looking at the institutional matters, I very much hope that Heads of State or Government will select the personality that can provide effective leadership to the European Council - a President with a strong European commitment that can give consistency over time to European Council activity, both internally, so that priorities can be set over a longer timeframe and not just for six months, and externally, so that on common foreign and security policy, we send coherent messages to our international partners.
I am committed to working in tandem with this President of the European Council because that partnership will make all the difference. We need to pull together at the level of Heads of State or Government the common foreign and security policy on which the President of the European Council will represent the European Union at this level. We also have to put together all Community competences - from the economy to trade, from enlargement to development, from energy to justice - where the European Commission President represents the European Union according to the treaty. I am committed to making this partnership work in the interests of a strong and effective European Union at home and globally.
That is obviously also true for the High Representative. Here, I confess to a particular interest because that High Representative will also be one of the European Commission Vice-Presidents. On a very pragmatic level, because the nomination of the Vice-President/High Representative, and the other proposals by Member States for the Commission, will allow me to pass to the phase of finalising the next College and attributing portfolios. On a political level, because I am convinced that this High Representative/Vice-President, supported by a strong External Action Service bringing together European expertise in intergovernmental diplomacy with our Community competences, can mean a real step change in the effectiveness of our external action.
Everyone knows, in this House, the difficulties involved in the task, the difficult balance that you have to find between the political tendency, geographical origin, concern for equality and receptiveness of the candidates. However, it is your duty to finalise an agreement at the Council as quickly as possible, just as it is the duty of Parliament and of the parliamentary groups to give their verdict on these decisions responsibly and in accordance with the European general interest. Once again, I hope that this will be one of the success stories of the Swedish Presidency, but for this to be the case, we must act fast, very fast.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, perhaps it is a coincidence - although a happy coincidence - that this debate is being held immediately after the speech by Václav Havel, a man who has reminded us how important this process was twenty years ago. I was born just a few kilometres west of the Iron Curtain, but it could just as easily have been the other way round. At that time, I was in the Soviet occupation zone and I saw the Hungarian refugees of 1956, the refugees from the Prague Spring in 1968, such as my fellow Member, Libor Rouček. I see in the Treaty of Lisbon an extension of this process that is bringing Europe together.
We now need to take decisions with regard to people. I do not envy you this task, Mr Reinfeldt. However, I do have a request or a question for you: are you prepared, in your talks with the Heads of State or Government in the next few days, to ensure that in this Europe, we also attain something close to a geographical balance that is representative of the new Europe? Are you also prepared to ensure a stronger representation of women, perhaps? I am not just saying this on account of Mrs Malmström and Mrs Wallström, who are sitting here. Can Europe today afford to have top positions - and I am speaking to my own group too - in which so few women are represented? Is that the image that represents Europe to its people today? The President of Parliament has already mentioned this. You are not, of course, to blame if this does not happen, but I ask you, at least during the talks, to point out that we need a better geographical and, above all, a better gender balance in Europe in order to show that we represent the whole of the European population.
You mentioned the High Representative. Are you prepared, Mr Reinfeldt, to also ensure that it is made clear that, when you nominate a High Representative, he or she will not assume full duties until ratification has taken place or there is a decision of this Parliament? I know that there will, of course, be a gap in time, but it must be clear that, in his or her joint role as Vice-President of the Commission, the High Representative requires approval by Parliament. We will need to be very careful and conscientious in giving that approval. We need to make it clear that, particularly in this area, we will perform our duty and, Mr Barroso - I believe we can promise you this - although we want to carry out these hearings properly and carefully, we also want to reach our decisions as quickly as possible, as the citizens of Europe demand that we work and come to decisions quickly rather than spending months discussing various people.
There is also the debate about the financial transactions tax. I know that it has already been assigned to others five times, but it is probably also an important debate to show that we are serious about the control but not because we now want high tax burdens. However, we need to make it clear that we want to use all of the instruments to help to stem speculation and that, above all and in order to prevent a new crisis, resources are available to help those banks that, in spite of this, still get into difficulty. We need to send out clear signals in this regard.
The head of Goldman Sachs recently said - and we need to let these words sink in slowly - 'I am just a banker doing God's work'. That is surely a particularly cynical and perhaps blasphemous statement, but it shows the sort of mentality that many of these people have. They are speculating in the name of God, to put it bluntly. We do not want to claim that it is God's work that we are doing with our financial regulation, but rather it is work for the people, to protect the people of this continent from unemployment and speculation, and that is what we need to do. I hope that you will still be able to send out clear signals along these lines throughout the remainder of the Swedish Presidency.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Reinfeldt, and Mrs Malmström too, of course, on the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. It should be stressed that it is thanks to your determination that this was made possible; it is thanks to your sense of compromise that we finally achieved it. For there were many pessimists, including in this Chamber, who thought that we had to wait for the UK elections, or even stop waiting for the ratification of this treaty altogether. It is therefore thanks to you, and I thank you on behalf of everyone for the work that has been done. This means that almost 10 years of work are thus being crowned with success.
I also wish to thank you for today's debate, for having agreed to a debate with the group chairmen on the profiles of the High Representative and the President of the Council and on the structure of the Commission, because this will be the only debate on this issue. Nothing else is really being done transparently, I must say! We read many things in the press, and it is a good job that we still have the press to learn a little of what is going on, but I believe that, in future, we will have to think about how we can bring some transparency to a process that is extremely important for the European Union.
This is absolutely necessary. Why not install vice-presidents who would really take the lead, who would take responsibility for each of these groupings, which seem to result from the common sense shown within the Commission? This style of organisation would have the advantage of further improving the Commission's work under your presidency. On the other hand, there also has to be a balance as regards female representation within the Commission. I believe that it is also a concern of yours to have candidates who offer this possibility.
With regard to the second point, Mr President, namely the post of High Representative, the most important thing is that we have someone who has the will to conduct a consistent CFSP policy and consistent Community policies, someone who also defends human rights and who makes this a part of every task that he or she carries out. And, finally, we must have someone who believes in a powerful European External Action Service. Those are the three key elements that characterise this figure. We need someone who really believes that CFSP and Community policies must be integrated - which makes perfect sense, given that that person will also be Vice-President of the Commission.
Mr President, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, I believe that it is precisely the recollection of the historic events of 20 years ago that has now allowed us to see the wrangling over how to implement the options after ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is a critical light. Václav Havel's splendid words and his ideas about Europe, on the one hand, and the petty disputes over staffing that went on in the background during the last Council, on the other, do not go together, somehow.
In my view, it looks, at the moment, like the relief over the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon after almost ten years is giving way to concern about whether or not it will all be undermined in the governments of the Member States. However, what we actually need to strive for - particularly given how strongly we applauded Mr Havel's speech - and what we actually need to achieve is to agree that we need strong men and women to be appointed to the top political positions in the European Union and that individual interests, including the interests of the countries that are actually opposed to stronger integration, should take a step back.
It is wrong that Europeans have now adopted the stance that we have actually already done everything we can and now it is up to everyone else. If we look at what the Europeans have actually already done in terms of an efficient climate policy for reducing CO2 emissions, what has actually been achieved, the reduction targets we have set, the legislation in our climate package, none of that is sufficient to achieve the two-degree target that is constantly talked about. Everyone knows that, even at an international level.
If the Europeans now start to question whether we really want a legally binding agreement, it will call into question a process that, under the aegis of the United Nations, has been supported by many Europeans for many years. I think you need to think carefully about the announcements you make as you go to Copenhagen. There is always one concern at the back of my mind: it is frequently said in this House that sustainability strategies, resource efficiency and climate protection should be the new paradigms for European economic and industrial policy. Mr Havel also received a great deal of applause for this. I have the impression that Europeans - as often as they emphasise this and as much as they like to applaud it - have lost all faith in these future-oriented jobs during the economic crisis and that, therefore, precisely during this economic crisis, they are casting aside the successful strategies for creating new jobs and the markets of the future. This causes me serious concern. The economic crisis is the worst justification for not taking ambitious measures to protect the climate. Climate protection and economic development are actually two sides of the same coin. However, that is not at all evident in the European decisions being taken in the European Council.
What is worse, some have even tried to divide the European Union into two classes of citizenship by saying that only individuals coming from a Member State in the Schengen area and in the euro area should be eligible. That, I am afraid, is discrimination which is unacceptable, and this on a day of history when we remember all those who have fallen in warfare and in a week when we have remembered the horrors of Kristallnacht and the tragic events which followed, and where we have celebrated the achievement of all those who contributed to the fall of Communism, in Poland, where it began, in Hungary, in the Baltic States, in countries throughout Eastern and Central Europe and, of course, ultimately in Berlin.
Unfortunately, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not apply for the citizens of three Member States gives me doubts about the EU's great progress in the protection of fundamental rights. I mention this specifically in view of our celebratory sitting today and Václav Havel's speech. However, precisely because the Left in Europe wants a social, peaceful and environmentally sustainable European integration, we will also continue to use the framework provided by the treaty for this purpose. We have done this up to now, and we will continue to do so.
In this connection, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament will now have more rights. Amidst all the rejoicing, the Heads of State or Government would also have been well advised to use their recent summit for more tangible policies. The greatest challenge facing the world is climate change. In the run-up to the world climate conference in Copenhagen, the European Union has, unfortunately, lost the leading role that it had set itself. For one thing, the substance of the commitments to reduce CO2 emissions does not correspond to what is actually needed. Moreover, it is unacceptable that the EU Member States quite clearly want to avoid their financial responsibilities, even though this is a situation where we cannot afford to delay our action.
It is not about whether Sweden will soon become a great wine-growing region - although I do not begrudge you that. It is quite simply about survival and, incidentally, also about peace in our world. Climate change is already causing poverty and hunger and forcing millions of people to flee from their homelands. Everyone in this Chamber has surely spoken at one time or another of global challenges that cannot be overcome at national level. Climate protection, peace and combating poverty are just such challenges. If the European Union does not act in a consistent and exemplary manner in this regard, it will lose its acceptance as an international player.
(DE) Mr President, democracy needs a revolution, and it is never wrong, Mr Dartmouth, to speak out in favour of transparency, Mr Verhofstadt. You in particular, in the Swedish Presidency, could be a shining example of this and actually tell us what is going on in the horse trading for the top posts that is completely unworthy of the European Project and also - Mr Barroso could lead the way on this - with regard to the appointment of the commissioners. Germany and Austria are a poor example in this regard, but so, unfortunately, are others.
On the issue of balancing, because this is something that I also hear, I have just today had the first round of consultations with my 26 colleagues. The problem is that it is a lot of balancing for only two persons. You mentioned geography and gender, but the number one balancing that I am listening to is between Centre-Left and Centre-Right. There is a lot of balancing to do, and I would have liked more positions to be able to satisfy all the criteria that have been mentioned here. To say the obvious, it is not that we are not trying to find the best possible balance.
We need to do more - and we are not the ones asking to dilute the decision we need to take in Copenhagen - but a lot of work needs to be done to get others to move. As I said, I am back from my travels to India and the United States, and am going to China later in this month, and we need leadership agreement to get this going. That is the tough thing with this. It is a global challenge in a world where we do not have the kind of global leadership or decision taking that we have in the European Union. It is therefore much tougher to deliver but, at the same time, we need to do it.
But the reality is that some of our most important partners are simply not ready for it, so there are two possibilities. One is to insist on something that we know is not going to work, another is to try to have the most advanced and ambitious outcome at Copenhagen. I believe it is still possible, and we will fight for it. To have the most ambitious possible agreement at Copenhagen and - at least for the European Commission, and I am sure the Heads of State or Government agree - we will remain committed to a binding treaty that sets clear targets for the developed countries and clear actions for the developing countries, including the fast-growing, big emerging economies that also have a responsibility to share. We also need to provide funding to the developing countries - especially the poorest and the least developed countries - because we know very well that, without that support, they will not be able to make the adaptation and mitigation efforts that are needed.
I myself am one of those who believe that Europe stands still when one institution uses its power and its authority against the others. I believe that it is a mistake to act in that way. I believe that institutional jealousy is a characteristic shared by mediocre individuals. On the contrary, I believe that we will be stronger if we strengthen one another. I believe that it is entirely in our interests to have a strong European Parliament - and the Treaty of Lisbon gives it increased powers - but also to have a European Council with a consistent and coherent leadership over time, and a strong Commission.
Moreover, in accordance with the treaties, and I cite the Treaty of Lisbon - because we talk about it all the time, but we need to read it sometimes too - Article 17 of which states that it is the Commission that 'shall promote the general interest of the Union and take appropriate initiatives to that end. It shall ensure the application of the treaties, and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them.' In other words, it is the Commission's job to verify whether or not the treaties have been applied, including during this transition. This is a power that the treaty gives to the Commission and which the Commission will, of course, exercise within the scope of its responsibilities.
That being said, it is important to work on a partnership basis in order to strengthen the European institutions. If we do not have institutions that work, what will happen? The Member States - especially some Member States - will tend to take their own decisions outside of the institutions. Is that what we want? I do not think so. We want decisions to be taken within the institutional framework, within the framework of a Community based on the rule of law, and this is what I would like to say to you very frankly and very sincerely: let us mutually strengthen our institutions.
We have heard today the extraordinary plea made by Václav Havel. It is extraordinary, but as Jean Monnet said, nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions. We now need to put in place strong institutions, and that can only be done in this spirit of partnership. That is why, among other things, I wish to thank you for your suggestions concerning the organisation and structure of the Commission. Like you, I am very attached to the Community method and to the treaty, which provides for a clear division of responsibilities. Under the treaty, the responsibility for the organisation of the Commission falls to its President, and I have no intention of renouncing it.
Two years ago, in this House, I was saying that I was afraid that the Treaty of Lisbon might end up like the fish in The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway's novella, which, after a long battle, arrived at the harbour almost as a pile of bones. Well, I can see that the Treaty of Lisbon has not arrived at harbour as a pile of bones, but that its essence is still there. Thank you, Mr Reinfeldt; thank you, Cecilia.
Neither do I intend to give any advice, clearly, to the President-in-Office of the Council, but, if you will permit me, I would like to point out to you something that happened during the work done on the constitutional treaty. In the first draft, which created the post of the President of the Council, there was a proposal that this Council President should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years (as a joke, Mr Reinfeldt, we called it the 'Bruton clause', after John Bruton, because John told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months, and therefore would be eligible for the post). However, we later removed this condition - Mr Duff remembers - and we removed it because in this Parliament, we were asked what there was in the DNA of a prime minister that was not possessed by other mortals' DNA. Why must the President of the Council be a prime minister?
This pessimism is also evident in the conclusions from the last Council meeting. Admittedly, the Council confirms that the developed world must reduce its emissions by 80-95% by 2050, but if we are to succeed in doing this, ambitious commitments are needed in the very near future and, to achieve this, we must resolve the issue of the financing of the measures in the developing countries. It is those countries that have contributed least to climate change that will be affected most by it and if we do not resolve the issue of financing, we will not get a climate agreement either.
What promises is the Council making, then? Just as Mr Reinfeldt said here today, the EU has promised to make a reasonable contribution. In my view, this is an anticlimax. Would it have been possible to decide that the EU would not make a reasonable contribution? In my opinion, it is like starting to knit a glove and not getting any further than the thumb. The Commission has proposed aid in the region of EUR 5-7 billion during the first three years. The Council is choosing to take account of this and I find it very difficult to see it as a commitment of any value.
His position is badly designed from a democratic point of view. He cannot be the political President of Europe, he has to be no more than an honest broker between the different interests of the Member States in the Council, and the minimum requirement for his appointment is that there is a consensus in the Council. As Mr Verhofstadt has just said, when choosing a pope, we choose a Catholic, when choosing the President of the European Council, we choose a European, in other words, someone who believes in the European ideal. I think that is absolutely right. We need someone who can put the 'European' back into the European Council.
If there is one lesson to be learnt from Mr Havel's speech, it is how to be modest and how to be realistic. Let us stop pretending that everything stands still outside Europe, that the world has not changed since Kyoto, and that Europe is always far ahead of the international community. In refusing to take account of the requests of the European Parliament and, in particular, of its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council has assumed responsibility for something very serious: failure at the Copenhagen Summit.
Now, if this is an indication of what is to come, there is reason to fear how this issue will pan out with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon: are we sure that this dangerous path of having a European law that suppresses and rides roughshod over the Member States' laws will not be pursued? This is a danger that we must guard against. The Commission should have reacted much more firmly, not least because of the unanimous protest - today there has been a cross-party meeting of the Italian political parties represented here - which represents the sentiment and the depth of feeling of our people towards this belonging, which is metapolitical, metareligious and cultural, in the sense of a great philosopher, who taught us with the important words, 'we cannot say we are not Christians'.
The issue of the nominations is very important. Consequently, today, we are reading in press reports rumours of meetings; we do not even know whether there will have to be an extraordinary meeting in Brussels. I do wonder about something, however: studying the names that are circulating - for example, Jan Peter Balkenende, David Miliband and Herman Van Rompuy, to name but three - can it be possible that no one has noticed that all three regularly attend meetings of both the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission? I believe that we must establish principles of transparency, which are so often spoken about by our institutions, and we must ask these people clearly whether they are candidates representing their countries and their political parties, or representing secret groups that meet behind closed doors and take decisions over the heads of the peoples.
Madam President, as you just said, the summit between the EU and Russia will take place in Stockholm on 18 November. It is a good opportunity for the EU to evaluate relations between ourselves and Russia. I know that many Members here in Parliament are following developments in Russia very closely. I would therefore like to present the main issues that we intend to discuss during the summit, and I am sure that the Commissioner would like to add more details about the areas relating to the Commission's sphere of responsibility.
In general, clearly we want to use the summit to develop the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia. We have a lot to gain from cooperation with Russia in all areas. We need Russia if we are to be able to deal with the global challenges effectively. However, we must also make it clear to Russia that our partnership must be based on respect for a common commitment and common values. That means respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The summit will give us the opportunity to exert pressure on Russia to fulfil its contractual obligations in these areas and in other areas, too.
We will, of course, discuss the economic and financial crisis. The Council would like an agreement at the summit on the need for continued, coordinated efforts as a response to the crisis and confirms that we will insist on our economies being open and on the necessity to avoid protectionist measures. The summit will also give us the chance to assess the progress made in our work relating to the four common spaces. We will use the opportunity to stress the importance of making progress in the areas where it is needed or where problems have arisen.
I am very well aware of the great concern that the European Parliament has about the human rights situation in Russia. Evidence of this can be seen, in particular, in your decision to award this year's Sakharov Prize to human rights defenders in Russia. The Swedish Presidency shares your concern and we will ensure that human rights issues will have a prominent place in discussions at the summit. Of course, we welcome President Medvedev's statement on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, but this must be followed by concrete actions. The human rights situation in Russia is disturbing. We will highlight, in particular, the most recent events in the North Caucasus, which has been the scene of violence against human rights defenders, crime prevention personnel, representatives of the authorities and the population at large. It is particularly worrying that human rights defenders and journalists have been killed, not only in the North Caucasus, but also in Russia as a whole. We will therefore reiterate our appeal to Russia to do its utmost to ensure that human rights defenders can carry out their work without having to live in fear of violence, harassment or threats.
We will raise the matter of Georgia and reiterate that Russia must fully honour its commitments under the six-point plan laid down on 12 August and, subsequently, the agreement of 8 September 2008. We must also regain the necessary trust with regard to Akhalgori, Upper Kodori and the checkpoint in Perevi. We will also call on Russia to use its influence to grant the EU Monitoring Mission access to the Georgian areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in accordance with its country-wide mandate. The summit will also give us the opportunity to assess progress made at the Geneva talks, and in this regard, we expect Russia to continue its committed approach.
Russia's active commitment to promoting dialogue between the Armenian and the Azerbaijan presidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh matter is, of course, welcome. However, we will also point out to Russia the importance of involving the Minsk Group in all stages of the process. The EU is prepared to get involved in and support the Minsk Process, among other things, through measures to promote trust. The summit should express its support for the ratification and implementation of the new protocols between Armenia and Turkey. Other matters in this area relate to the Euro-Atlantic Security Partnership and the Eastern Partnership.
With regard to Euro-Atlantic Security, we will urge Russia to take an active part in the Corfu Process prior to a forward-looking decision being taken in Athens. The summit should ask for Russia's confirmation that it supports the fundamental principles of the process, in other words, complete respect for and implementation of the regulations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), that the OSCE is the main forum for debate on the Corfu Process, and the fact that all aspects of the overarching security strategy should be dealt with in a balanced way.
As far as the EU is concerned, we are willing to inform Russia of all incidents relating to the Eastern Partnership and reiterate that third countries may, on a case-by-case basis, be entitled to take part, in accordance with the joint declaration in Prague of May 2009. The summit will also allow us to raise a number of international and regional issues. I think it is extremely likely that issues such as Iran, Afghanistan/Pakistan, the South Caucasus and, of course, the Middle East will be raised.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, just a year ago, we reviewed EU-Russian relations and decided that the European Union should - despite our major differences with Russia over the conflict in Georgia - pursue cooperation with this major neighbour, including on the negotiation of the new agreement. We also concluded that we should base our relations on the assessment of our own self-interest. The Stockholm Summit next week will therefore focus on areas - as has been said already - where there is mutual interest, for example, climate change and energy, and the global economic crisis.
Clearly, we believe that the best way forward is to work together in a rules-based multilateral format. The summit will be an opportunity to again stress the importance of Russia's WTO accession. Russia's intention to complete negotiations in parallel with Belarus and Kazakhstan, with which it is planning a customs union, still leaves many questions unanswered. At the same time, we hope to get a better understanding of Russia's new approach at the summit. This is important, not least in the context of the ongoing negotiations for the new agreement which are being held by the Commission and which must contain clear, legally binding provisions on trade and investment and also on energy.
On energy security, work continues on an enhanced early warning mechanism. We regret Russia's withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), but we recall that the principles of the ECT were affirmed under Russia's presidency of the G8, for instance, in the St Petersburg Declaration. These should therefore form the basis of our work on energy security under the new EU-Russia agreement. While we should be ready to discuss Russia's wish for a wider debate on international energy security architecture, I think we will also want, above all, to establish the essentials of our bilateral energy relationship.
President Medvedev's proposal for a wider discussion of Euro-Atlantic security has led to a new process of talks under the aegis of the OSCE. I think it is now important that this debate does not distract us from the immediate task of resolving today's frozen conflicts. The EU-Russia strategic partnership must - as was said before - be based on common commitments in the area of human rights and democracy. Russia has entered into commitments as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and these have to be upheld.
We must look together with Russia to a new global security arrangement or agreement. I think that the Medvedev initiative should not be immediately rejected. Some think that there is an agenda behind this initiative which we cannot accept. Others think that there is no agenda and it is a mere test of our reactions. Whatever is behind it, our current security arrangements are rooted in different times and we have to update them. We have to see what is still valid and we have to add something new to them.
Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that Russia has always valued strong partners highly. And today's preparation for the summit taking place in a week's time actually shows, as far as the European Union is concerned, that if we want to, we can speak with one voice. And this is very important - as is indeed shown by the resolution we have prepared - and in listening therefore to the council and the representatives of the Commission, I have a very good feeling about this. Also, the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, needless to say, creates a larger and wider basis for this.
Now, though, let us look at this from the point of view of Russia. Actually, Russia has a very good opportunity next week to show a sincere desire to cooperate with us, whether in areas such as energy security or the preparation of a new framework agreement between the European Union and Russia, or, for example, guidelines for behaviour and thought on Russia's part in moving towards the WTO. It is true that at the moment, there are some ambivalent attitudes: President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin have given out different signals. I very much hope that next week, the European Union will gain some clarity on what kind of course Russia will therefore take towards the WTO. And certainly the European Union, I think, must support Russia in its movement towards the WTO.
Ladies and gentlemen, it has very frequently been said over the past year that relations between the European Union and Russia should be made more pragmatic, and already I myself have heard people question this point: whether therefore, the European Union is just throwing aside human rights, basic values and the subject of democracy. I think that on no account should we do this, because if we did, then we would devalue ourselves completely, as well as the European Union as a whole. And bringing up human rights is not in any way to persecute Russia, push them into the corner or lecture them; bringing up human rights is, first and foremost, about looking after the people living in Russia; that is, protecting ordinary citizens.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this year, we are not only celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall and the peaceful revolution, but 1989 was also the year that saw the death of Andrei Sakharov, who played a significant part in the fall of the totalitarian Eastern Bloc system. Andrei Sakharov also left us the advice that his country needs understanding and pressure - emphatic pressure. However, I would not translate the word davlenie as pressure these days, but rather as emphatic support and, indeed, emphatic support in all areas where Russia is moving towards modernisation and where the signs of a social market economy, democracy and the rule of law are beginning to emerge.
However, as Václav Havel said earlier today, partnership also requires us to tell each other the whole truth. I would therefore like to say this: where elections are falsified, even the concept of steered democracy begins to create cynicism, and therefore the monitoring of elections is extremely important. Where critical journalists are murdered, the truth also dies. We are not making any progress with our 'change through trade' approach. Instead, we must place our relationship with Russia on a firm basis of values.
Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot imagine that EU representatives guided by a resolution drafted by the European Parliament will manage to achieve a result in Stockholm. If the Russian delegation has a similar recommendation, the summit is doomed to failure. Do we want the negotiations to assist cooperation between the EU and Russia? Of course we do. Russia is often described in the document as a key partner of the EU. However, almost everything is expressed in terms of demands and conditions rather than proposals. For example, responsibility for the success of the climate conference in Copenhagen is placed on Russia. It was Russia, nonetheless, that rescued the Kyoto Protocol, while the US refused to ratify it. At the same time, the unrealistic positions adopted in relation to Russia include the task of sorting out media freedom. The situation is definitely not ideal. At the same time, ladies and gentlemen, in the case of Italy, we decided during the last plenary session that this was an internal matter. Italy happens to be a Member State of the Union. So what are we hoping to achieve in Russia? If Russia is supposed to be an important partner, let us negotiate with her on that basis.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be abstaining from the vote on this motion for a resolution because I find it somewhat contradictory. It is, in fact, acknowledged within the resolution that economic cooperation between Russia and Europe has vastly improved over the last 10 years. It is recognised that Russia has strengthened relations in the areas of energy, trade, visa liberalisation, illegal immigration control, the fight against terrorism, climate change and foreign policy, and on issues such as Iranian nuclear weaponry, and peacemaking in the Caucasus and the Middle East.
It is indeed 20 years ago that the Berlin Wall collapsed, putting an end to Soviet Communist dictatorship. Hungarians were among the greatest victims of this dictatorship. I must mention two additional facts. First of all, the status quo was able to continue for decades because the Western powers also wanted to maintain this situation after the Second World War. Secondly, the Soviet Union did not equate even then with the Russian people, who also suffered from Communist dictatorship. Russia is obviously our extremely important economic and strategic partner.
The agreement reached by the largest political groups in the European Parliament on a joint and, indeed, very good motion for a resolution is a step which I value highly. However, I think it could be even better if we included a third amendment stressing the importance of EU-Russian cooperation in the area of energy, but also showing the basis on which such cooperation should take place. This means that, especially at a time of economic and financial crisis, this cooperation should be based on keeping the financial costs to a minimum, but also that all conditions related to the supply of energy should be stated.
The final matter concerns security. I would like to say a few words about the proposal of my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), for a debate to be held on the subject of the Russian-Belarussian military exercises which assumed the need to repel a potential attack from Western Europe, from the territory of countries belonging to the European Union and NATO. It was with great regret that I received information that this debate had not found a place on the order of business and would not be the subject of discussion.
I have two brief points to make. My first point relates to Russia's accession to the WTO and my sincere request, including to the Council and the Commission, is to provide as much support as possible for this. Of course, Russia must play its part, too, but we are both relying on this and it would be good for both of us if developments in this regard were to move in a positive direction. The fact that Russia wants to join the WTO and not just enter into a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan is a step in the right direction.
My second point is a sincere request for us not to lose sight of the development of our cooperation in the areas of science and research as well as in the area of civil society. We need a new impetus for cultural exchange as well as youth exchanges, not only in one direction, as Mr Gahler said, but in both directions. Every young person who takes part in this will develop an understanding for others and will become a messenger for a more positive development of our relations. I hope that we will talk more about these common interests and that these aspects will also assume greater importance.
Today, we want to feel safe at last in the structures of a Europe of free nations, and so all the more we must not fail to see how Russia is trying to rebuild its empire, and that it has never come to terms with the loss of that empire. This is why Russia attacked Georgia. This is why it is carrying out what is, to all intents and purposes, the Anschluss of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, why it is threatening Ukraine, why it is interfering in the anti-missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, and why it uses its energy resources in a form of blackmail. This is why there is something both symbolic and sinister in the fact that just before the EU-Russia Summit, the country which currently has the Presidency of the European Union and is hosting the summit - Sweden - has withdrawn its ecological veto of the Nord Stream project. Nord Stream does not make any economic sense, and its sole objective is to cancel in practice the principle of energy solidarity, which was supposed to be one of the main principles and ideals of the Lisbon Treaty.
(DA) Madam President, in Russia, there is freedom of the press in name only, not in practice. Critical journalists are intimidated, persecuted and murdered. Russia is ranked 153 in the worldwide press freedom index - in other words, press freedom in Russia is now worse than in Belarus, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Should this really be rewarded? Yet it does not stop there. We have the issue of gas supplies to European citizens. Again this year, we are seeing Russia threatening to disrupt gas supplies and there are indications that we will need to prepare for this possibility every winter in future. Yet can it really be right that we reward Russia for this?
Our approach to the next EU-Russia Summit lacks the courage and sincerity required for a serious treatment of the fundamental questions which today stand between the EU and Russia. If there is no sincerity within the EU, if, only a few days after final ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in the Czech Republic, words about energy solidarity have no meaning, and further steps are taken towards building the northern gas pipeline; if, in our relations, there is no serious treatment of the Energy Charter or the Sarkozy Plan, or of the recent Russian military manoeuvres on Poland's eastern border, we will not achieve anything.
At the same time, Russia is, without a doubt, an important strategic partner for Europe, and not only in terms of energy supply. We will soon see whether the new memorandum to prevent energy crises and the European early warning system are worth the paper they are written on - at least we will when the next gas dispute arises. The fact is that our dependence on Russian gas cannot be eliminated easily and even the Nabucco project will barely make a difference to this situation. It would be naive to believe that Tehran would not be able to put pressure on Europe.
(LT) I support Mr Zalewski's position, to be precise, Amendment No 1, since it draws serious attention to two questions that are crucial for the European Union. Firstly, we do not approve of the way the third country arrogantly ignores and rejects the EU as its equal and respected partner in matters of external energy security that are important to the European Union. Secondly, we do not approve of the anti-European dividing line, which of course, the third country is implementing in the 'Nord Stream' gas pipeline project. We must oppose the lobbyist and, at times, corrupt division of Europe, and must not condone Russia's arrogance towards us, by which I mean the European Parliament. We cannot allow Gazprom - the principal 'Nord Stream' shareholder - to completely ignore our Parliament's resolution on the threats the gas pipeline poses to the environment.
The problem is not simply the tragic ecological state of the Baltic Sea, but also our institution's moral condition. When we voted here last year, we demanded that an evaluation of the impact on the environment be carried out, one that is independent and not bought in advance, and that guarantees be given to nations on the shores of the Baltic should there be a disaster. Gazprom did not even bother to answer Europe. That is like spitting in Parliament's face and we cannot respond by saying 'Yes, sir, great pleasure'. We must behave with dignity and honour without manipulating or blocking the special debates currently initiated by MEPs on problems concerning Baltic Sea life. If, struck by fear, we agree to the murdering of the Baltic and a new Moscow-Berlin border in the sea with Russian Naval vessels protecting the pipeline, we will bury our free future. Indeed, while chatting about energy, we are selling our future.
(DE) Madam President, indeed, we must take Russia seriously, as Mr Kowal said, in particular, after the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, with regard to which it is interesting that the President who long refused to sign the treaty, Václav Klaus, has taken a particularly uncritical stance towards Russia. Taking Russia seriously means developing a sensible relationship and a pragmatic economic relationship with Russia, but it does not mean that we should not be critical of political developments within Russia, particularly with regard to human rights issues.
It was with great regret that we discovered what happened during the last elections, that things were clearly not quite as they should have been. We are, of course, particularly concerned about the attacks on human rights defenders. I do not want to lay the blame for these attacks at the door of the Russian Government. What I do want, and what we demand in this resolution, which is a very balanced one, is for Russia to take the protection of these human rights defenders seriously. That is not happening, at least not to a sufficient degree. In this regard, we should focus more on President Medvedev than Prime Minister Putin. The differences may not be very large, but if either has taken a reasonably enlightened, positive stance, it is surely President Medvedev, and we should strengthen and support him in that.
As regards the energy issue: here, too, we need to cultivate a very calm, reasonable relationship. I have nothing against Nord Stream, or against South Stream, but I do not want to be dependent on anyone, not on any one country, for our gas supply. I am therefore very much in favour of the Nabucco pipeline. Multiplicity, diversification - that is the crucial factor in gas supply connection, whether it comes via a different pipeline, like Nabucco, or via LNG ports. This is not because the country in question is Russia, but because Europe should not be dependent on anyone.
It has been a solemn day for us here today: we have commemorated the fall of the Berlin Wall. However, what we failed to recall is that, at the same time, another important wall collapsed in Russia, and that the process of transition, which is still in progress, began. Today, Russia is a better country than it was before the fall of the Berlin Wall and sometimes we need to remind ourselves of that. Sometimes we should give Russia, our important partner, credit for that and not allow ourselves to be carried away solely by the emotions aroused by our own history.
Mrs Malmström also referred to this, for which I thank her. You spoke as if the European Union were preparing for a summit with Switzerland. You spoke about trade, about business, about the climate package, and completely forgot about significant matters, about what is perhaps most significant for the European Union. My wish for you, for us and, above all, for the citizens of the Russian Federation, is that the EU will more often present the position outlined today by Mrs Malmström rather than the one you presented.
In this regard, we need to be very clear and I believe that those who have criticised me, Mrs Rosbach for example, probably did not listen to my introductory speech, because I said very clearly then that we are concerned about developments in relation to human rights in Russia. Russia is an important neighbour. We do, of course, have many unresolved issues and perhaps none of us believes that we will resolve all of the issues at the summit in Stockholm. However, it is a valuable opportunity to meet and to talk.
We have common issues in which we will perhaps be able to get a little closer to a solution. There is the question of the Middle East and Afghanistan, and at the moment, of course, the climate summit in Copenhagen is very relevant. Then there is the financial and economic crisis and our common commitments in this regard, as well as our relations with regard to energy, accession to the WTO and various issues relating to foreign and security policy. We need to cooperate with regard to conflict settlement in our common space. It is about identifying specific issues where both parties will benefit from cooperation. We must do this in a correct and respectful way, without abandoning our values.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Russia is a strategic partner on the one hand but also a neighbour, and as a neighbour, it is more complicated. However, especially at a time of economic uncertainty, I think it is all the more important to ensure that the relationship between Europe and Russia works as effectively as possible to deliver security, stability and prosperity for our citizens and also for Russia's citizens. We must therefore redouble our efforts to find common ground on issues where our views differ - for instance on human rights questions or on questions on the common neighbourhood - but also to keep the door open for dialogue and debate that respects our differences but also respects our common commitments. This is, so to say, the general line.
Now let me say a few very specific things. Russia's WTO accession is, and remains, a key objective for us. In so saying, it is time to resolve several issues that remain outstanding in this trade relationship. Some of these, such as the Transnistrian overflight charges, have been on our agenda for many years. They have always been mentioned at the many summits I have been on. Others, such as the proposed decree limiting the transport of containers by road, are more recent, and I personally - and all the Commission services - raise these issues whenever we talk to Russia. Indeed, we just had a permanent partnership council, but of course, we could again do so.
The second item I want to mention is energy. The European Union and Russia are, as I said, also important partners in the energy field. The relation is one of interdependence, which offers both sides a strong motivation to put our energy relations on a predictable and also on a concrete basis. Ensuring an unhindered and uninterrupted energy supply to the European Union, thus preventing and overcoming emergency situations, is therefore of the utmost importance. This is what we aim to achieve with, for instance, the Early Warning Mechanism on which we are working and where it is important that we work with the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation. We have discussed this issue and I do hope that we can move on.
With regard to human rights, I did speak about human rights. We have spoken about human rights whenever we have been at the summit. I would like to say a few words on the death penalty, because this is, of course, not acceptable for us according to our community of values. Yes, the constitutional court in Russia is debating this issue at the moment, but we were told that there are indications that the court will conclude that Russia is bound by its signature of Protocol 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and thus, will most probably not apply the death penalty. Let us hope that this will indeed be true.
At the onset of winter, Europe is being threatened by a gas crisis similar to that at the start of this year when dependency on Russian gas was more apparent than ever. There is likely to be a repeat this year too of the scenario which unfolded last winter, which Prime Minister Putin recently drew attention to, again based on a misunderstanding with Ukraine. In this context, the alternative to Russian gas, the Nabucco project, becomes an absolute necessity. Gas supplies to Europe cannot depend on conflicts between Russia and Ukraine. It is becoming imperative for all EU organisations to make Nabucco a priority, just as the European Council also actually decided in March. The EU must speak with a single voice on the Nabucco project. It is in Russia's interest to have access to Caspian gas, and a resolute, united front from Europe would bring Russia to the same negotiating table. We are not getting involved with competition between projects. We are not talking about Nord Stream versus South Stream. What we are talking about is the shared interest in ensuring an alternative source of gas. Last but not least, European institutions must make a strong appeal to Russia and Ukraine not to let feelings of pride dictated by geopolitical or electoral interests affect the security of the EU's population and economies.
in writing. - (HU) The renegotiation of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides a good opportunity for both sides to review the issues which most clearly define their relations. In the wake of the events of the last few years, it is no coincidence that the agenda for the negotiations reflects the growing role of energy exchanges. Judging from the press, we can by no means be sure that this year we will escape the gas crisis, which is becoming a regular fixture. The EU Gas Supply Directive, which has not yet been adopted, will not be worth anything, unfortunately, if EU Member States once again wake up to shut-off taps. This is precisely why the EU must endeavour to make the basic principles of the Energy Charter, still to be ratified by Russia, an integral part of the new cooperation agreement. At present, both the issue of energy transit and market accessibility are fraught with contradictions. Indeed, as long as Russia, taking advantage of the market's openness, is still involved as an investor in most EU Member States, it will consistently close off its own market to Western companies. The Energy Charter may resolve this contradiction. Recording market principles in writing may provide a good basis during the negotiation of future long-term gas supply contracts as well. If they fail to establish transparent relations, it will still be possible to play off Member States against one another in the future as they continue to pay different prices for gas supplies.
As we, the European Parliament, are about to present this year's Sakharov Prize to the 'Memorial' Foundation, including to one of the founders of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Mrs Lyudmila Mikhailovna Alexeyeva, we must underline that this Parliament, this Union, is more than just about business and making sure that gas arrives as cheaply as possible. We are a union of values, including those of civil liberties, democracy, human rights and human dignity. Next week, our European leaders during the summit need to speak about more than pipelines and free trade. It is not yet time to let the candle of Russian civil society burn out. Thank you
It is very important for us to have good relations and a good partnership with Russia. At the same time, efforts are being made at developing the Eastern Partnership, which aims to activate EU relations with Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Despite the many declarations made by the European Union and by Poland about cooperation with the Russian Federation, my concern is aroused by the fact that in September, thousands of Russian soldiers took part in military exercises named 'West 2009' in Belarus. The objective of these exercises was to put down a fictitious rising of the Polish ethnic minority. The holding of joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises on the assumption that the aggressor is one of the Member States of the European Union is extremely disturbing. In addition, it surprises me that there has been no reaction to this from the European Commission or from the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. I hope this subject will be raised during the forthcoming European Union-Russia Summit, which will be held in Stockholm on 18 November.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barrot, and all of you attending here today, the European Parliament firmly supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans. That is also the core idea that has guided us throughout the preparation of the report. I would like to express my compliments, in particular, to the shadow rapporteurs and members of Parliament, as without their support I would not have been able to achieve this result. Likewise, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their collaborative efforts which will form the firm bedrock of future cooperation in this area, especially once the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified, as that will enable Parliament to adopt any necessary measures through the codecision procedure.
The citizens of the Western Balkans have been isolated by the visa regime for far too long. They have fewer rights today, as regards free travel, than they did in the days of the former Yugoslavia. What young people from the countries of the Western Balkans know about Europe, or America for that matter, today is what they learn from the internet and television. As I come from Slovenia, I can recall that it was actually the Slovene Presidency which initiated the process of visa regime liberalisation in early 2008, five years after the signing of the Thessaloniki Agenda, which guarantees an unambiguous European perspective for the population of the Western Balkans.
I am pleased to welcome the Commission's proposal for the abolition of the visa requirement for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and I am particularly pleased to welcome Slovenia's initiative, which has received strong support from the Member States and which allows the citizens of these countries to start travelling freely to the countries of the Schengen area from 19 December. 1 January 2010 would have entailed logistical difficulties, as the Christmas and New Year holiday period is exactly the time when many citizens of these countries want to travel to visit their relations living in the Member States.
Ladies and gentlemen, the abolition of visas for the three countries I have mentioned is a very positive step in the right direction. However, I should point out that the countries which were omitted from the visa abolition framework should be allowed to join it as soon as possible or, rather, as soon as they are ready to do so. Naturally, I am talking about Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. We cannot allow them to become ever more isolated, at a time when their neighbouring countries are enjoying the possibility of unlimited travel into the European Union.
Of course, they need to be prepared for visa abolition and I do not mean to suggest here that we need to lower our criteria. What we want to do is to send a clear message to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania: We are waiting for you; you must urge your governments to fulfil their side of the bargain. We, on the other hand, will do everything in our power to ensure that there are no delays in decision making on the European Union's side. I can safely say that this approach has met with the broad support of two committees, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which is my parent committee.
I would also add that, tomorrow after the vote, I will ask for the floor in order to deliver a special political statement, a common statement of Parliament and the Council, which strongly supports the abolition of the visa requirement for all the countries of the Western Balkans. In this statement, on which we shall vote separately tomorrow, we will both welcome 19 December, the date when the visa requirement will be abolished for Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and call on the European Commission to prepare, as soon as possible, a proposal that the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania be abolished as soon as they have met the relevant criteria. We, on the other hand, undertake to deal with this proposal under an expedited procedure. I would like us to set a clear date for the abolition of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, although I am aware of the demanding nature of the procedures involved. I hope that the summer of 2010 will prove to be a realistic date for the abolition of the visa requirement for these two countries.
I understand Parliament's position. I would like, in this connection, to confirm the Commission's strong commitment to monitor closely the fulfilment, by all of the countries concerned, of all the criteria laid down in the road map. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had already been the subject of a positive assessment; the dialogue was therefore concluded with that country. In October, Serbia and Montenegro hosted missions led by the Commission, in association with the experts from the Member States, and those missions confirmed that all of the criteria of the respective road maps had been fulfilled properly.
We are going to follow the same method for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite the very significant progress made over the last few months, Bosnia and Albania have not yet been able to complete the necessary reforms requested in the road map to justify the exemption of the visa requirement. However, as you just said, Mrs Fajon, it is already very encouraging for them to hear that their neighbours already have this option of being exempted from the visa requirement, and I can confirm to you that I personally will do everything in my power to ensure that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina can obtain this visa exemption as quickly as possible, as you want.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Madam President, the commitment supported in the Fajon report and backed by the proposed Council and Parliament declaration is a far-sighted one. It is to give visa-free travel to all the people of the Western Balkans. This is not solely a generous and altruistic move. It is also hard-headed and shrewd, since security in the widest sense of the word will be promoted and advanced. People who are free, and free to travel, tend to be committed to peaceful solutions and less prey to introverted nationalism which is a security threat.
I would also like to add the hope that the Government of the United Kingdom - which is not included in the present decision of the EU Schengen zone by virtue, of course, of not being a member - will also shortly follow the same path. I always feel a certain schizophrenia when working on these matters on the Schengen projects because I am a British MEP, but it obviously would be a good thing both for the European Union and for the Western Balkan region if the UK were to follow suit as quickly as possible.
We understand the plea of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania - a young generation which has been locked in and left out and feels imprisoned. To them we say: 'We are on your side; we are ready when you are ready'. It is regrettable that the slow start by the authorities in Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina left them behind. The responsibility for any delays rests with them. We exhort them to meet the benchmarks as soon as possible. We know that the Commission is helping in that process.
As Mrs Ludford said, very correctly, there are deep practical considerations as to why this is important for us and why this is not just a reactive measure. So, on behalf of the Socialist and Democrat Group, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, for the careful and painstaking work she has undertaken to move the European Union towards this ultimate goal of abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans. This has been done with the shadow rapporteurs and with the Commission and Council, and it should be commended.
Madam President, I would first like to join with the previous speaker in expressing my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs, Mrs Fajon and Mrs Ludford, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and also to the shadow rapporteurs. We have succeeded in presenting a proposal demanding that the Commission and the Council come up with an overall package for all the people of the entire Western Balkans, leaving no one out. I very much hope - and I am addressing Commissioner Barrot in this regard - that you can convince the Council that the goal of visa liberalisation should also apply to Kosovo, so the dialogue will now begin, and so that visa liberalisation will also be achieved for Bosnia and Albania by no later than the middle of next year. I would prefer it to be sooner.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, twenty years ago, my fellow countrymen from East Germany obtained the freedom to travel. A few years later, Slobodan Milošević arbitrarily jeopardised and then took away the freedom of travel for Serbs and then for all other countries in the region. How often since 2000 have we in this House, in declarations and in public debates, wished for the freedom of travel - visa-free travel - for the countries of South-Eastern Europe. We know that the EU cannot achieve this alone, as the national governments need to agree to it. We need to overcome the anxieties in our population. Criminals are everywhere - they do not need a visa! They cross borders without a visa. That is therefore not something that we should be concerned about.
It is about the young generation, who, with the help of visa-free travel, can finally go wherever they want to. We are therefore very pleased that the citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will now finally be able to travel freely again. How wonderful! There is still a hint of sadness in that Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo cannot yet join them, but in December, we expect the Commission to acknowledge the huge progress that Albania has made and to see that Bosnia and Herzegovina has also made a certain amount of improvement. Unfortunately, there are politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina who are less concerned about the interests of their citizens, as they are secure in the knowledge that they themselves, of course, have visa-free travel. I therefore believe that we need to ensure that this is possible by next summer. I hope that Mr Barrot will help us in that. However, we must not forget Kosovo. It must not be the last remaining black mark. We are obliged to help Kosovo to meet the benchmarks. It cannot do it alone. Visa-free travel is a deeply humanitarian act. I am pleased that we were all in a position to make this happen. Thank you for this opportunity, Mr Barrot.
The Western Balkans have only recently gone through an extremely traumatic period of war, causing great suffering to a huge number of people. Progress needs to be made with the process of European integration in order to overcome this event. Visa-free travel is an important step in this. Several people have mentioned the opportunity it would provide young people with to establish direct contact and gain first-hand experience, as well as the opportunity for democratic forces to grow in strength. It is not only about providing a message of trust and visa-free travel. Europe can also benefit from the Western Balkans moving closer to the European Union from a security and economic policy perspective. However, it is important that we do not create new divisions in the region, but ensure that every country can participate in the visa-free travel scheme as soon as possible.
(SL) For the citizens of the Western Balkans, the abolition of the visa requirement for travel to the European Union does not only have a technical dimension, but an exceptional political charge and significance as well. Today, we rightly commemorated in Parliament the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and of full-blown socialism. However, Skopje, Podgorica and Belgrade will, during this Christmas and New Year, finally get to celebrate the fall of a visa wall which has separated them from us in the European Union for almost 12 years.
However, the Macedonians, the Montenegrins and the Serbs should be joined by the Bosnians and Herzegovinians, the Albanians and the Kosovars as early as possible in 2010. That alone will enable the new generations of those countries to finally see and experience the outside world, establish contacts with other Europeans, contribute to the development of European values at home and equip their nations for fully-fledged membership in our common European story - the European Union.
This is why this proposal should be welcomed. However, we must not forget that the issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one, while it is a very clear political matter at the same time. This is why it is important. I also support the acceptance of the Joint Declaration because this signals that the European institutions have understood this responsibility. This responsibility also means action at the same time. First of all, it means action by the relevant states which have been unable to meet the visa-free travel conditions to fulfil these requirements as soon as possible, not to mention action from the European Commission without whose help this process would drag on.
(DE) Madam President, I believe that we are on the right track with regard to the Balkan States. We have drawn closer through visa facilitation and that will help to create stability, although it is also a sign of our appreciation of the efforts that have been made. However, I also think that it is good for us to retain a clear set of rules and for the requirements relating to these also to be complied with. In this regard, I would particularly like to thank Mrs Corazza Bildt for the efforts she has made.
However, at the same time, I wish to deplore the fact that this report ultimately did not feature any reference at all to a country included in the Eastern Partnership. I believe that it needed to be associated with Moldova, if only symbolically. We are talking about Moldova, a country which has made considerable progress on the political front. I think that the most solid wall we know in Europe is on the eastern border, between Romania and Moldova. I believe we must deplore this fact.
At the same time as thanking all of the speakers and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs Fajon, I would simply like to say, Madam President, that, ever since part of the decisions were pretty much taken for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, we have offered continual assistance to Albania, which I have visited personally, and to Bosnia and Herzegovina, precisely so as to help them make progress - and we shall continue to do so.
in writing. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur and shadow rapporteur for drafting an acceptable compromise on this matter. The issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one. It is also a very definite political matter. Visa-free travel is based on mutual trust and commitments. This is why I also support the acceptance of the Joint Declaration, in addition to the report, because this signals that the European institutions have understood this responsibility.
As a Hungarian MEP, I would like once again to mention that, thanks to visa-free travel status for Serbia, a more direct link is being established between Hungarians living in Vojvodina in Serbia and the mother country, not to mention with Europe too. Citizens who live on either side of these borders, speak the same language and foster close family and cultural ties are unable, for their part, to find sufficient words to express the importance of being able to cross borders without any barrier or visa. Today we are marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and cutting through the barbed wire. Guaranteeing the crossing of borders in the case of Western Balkan countries becomes part of the series of events that started 20 years ago, like a new wall collapsing
author. - Mr President, I come from Latvia, a country hit severely by the financial crisis. Latvia was at risk of going bankrupt without financial assistance from outside. We received such assistance from the EU and the IMF. However, as a precondition, the Latvian Government had to cut budgetary spending. It did so by reducing pensions by 10% and the pensions of working pensioners by 70%, reducing family benefits and maternity benefits for working parents by 10%, as well as reducing non-taxable personal income tax thresholds.
A few months have passed and we have received quite a few reports from NGOs, trade unions and citizens about one of the four countries that have received very significant amounts of assistance to public finances: EUR 6.5 billion, 3.1 billion, 2.2 billion and 5 billion. They are giving us figures such as those which my fellow Member just quoted: cuts of 40% in the education sector; cuts of 10% in the pensions programme; a halving of subsidies for the ill, etc.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problems in Latvia, Hungary and Romania, which are the three European Union countries that are currently receiving loans through the balance of payments facility, are problems that have not been created by this Parliament, or the European Commission, or the European Union. They are problems created by the economic crisis, but they have been aggravated by mismanagement and misguided policies undertaken by the political leaders of those countries. I say this because there are countries in the same region of the European Union as Latvia, in the same region of the European Union as Hungary, and in the same region of the European Union as Romania, which are not having the same problems, and which are doing a better job of tackling the crisis, with support from European budgets, through the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, with the protection given by membership of the European Union and prospective membership of the euro, but without the need to ask for assistance from the balance of payments facility.
How are we helping them? We are doing so by lending them money; and nobody makes loans without conditions; we do not have the authorisation of this Parliament or of the Council to make loans without conditions. We are lending upon certain conditions, and we are imposing on those countries some conditions which are tough, because their situations are extraordinarily difficult, but we are saying to them: 'do not make cuts in order to be able to cofinance the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund; do not adopt retrogressive measures; do not make cuts that damage the weakest'. Sometimes we are successful and sometimes, unfortunately, we are unsuccessful, because the matter is not in our hands, but in theirs.
What we do do is to remind the governments and parliaments of those countries, firstly, of their responsibility for extricating their countries from a crisis which other countries are not suffering to such a serious extent; and secondly, that there are measures that cannot be taken, and we are not prepared to lend money so that measures are adopted that go beyond what is strictly necessary to adjust public finances and place those countries in a position to tackle their futures without the need to ask the European Union for loans.
Mr President, Commissioner, you will very clearly recall that when, on 24 April - as my colleague, Mr Cercas, pointed out - we endorsed, validated and ratified the increase in the balance of payments facility, we did so on two conditions: firstly, that this aid come with conditions attached, particularly in the case of social aid; and, secondly, that there be transparency, so that this House would be clear about the conditions under which such agreements were concluded with the Member States in question. I therefore believe that the debate that we are holding this evening is a just, useful and democratic debate and one which must provide evidence of effective action.
However, I would not want us to repeat the mistakes of the past, especially those that we were able to attribute to the IMF which, 10 or so years ago, was applying formulas that were ultimately making things worse. Furthermore, I strongly disagree with my fellow Member, Mr Gauzès, when he recommends not carrying out nit-picking checks but waiting for the next request to examine the quality of aid spending. No! It is when the aid is committed that one can define the conditions, and I feel that Europe has paid enough of a price for not examining the conditionality of aid in many areas to close its eyes in this case.
I am always sensitive to the imposition of too many conditions and excessive red tape on recipients of assistance, and that goes for Member States right down to SMEs and individuals. However, when that imposition would help to realise a core EU principle such as social inclusion, then it is indeed important. We cannot aspire to a social inclusion process and produce lots and lots of documents outlining how to achieve it if, at the same time, we do not ensure that this process is mainstreamed in our initiatives.
This is why, in our view, we have to reverse the criteria of this conditionality and decide that European public funds or IMF funds can be conditioned, can be combined with a new system of appropriations and will be granted in accordance with new criteria aimed at and encouraging a new distribution of wealth so as to increase pay, pensions and minimum social requirements and to maintain a high level of social protection, the guarantee of a job for all. Ultimately, it is social progress that goes hand in hand with economic efficiency, not the other way round.
(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Commission has shown clear and cooperative understanding to those Member States that have encountered fiscal difficulties because of the crisis. Stable, strong social support systems cannot be maintained if the Member States do not have strong economies. My fellow Members are proposing to restrict the conditions for offering financial support, but I consider this to be undesirable in principle. Instead, we should give serious consideration to the possibility of extending the conditions under which financial support may be obtained, allowing it to be used not only to reinforce states' budgets and financial systems, but also for the development of the economy.
Investment in the economy is necessary in order to guarantee a stable social support system in the long term. The use of financial aid resources in this way too would be the best way in which to provide help as quickly as possible to Member States encountering financial difficulties. The recovery of states from the crisis and their further stabilisation is closely linked with European Union policy in relation to those states. Only harmonised and effective action will produce results on an EU-wide scale. Financial aid is not, and cannot be, the only way in which European states can support each other. Complex solutions must be found that will foster the economic development of all the European Union Member States.
(HU) The countries which we are talking about in this case are the European Union's new Member States which have had, following the changes of regime, to look after those who lost out from the change of regime, become more competitive after economic restructuring in an open market, as well as create and build economies with balanced structures. People have the smallest reserves then in these countries. It means that they are finding it difficult to repay home loans due to the high currency-based debt ratio. Unemployment is rising due to economic problems developing unilaterally and social expenditure is also decreasing.
Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament. In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU. On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request. It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail. As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests.
Those countries which have received financial assistance certainly have many social problems, and we can discuss what type of social conditionality could be included in these financial assistance agreements. If we present the problem in this manner, we must bear in mind that there are insurance and social assistance systems in these countries which have contributed to the imbalances that required the financial assistance for the balance of payments. This is why if we are discussing social conditionality, we must also discuss the reforms which need to be made to these social sectors, primarily the pensions scheme, so that we can achieve medium and long-term financial sustainability, which will help radically resolve the problems in these countries.
Thousands of people in Europe are losing, from one day to the next, the source of their own and their families' livelihood. Do the governments of Member States in any way take into account the social factor when requesting financial aid? This may seem doubtful, when looking at the worsening conditions under which many people are having to live, and the rising unemployment in many European countries. Therefore, I would like to make an appeal that we do not remain indifferent to the needs of ordinary people who, as usual, suffer most acutely from the negative effects of mistakes of those in government.
Mr President, firstly I would like to say that I fully agree with the conditions approved by the European Parliament; that is what the Commission is doing: when it lends money to those three Member States making use of the balance of payments facility, what the Commission does is to take money lent by the markets, and to lend it subject to exactly the same conditions - which are conditions much more favourable for those countries than they could obtain if they went to the market directly to borrow - and to lay down some conditions to ensure that they pay us back the money, but we take into account the four conditions that you mentioned and which this Parliament adopted. We are fully in agreement with them.
Latvia's problem, which is the same problem as Hungary and Romania experienced, is that it has to have recourse to this balance of payments facility because it cannot have recourse to the markets to borrow in order to finance its financial requirements. That is the problem. We are not talking about a programme for a specific activity or for some specific programmes; we are talking about some countries that have a financial difficulty. In part, of course, this derives from the crisis, but as a result of past mismanagement, it is much greater than in other countries where conditions are, objectively speaking, similar.
Please do not blame the Commission or the European Parliament or the Council of Ministers for mismanagement by some governments in certain Member States. That is not our responsibility; our responsibility is to try to help solve a financial problem. In part, this financial problem is a balance of payments problem that has to do with the indebtedness of the private sector, which has to refinance certain amounts or pay back certain debts and does not have the ability to finance itself to carry out these transactions and, in part, at times, it is a public sector need.
In the case of public sector need, to finance its public debt, there is more scope to impose specific conditions, and we do impose them, believe me. The day before yesterday, here in Brussels, I was still trying to convince a representative of Latvia's Government to make the measures to be included in the budget for 2010 more progressive. However, please do not ask the Commission to compel a country to adopt a tax reform which that country does not wish to adopt; for better or for worse, and you know this as well as I do. We do not have that ability.
What is our alternative, then, as representatives of European citizens? To leave the country to collapse into insolvency? To default on its external commitments, whether these are public or private debts? For these financial problems to force the country to devalue its currency by 25 or 30%, which would immediately impoverish families, businesses and the public sector, with debts in foreign currency? I am sure that you do not want that, and nor do I. These are the conditions within which we are working.
I share all your analyses: those of Mr De Rossa, those of Mr Cercas, those of Mrs Berès, all of you; of course I share them. The situation on the ground in a country such as Latvia or Romania, however, at the moment, is more complicated than that. Please, put yourselves in the place of someone who has to act in the name of all of you to decide whether or not to lend to a country that cannot borrow on the markets, as the majority of the Member States can, or as the most industrialised countries can. That is the situation. That is what we are trying to resolve, while meeting the four conditions that you have imposed and which I endorse.
The global financial crisis has had a deep, global effect on the movement of people across the world. Against this backdrop, greater political and social integration is required, with a stronger and more unified Europe. The European Union has to guarantee protection of all fundamental rights within it its own area, otherwise it cannot preach a policy that it does not practise. I am therefore in favour of a new concept of solidarity in the European Union, which can guarantee the minimum social rights for every European citizen. For example, minimum standards are required in the areas of health, education and state pensions and benefits, which should be guaranteed at European level. I believe it is vital to establish these minimum standards since they promote greater uniformity of working conditions, which has a regulating effect on the movement of businesses and labour. Clearly, EU financial support cannot, on the one hand, be subject to policies that are the exclusive responsibility of the Member States, nor, on the other, can it subject these same policies to conditions. This does not mean, however, that better political and social coordination is not required. On the contrary, this integration is vital.
The financial crisis has obliged some Member States to call on assistance from the EU (Council Regulation No 332/2002(1) of 18 February 2002) and from the international community (International Monetary Fund). This support must be geared towards both ensuring that appropriate conditions exist for providing social protection and inclusion and implementing a framework conducive to economic development and the creation of new jobs. In the period between March 2008 and May 2009, the rate of unemployment in the EU27 reached 8.9%, with the number of unemployed rising from 5.4 million to 21.5 million. Job losses are the main concern of European citizens. The European Union and its Member States must be able to retain existing jobs and create other new jobs. This can be done through effective investments in agriculture, education and health, as well as in the transport and energy infrastructure. For every European citizen who loses his or her job, this represents a European family with a lower income and, by extension, a drop in their quality of life. Every job created means a family with a decent living and good-quality education for the younger generation. The success of the European model is measured by the quality of life of Europe's 500 million citizens.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am happy to have the opportunity today to address you in plenary session on the proposal for a regulation on origin marking. This is a proposal which honourable Members may recall the Parliament has been a strong supporter of since its adoption by the College as long ago as December 2005. I particularly recall your resolution of July 2006 and the written declaration of September 2007. I was privileged to discuss this issue last month in Strasbourg with a group of MEPs who stressed to me the need to move rapidly to adopt this regulation.
Origin marking, I might add, is fully in line with the current WTO rules and principles and something that exists almost everywhere in the world. Imports into the United States, into Canada, China and Japan are subject to country of origin marking. As a matter of fact, most products that you can currently purchase in shops in the European Union already bear the country of origin mark, as most legal systems currently require it. This means, of course, that for the vast majority of businesses, an obligation to mark products exported to the European Union will entail no additional cost.
As the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, for many years, our main competitors and economic partners have had origin marking for goods that enter their territory. However, the European Union, in spite of the 2005 proposal for a regulation, which was broadly supported by consumers, by categories of civil society, still lacks a definition, in spite of the favourable opinion expressed many times by Parliament. The lack of a regulation on the designation of origin of goods undermines the right of citizens and consumers and prevents the proper functioning of the market, which, to be free, must have common and shared rules.
The Article 133 Committee has examined in the last few days ideas for reducing the categories of goods included in the regulation, and the grounds for recommending their application for a trial period. We ask the Commissioner: are these compromise proposals endorsed by at least some of the Member States? Will further consideration be given to them? Do you intend to continue to support the 2005 proposal for a regulation, together with Parliament and as part of the codecision procedure? What guarantees and timetables is the Commission offering at the end of this difficult and belated debate? Lastly, Commissioner, while I thank you in any case for what you have done with great energy and determination, can you confirm to me what you wrote in your reply to my question on 5 November 2009, namely that the Commission will continue strongly to support the adoption of the proposal submitted in 2005 and that it will continue to honour its commitment?
We hoped that the initiative that you undertook a few weeks ago to make small changes in order to achieve a compromise could have been supported more strongly, including within the Article 133 Committee. Among other things we regret that, within that committee, many countries reiterated their opposition or misgivings, including the United Kingdom, via its representative. All that we want to do today is to remind you that this request is not about protectionism; it is not industries that are no longer able to compete on the international market that we want to defend, but consumers: we want to draw attention to the theme of health, the environment and genuine reciprocity on the world market, which is lacking today. Moreover, it is not only lacking with regard to the weakest subjects in the world: no, it is also lacking with regard to Japan, to the United States, to Australia, to Canada, to Brazil, to India, to the main competitors of the European Union, which has a duty, in these economically difficult times, to defend the Community interest, which is also behind this request.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, endorsing the comments made by the Members who spoke before me and also espousing the requests made by Mrs Muscardini, I would like to recall an image from a book by Italo Calvino entitled Cosmicomics, in which the big bang is described as an indistinct mass of matter in which nothing is known about anyone or about anyone's origins. At a certain point, a woman says that if she had some room, she could make some pasta and pizza for the people present. This generates great enthusiasm within the mass of matter: there is an explosion, and the desired space materialises as a world made up of differences, which is today's universe.
I believe that, in our global market, we are going backwards, reverting to an indistinct mass of goods, the origin of which and, of course, the characteristics with which they have been made, elude consumers. As liberals and democrats, we are deeply attached to the system and the principle of free trade, but also to that of transparency and the traceability of goods. As has already been said, this is not so much an issue of international trade as an issue of consumer protection. We renew our support for the 2005 proposal and - I repeat - I support the requests made by Mrs Muscardini.
There should be no exceptions for those countries that have entered into a free trade agreement or some other arrangement with the EU; the same rules should apply to everyone. There are those who claim that marking is costly, but many products are already marked, so the additional costs should be minimal. We have already seen this in the more detailed marking of beef in Europe - it is not expensive at all. However, I think that the list could be made longer. It seems to be mostly focussed on products that are often copied and where everyone has an interest in the industry. At the same time, many important consumer products are missing and I think, therefore, that the list should be extended.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are part of an industrial system, at European level, in which the good reputation of goods greatly depends on the integrity of the production system. By keeping at least part of our manufacturing in Europe, we can genuinely offer our consumers controlled, high-quality goods. It is in all of our interests to continue to do so, giving consumers the opportunity of being fully aware of what we are producing and of the origin of the goods produced. In order to meet this objective, we need something very simple but crucial: transparency, a concept that underpins the rules on origin marking, which were already approved by Parliament in 2006 and which, as the Commissioner mentioned earlier, are already largely in use in the main world markets, such as the United States, Mexico and China.
In spite of this, the 'made in' origin mark has still not been approved by some EU Member States. We believe that, if a product is made in China, or in any other non-European country, regardless of its quality - which is also often high - European consumers must be able to know where the product was made so that they can make an informed choice. Some people might interpret the need for transparency as excessive protectionism and believe that all of this may result in increased costs for industry: well, that is absolutely not the case.
However, a text such as this would represent a crucial advance, not only for European consumers, but also for our industries. Indeed, by indicating the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries, consumers would be fully informed of the characteristics of the product they are buying. In such sensitive sectors as clothing, leather goods and furniture, creating the conditions for consumers to make an informed choice is a major issue for those companies that have taken the decision to maintain production in Europe, preserving European knowledge and European jobs.
While globalisation creates the conditions for everyone to be able to produce, the frantic quest solely for profit means that the rights of workers and populations are constantly being infringed, and their environment is being destroyed. Copying, which used to concern only luxury brands, now affects sectors as diverse as the pharmaceutical, car and aeronautical sectors, with the notion of profit always in the background, whereas consumer safety is being seriously undermined. At the same time, tens of thousands of jobs are disappearing.
Let us start, therefore, with the first one that is claimed time and again, namely that consumers are asking for this, and here the advocates claim to be supported by the Commission's Internet consultation in this regard. However, they neglect to mention that 96.7% of the responses to the consultation came from a single country, namely Italy, where industry and organised special interest groups are the driving force on this issue. Today, it is possible for anyone who so wishes to origin-mark his or her goods, and, believe me, any competitive company that can envisage gaining customers in this way will already be doing this, so it is not needed.
Frequently on Italian state-run television channels, investigative documentaries are broadcast showing how, in some countries far removed - including culturally - from Europe, the production techniques are based on the use of highly polluting goods, of polluting techniques, of toxic solvents, with the workforce, including children, being exploited and made to work ridiculous hours. Consumers must be put in a position where they can also choose, having a clear idea of where particular products come from. This is what we are asking for. I believe that the time has come to adopt, clearly and immediately, rules that will put consumers in a position to choose through absolutely clear and transparent mechanisms, and to adopt them with a great deal of determination and much more quickly than has been the case so far.
If I might begin with Ms Muscardini's particular points - the feeling that this has dragged on for some time. In my time as a Commissioner, I have been very conscious of talking with Member States about the issues that they are most concerned with and have tried to react when I could see an issue of importance. But, as other Members have said, the reality of political life is that I have to get any proposal through the Council. That means - when it is clear that there is not a solid majority for a particular idea - thinking again about what it is that might make the difference between failing to get something through, where clearly there is a very strong set of views, and success.
A number of honourable Members have raised the particular issues about consumers and the opportunity that this would afford for transparency and clarity - to give information to consumers. I think even Adam Smith was quoted in that. It is important that, if you are going to have free trade in the world, you also have to have clarity and transparency for consumers to make the kinds of choices that go alongside free trade. Those concepts go hand in hand, and I would agree with that. Therefore, I think that those honourable Members who raised that point actually get to the heart of what this is trying to do.
It is not about protectionism. This happens all over the world. For most of the countries from which one would buy the kind of products we have listed, you already know where you buy from. As a consumer myself, it matters to me to know where the product is made. I think for many consumers this has been an important part of the way in which they interact with the market. The opportunity to say that we will make sure that we have that transparency, I would argue, is very important. We should not be frightened of it, because, if we are frightened of it, there is something wrong. The point about openness and free trade and transparency is that you face that and actually deal with it appropriately.
I think that it is only right that I also address the concerns that have been raised about whether we are being ambitious enough. Mr Arif said that we should not water this down. Of course - but I am not trying to water down; I am trying to be realistic. If, in the end, I have a proposal that I simply do not have the capacity to put through the Council, I think it is beholden on me to look again and ask whether there are there things we could do, not to water down but to recognise the legitimate concerns and see whether we can put this through, perhaps in a pilot model or a more narrow model in order to test that what I say is true and in order that we can then hopefully broaden out later, because we have actually got an understanding of what it is we are trying to do.
We are looking at the whole Euromed issues as well. That is part of the discussion, as you know, that is currently going on. I also take the point about what we are trying to do in terms of protection of jobs. Honourable Members will know that I have made much about the difference between protectionism and support for industry, support for jobs and consumers and so on. We have got to be clear that trade is not about ignoring all of those things. They go hand in hand.
Mr Fjellner, I have got to deal with your particular point, because you described what I was doing as an improper way of acting. I am not quite sure how parliamentary it is in the European Parliament to describe somebody as behaving improperly, but let me assure that I am not seeking in any way to do that. It is not about any link to anything. What I tried to do while I was talking to Member States about all of these aspects of trade was to pick up, either by the work I had been doing - and specifically, talking to small businesses across Europe, where I have a great concern that they should have real opportunities so that more than 3% of them will start trading beyond the European Union - issues that are either left over - things that we have not resolved one way or the other - or indeed where countries feel particularly strongly.
One of the consequences of the liberalisation of world trade is heavy job losses and a worsening of the social situation in a number of regions and countries, including Portugal, which are more dependent on certain productive sectors, such as the textile and clothing sector, for example. In the current climate of severe economic and social crisis, this situation requires a different approach. Adopting rules on designation of origin could help raise the profile of production in various Member States. However, much more is required. We need to protect productive sectors by means of a package of broader and more effective measures, including: implementation of protection and safeguard mechanisms against aggressive exports, prioritising local production; abandoning the model based on low pay, low qualifications and job insecurity; putting public instruments in place to control production and regulate markets, so as to uphold the principle of food sovereignty and security; effectively tackling company relocations. Defending each country's right to sustainable production is a future requirement. We need to do this in the name of a new economic, social, energy and environmental rationality, which the neoliberal model not only does not guarantee but, in fact, makes impossible.
With regard to these transitional rules, my group takes the view that we will all have to make an additional effort, but the future President of the Council will, in particular, play a very important role, especially in maintaining the current 'gentlemen's agreement' in force. It is possible that the Council will be tempted to try to act so as to favour itself for very urgent budget matters, such as the European External Action Service, but, clearly, the three institutions will be on an equal footing and, on Parliament's part, what there will be is a significant sense of responsibility.
Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon will bring big changes, not least in the area of the budget. As many people have pointed out, the most important change is that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure areas will disappear. The European Parliament will therefore have the power of codecision on the whole budget, and we will have a new, simplified budgetary procedure. The treaty is now ready and approved, but that does not mean that we can go over to the new procedure straight away.
Mr President, I, too, would like to start by saying how pleased I am that we now have the Treaty of Lisbon in place, a treaty which will, of course, give Parliament more power over the budget and change the way we adopt the EU's annual budget. We are in a transitional phase, in which the budget for 2010 is being adopted under the old treaty but the implementation of the budget will be monitored and followed up under the new treaty. However we resolve this in practice, we have made a start with Mr Lamassoure's report, and I would like to thank him for taking the initiative so quickly. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wholeheartedly supports the report, which indicates how we are to deal with the amending budgets and transfers and other things that have already been mentioned.
The Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has tabled a number of amendments proposing the abolition of the amending budgets and transfers. I can tell you that the ALDE Group will be voting against all of the EFD Group's proposals. We agree with Mr Lamassoure that the number of amending budgets should be reduced. However, unexpected things do happen during the course of a year and we therefore need an instrument like this. Moreover, national parliaments also have such an instrument. It is possible to make changes during the year. The increasing number of requests for money from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in connection with the large number of dismissals alone will, of course, result in a number of amending budgets. We should not do away with the possibility of transfers between accounts, either. There are very fixed rules for how much the Commission can transfer and how it is to be done - it cannot simply be done however the Commission fancies. It must ask Parliament and the Council first.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to state that we explicitly support the mandate for the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Alain Lamassoure. We are sure that he will lead the negotiations in the transitional period in which we currently find ourselves very well and with great self-assurance. We know that, in the transition from the applicability of the Treaty of Nice to the Treaty of Lisbon - which we were all awaiting and which we need in order to make Europe more democratic and transparent - we need clear rules.
I would like to remind you that it is absolutely necessary, when it comes to the new budgets over the next few years, for the European budget to be created jointly by the Member States and the European Parliament with a real European spirit. Only then can we make the European Union fit for the future. I would also like to remind you, in relation to financial regulations, and specifically in relation to how the money is actually dispersed to and within the Member States, that this must, of course, take place in a way that is secure against abuse. There must not be any scandals or fraud, but the financial regulations must also be made simpler and more transparent so that our European programmes do not create local nuisance, but actually reach the people. That is how we should formulate our European budgetary policy over the next few years.
Billions are being spent on pet subjects of the left, such as the climate and development aid, whilst in the Netherlands, people are failing to receive treatment in care homes, the qualifying age for the state old-age pension (AOW) is being raised to 67 years and the police force is having to make cutbacks. Mr President, this Parliament should be there for citizens, but instead is just realising its own politically correct, extravagant schemes and those of its elitist chums.
We want to introduce transitional procedural regulations in order to safeguard the budget process. I believe that Mr Lamassoure, the rapporteur and chairman of the committee, has mentioned and wants to see implemented principles which will last at least as long as the temporary huts in operation for 90 years I just mentioned. It is extremely important that we have paid a high price for the Treaty of Lisbon. We have given up certain principles, and the citizens of one country, the Czech Republic, will benefit less from human rights than the majority of Europeans. It is our fundamental duty to implement smoothly, seamlessly and efficiently this treaty which we have paid so dearly for. In my view, the proposals which the rapporteur is now asking for authorisation to implement serve this purpose more than adequately. This is why my group would like a significant majority in Parliament to accept them without any changes.
I have just arrived in this Parliament, and clearly I had no experience in relation to the European budget but, honestly, what I have been able to read of the new budget provisions does not incline me to share this optimism. The procedure is going to be complex and, depending on the extent of agreement or, more likely, lack of agreement between Parliament and the Council, it is going to be complicated. However, we will not know this for sure until some budget procedures have been conducted under the new rules.
What we can know right away is the Council's state of mind and, on that point, the truth is that I am not too optimistic, because I can see the Council trying to corner as much power as possible in order to be able to block any decision that goes against the orthodox line. That is to say, it wants to be able to block any decision that is directed towards spending one euro more than planned, no matter what happens. If this is the case, if it wishes to retain all control, I believe that the Council is making a big mistake, because what the Council needs is to have a strong Parliament that it can work alongside.
(FI) Mr President, I support the well-argued proposals put forward by my colleague, Mrs Andreasen. In this report, you welcome the existence of the Treaty of Lisbon. That is your right, but for my part, I will say again that I am sad to see our sovereignty being crushed. You won, but we will be here and we will be on your conscience, because the way the Treaty of Lisbon was pushed through was not right. The matter of sovereignty will never die. The report mentions that several amendments to the law will need to be made so that this financial constitution - that is what it says - can be brought into effect. So you have admitted it. It is thus a constitution: financially, politically and legally. We were right and our struggle for sovereignty will continue here.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome - personally, as well as in my function as the rapporteur for multiannual financial planning - the report by the chairman of our committee, Mr Lamassoure, as it builds the necessary bridges, including in terms of legal certainty, that we need until we have agreed on the necessary adaptation of the interinstitutional agreement and on further technical procedures that we need to clear up under treaty law. I want to spell out the fact that this decision also clarifies that, for us, the entire package will remain as it is for future negotiations - from the question of adapting the interinstitutional agreement to the issue of how we will interact with the future External Action Service, for example, in purely budgetary terms.
In the light of the existing agreement, I also think it is right that the relevant evaluation of the functioning of the existing interinstitutional agreement - I would say technically as well as from a budgetary policy point of view - should properly be integrated into this process of the overall package to implement the Treaty of Lisbon. This, moreover, does not just mean the issue of technicalities and procedures, but also the examination of necessary flexibilities and leeway within the budget, if we honestly intend to implement the Treaty of Lisbon in the budgetary policy sphere.
(CS) Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks to Mr Lamassoure for the report he has written. In my opinion, this document is necessary and it was written with appropriate speed. We know that the Treaty of Lisbon will actually enter into force from December this year and we definitely need this report. I would like to respond to some of the speeches addressing the validity of the Lisbon Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty is now in force and it does not make sense to discuss it further. I would also like to talk about one comment made by László Surján. I would like to give my word to Mr Surján on behalf of the Czech Republic that the Czech Social Democrats will do everything possible to ensure that the exception demanded by President Klaus is withdrawn on behalf of the Czech Republic, as we consider it outrageous.
(HU) The European Conservatives and Reformists Group also happily endorses the transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters, but with the fairly significant addition that we too would not want the transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters to become permanent. On the other hand, we think that a transition between two different systems is necessary so that transitional procedural guidelines need to be drafted. This does not necessarily leave the process open to the danger of superfluous reallocations. In fact, we must avoid the situation in the future where reallocations are made every week and every month. This is why it must be stipulated in the permanent guidelines that such reallocations cannot be made any more than twice a year so that we can preserve the budget's unity, stability and transparency.
I should like to thank all of the spokespersons from the groups that support the main proposals of the report and to assure all of the groups that we will continue, with the European Commission and with the Council, to work towards the successful conclusion of these negotiations, adopting the same team spirit. I believe that the debate has shown us that there was a very large majority in favour of these principles. Mrs Andreasen - who is no longer here - tabled a number of amendments, which we cannot go over because we are in a hurry.
Firstly, may I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, completed in a very short space of time. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is an important step in the unification of the European Union, in strengthening its institutions, and in deepening our European identity. At the same time, the Treaty of Lisbon introduces important changes in the procedure for approving the Community budget. Bearing in mind the idiosyncrasies of the budgetary procedure, we must secure approval of transitional guidelines during forthcoming meetings with the Council, pending approval of the legal texts provided for in the new treaty. These transitional provisions must safeguard equal treatment of the institutions - especially Parliament - in accordance with the new competences which it will acquire under the new treaty. However, in addition to securing approval of transitional provisions, our priority should be the immediate proposal and subsequent approval of the regulation which includes both the Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union and the Financial Regulation. The European Commission's proposals for both these texts should be submitted as a package which is subject to joint negotiation with the Council.
(ES) Mr President, with regard to the Fajon report, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to point out that, although we voted for the report, we do not agree with recital 2a, added by Amendment 4, which states that the Commission 'should start a visa dialogue with Kosovo with a view to establishing a roadmap for visa facilitation and liberalisation similar to those established with Western Balkan countries'.
Mr President, I just wanted to say that we should stress that the joint declaration is really a great success. It is in the joint declaration that we carry the strong political message in support of speeding up the granting of free visas to all the people of the Western Balkans. It is thanks to the responsible position of the PPE Group, which brought the process back on track and in the right direction on a sound legal basis according to the Treaties, that we could achieve such a political success. Forcing into a legal annex a political statement was just misleading and sent the wrong message, raising false expectations for the people in the region.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to talk about Mrs Paliadeli's report, specifically because I believe that the European Ombudsman must actually represent the citizens of the European Union. Over the last year, the Ombudsman has undertaken something that completely contradicts this remit as he has prostrated himself before economic interests and has allowed himself to be used by them. He has put a question to the Commission in which he complains that several States have declared prohibitions on wild animals in circuses. For me, that is not the Ombudsman's concern. It is not the Ombudsman's job to protect a small number of circus owners who still work with wild animals and to fail to side with the great majority of people, who very likely support this prohibition on wild animals and are quite happy with circuses without wild animals.
(HU) The European Ombudsman's report does not reflect the experiences that I have had as a human rights lawyer in Hungary. It does not mention that in autumn 2006, the police, orchestrated by the government, injured, imprisoned and subjected to sham criminal proceedings several hundred peaceful pedestrians and demonstrators commemorating a special event. The EU has remained silent. It is also saying nothing about the fact that since then, the police have been regularly, and illegally, checking the papers of those demonstrating for change, as well as recording them on video, illegally harassing them and often arbitrarily arresting them.
Integration is a splendid measure for preserving peace and that measure can be used for the countries of the Western Balkans. It is important to move forward, to create more favourable conditions to simplify the visa regime. The countries have an opportunity to develop closer ties with neighbouring countries and with the European Union. The liberalisation of the visa regime is based on a regional strategy and European perspective without discriminating against all of the countries of the Western Balkans. The same criteria that were set out in the visa regime liberalisation action plans should be applied to all the countries concerned. There remains the unsolved question of Kosovo and Albania. When will the citizens of these countries be able to take advantage of the visa free regime? I agree that an action plan should be drafted and that urgent talks should begin as soon as possible. Albania and Bosnia have to catch up with Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. The visa requirements should be abolished immediately, as soon as Albania and Bosnia meet all the necessary requirements.
Five Western Balkan countries are negotiating this liberalisation but, according to the Commission report, even though they have all made considerable progress, only three of them (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) meet the conditions for this liberalisation to take place soon, whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are not yet considered ready. I agree that we cannot set precedents by lowering the agreed criteria. We are ready to welcome Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania once they are ready to meet the conditions that have been set.
I generally believe that exemptions from and relaxation of visa rules are positive moves for the coexistence of peoples and for improving cooperation between countries. For the Western Balkans, in particular, it is important that all the countries of the region should be granted such a prospect. I therefore very much welcome the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are to be included in these regulations. Visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the Western Balkans, however. That would be the case if only Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats were able to enjoy exemption from the visa requirement while Bosnian Muslims were not. I also argue in favour of medium-term solutions for Kosovo. In so doing, I would point out that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and does not have any status under international law. That does not relieve us of the obligation to consider how this state and its citizens are to be dealt with in future, however.
I voted in favour of the Fajon report on the liberalisation of visas for the Western Balkans because it is the European Parliament's responsibility to send out a strong message to all of the countries of the Western Balkans that says that we support them in their efforts to meet the criteria laid down by the European Commission in relation to the liberalisation of the visa policy. These criteria have already been met in the case of Serbia and Montenegro, but it has not yet been possible to give the green light to Albania and Bosnia.
Many young people in these countries feel how young East Germans, on the other side of the Wall, used to feel. However, it is hard to believe today that, just a stone's throw from Slovenia, young people cannot get to know Europe or conceive of a future within the EU. Almost 90% of the criteria laid down by the Commission have thus been met by Bosnia. We must press ahead because the political situation could worsen if a strong message is not sent out. Lastly, a solution really will have to be found with regard to the situation of Kosovo, the only part of the Balkans excluded from this process.
in writing. - Moves to liberalise visa requirements for citizens of the Balkan States are to be welcomed. As the stabilisation and association processes develop with these countries and they move from potential candidate status to full candidate status, it seems appropriate that their citizens should enjoy greater freedom of movement. I fully back the amendment tabled on behalf of my own group. This House has previously called on all EU Member States to recognise Kosovo's independence and Serbia should implement the same measures and controls on its Kosovan border as it does on other internationally recognised borders.
I am not opposed to the liberalisation of visas for the Western Balkan countries. However, I voted against the Fajon report because it is unacceptable to think about the liberalisation of visas with Kosovo while we do not recognise its independence. In terms of international law, Kosovo's independence is an illegal act; therefore, the EU cannot negotiate the liberalisation of visas or any other aspect with a territory that is illegally independent. Voting for the Fajon report means indirectly recognising the independence of Kosovo, and that is not acceptable. In addition, under no circumstances can we accept requirements for biometric data for the issue of visas.
Abolishing the visa requirement for Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia is very much to be welcomed, as the Commission's recommendation follows careful evaluation and the meeting of requirements set. The inclusion of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, however, is something to be rejected. There is a danger that including these countries would open the floodgates to organised criminality, human trafficking and immigration. Kosovo is currently only able to sustain its government with massive EU aid and, for that reason, visa waiver negotiations are pointless at this time. We need to better communicate the basis of these decisions, whilst also making clear to Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina that they still need to make major efforts in order to be ready to join the European club.
Conditions for, and the possibilities of, relaxing visa requirements have been discussed for five Western Balkan States - Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. According to the Commission proposal, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have met the majority of targets and are therefore now to have their requirement for a visa removed. The report we are debating also makes reference to the progress made in Albania and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to a corresponding move for those countries to the positive list of visa-free states in the near future. Given the potential for illegal migration from these countries, as well as alarming radical Islamic tendencies, in particular in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, I am voting against the adoption of this report. Moreover, my home country, Austria, would be particularly affected, given its geographical proximity to the Western Balkans. The visa requirement for the states in question represents a certain check on unwanted immigration and should therefore be retained for the time being.
I am, of course, in favour of facilitating travel for citizens of third countries who want to travel to the EU. This includes citizens of the Balkan States and I would therefore have liked to have supported this report. Unfortunately, a number of amendments requiring biometric data to be included in passports were adopted. This is something that I have always been opposed to, as it constitutes an invasion of privacy and also results in a lack of legal certainty. I therefore abstained in the final vote.
The purpose of the Commission proposal is to create a new European Microfinance Facility for Employment, which will give unemployed people the chance to make a fresh start and will pave the way for some of the most disadvantaged groups in Europe, including young people, to start their own businesses. This facility will extend the range of financial support aimed specifically at new entrepreneurs in the current context of tighter credit. I cannot, however, agree with the Commission's proposal to reallocate part of the budget (EUR 100 million) from Progress - a Community Programme For Employment And Social Solidarity - to the European Microfinance Facility. Reallocating sums from Progress would send out the wrong signal, since Progress targets the most vulnerable social groups. The European Microfinance Facility needs to have a separate budget line.
in writing. - I voted for this resolution opposing the draft proposed by the Commission for the Progress annual plan of work for 2010 because the Commission has clearly overstepped its power. It has attempted to reallocate budgetary resources from the Progress programme to the microfinance facility before the European Parliament has reached a decision. The Commission must respect Parliament's prerogative and wait until all three institutions, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, have reached agreement on the microfinance facility before submitting a draft Progress annual plan of work.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the current global economic downturn, simple financial instruments that are able to fund businesses, especially in underdeveloped regions or for such social groups, assume particular importance. The microcredit system operating in numerous countries and on several continents has also proved that with the provision of appropriate training and monitoring, this system can offer assistance to the most vulnerable groups who are forced to face grave difficulties on the labour market. The Progress Microfinance Facility proposed by the European Commission is an extremely important initiative which may be able to fulfil this role in reintegrating those groups affected by social exclusion. However, until the codecision process between the Commission and the European Parliament is up and running and the budget for the microfinance facility is completely clear, it would be a sensible idea for the European Commission to withdraw its proposal concerning the Progress annual plan of work for 2010 and not present the colegislators with a fait accompli. This means that once the codecision process is over, the European Parliament could make a free, responsible decision on this vital issue.
in writing. - I took the decision to support this motion for a resolution as I oppose the suggestion made by the Commission to reduce the financial envelope of the Programme for Employment and Social solidarity - Progress, by EUR 100 million and to reallocate this money to the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion. The Progress programme has now been running for three years and the overall impact has been positive. I welcome the proposal establishing the microfinance facility as I believe it will help offer a new start for some of Europe's most disadvantaged groups by increasing the supply and accessibility of microloans and, in turn, helping people start up their own businesses. However, I do not think that the Progress programme should be jeopardised by the reallocation of funds to the microfinance facility. I would like to see the full implementation of both programmes and it is for this reason I voted in favour of this motion.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Progress annual plan of work for 2010 and list of activities by policy section. I believe that it is important for Parliament, the Council and Commission, first of all, to reach an agreement on the proposal to set up Progress, a European Microfinance Facility for employment and social solidarity, as well as on the proposal to amend the Progress Community Programme. According to these, EUR 100 million should be reallocated to finance Progress, the new European Microfinance Facility supporting employment and social solidarity in order to implement the 'shared commitment for employment' mentioned in Commission communication COM(2009)257. I feel that the sum of EUR 100 million is not sufficient to achieve the objectives being proposed. This is why I voted in favour of the Commission withdrawing the draft decision on the annual plan of work for 2010 as part of the Progress Programme and list of activities by policy section and the future Commission resubmitting a new proposal, after the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force and the European Parliament, Council and Commission have reached an agreement on the proposal submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council and on the amended proposal.
I hope the energy dialogue and the commitments resulting from the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit will, in the long term, lead to greater transparency and viability for the energy sector, and that this sector, in turn, can help to establish new structural relations between the two blocs through the development of commercial and economic cooperation. Equally important is cooperation between the EU and Russia on climate change, so as to secure a global agreement at the Copenhagen conference. I would emphasise the strategic nature of EU-Russia relations and their contribution to the process of mutual understanding and trust, which is essential for establishing peace and stability across the continent of Europe.
I voted in favour of this resolution since I believe that this summit is particularly important, coming as it does just before the Copenhagen climate change conference, and it may be an excellent opportunity to strengthen EU-Russia relations. This partnership can play a decisive role on the world stage, given the effects of the economic and financial crisis, the preparations for Copenhagen, and the signing of a future agreement to set up an early warning system to ensure greater energy security between the EU and Russia, thus promoting further cooperation in this field.
The last 20 years also serve to remind us that Europe's relations with Russia are now different, since they are based on dialogue. Russia is not an ally of Europe with whom we share values; it is a neighbour with whom we share a geographical area, divergences and common interests, such as the situation in Afghanistan. This realism should be the starting point for us to draw up a new cooperation agreement in future. The fall of Communism does not mean the end of differences but, in these relations, it does mean the end of confrontation.
Although the joint motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit makes reference to our important mutual ties and common interests, in certain points, it represents an unacceptable meddling in internal affairs. The motion seeks to forbid Russia from negotiating with individual EU Member States about energy projects. The EU's one-sided view of the conflict in Georgia, where the Union is clearly behind Georgia, is contrary to the EU's role as a fair and independent observer. The overall tone of this motion would not help to improve relations with this important country for Europe. I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution.
There are certainly deficits in terms of democracy and the rule of law in Russia. Nonetheless, I do not believe that we should be engaging in self-righteous meddling in the internal policy affairs of other States, all the more so given that the EU is by no means in a position to assume the role of a model of democracy. Our one-sided view of the conflict in Georgia, too, is, I think, a mistake. In the light of these considerations I voted against the motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit.
I endorsed the resolution on the EU-Russia Summit, because the forthcoming summit between the European Union and Russia in Stockholm is an opportunity to think through the most important problems of that strategic cooperation. Developing an effective formula for dialogue with the Russian Federation requires a uniform and united policy from the Member States of the European Union. We must remember that a condition of bringing such a concept into reality has to be that we rise above the interests of particular Member States. The idea of a uniform and united policy takes on special significance in the context of the security of European energy policy. In this matter, the common interest of the European Union must stand above efforts to look after private interests in relations with Russia.
A further, important matter for relations between the European Union and Russia is the question of the Eastern Partnership. Russia should understand that this project is not directed against Russia. Developing a strategy to ensure stabilisation and development in the region is advantageous both for the countries of the EU and for Russia. An important challenge for bilateral relations is also the criteria for evaluation of the problem of the observance of human rights and the principles of the rule of law in Russia. The countries of the EU should ask themselves if, in a strictly European sense, it is possible to recognise some of Russia's actions as fully democratic.
Negotiations, which began last year, are currently underway with Russia. These negotiations concern a new EU-Russia treaty, and take account of the current Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Russian Federation, of the other part. Parliament has always stressed the significance of questions such as human rights, energy security and minority rights, and so this time too, these matters cannot fail to be raised at the summit. Good relations with Russia are very important to the European Union, because it is an important and valuable partner in European relations, but under no circumstances can it be allowed that the EU should not raise questions which are uncomfortable for the Russian Federation. Particularly worthy of note is Amendment 3 to the EU-Russia Summit in the Stockholm resolution, adopted by the European Parliament, which adds a new Paragraph 9a to the resolution: 'Stresses that developing infrastructure links between the EU and the Russian Federation is mutually beneficial and therefore should be encouraged and based on minimising economic and environmental costs; strongly encourages Russia to adhere, in energy cooperation projects with the EU, to the fundamental principles formulated in the Energy Charter'.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution because of the importance of tackling Alzheimer's disease in Europe. As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am used to investing time and effort in an issue now in order to benefit future generations. As Europe's population becomes older, Alzheimer's disease is set to become more prevalent across the EU. As such, it is crucial that the European Parliament tackle this problem now to try and offset some of the damage that this rise in Alzheimer's will cause.
in writing. - I wholeheartedly support the resolution on neurodegenerative diseases and welcome the EU's proposed coordination in this area. Dementia is a huge issue throughout Europe affecting millions of individuals and families. There are an estimated seven million people across the EU with dementia, some 70 000 in Scotland - and these figures are expected to rise in the future. The Commission has expressly recognised Scotland as one of a handful of countries to have already embarked upon a national dementia strategy. The work already undertaken in Scotland will fit nicely into the proposals of the EU and together, we will be more able to better understand and help prevent Alzheimer's and other degenerative conditions.
I voted in favour of the resolution on the joint programming of research to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's, because I feel it is important to speed up the joint research work carried out by the Member States in relation to neurodegenerative diseases. It should not be forgotten that around 7.3 million people in Europe suffer from Alzheimer's disease or from a similar disease; this figure is expected to double by 2020. Unfortunately, no cure exists at the moment, and prevention- and treatment-related knowledge is limited. That is why I recommend that the Member States pool their resources and their efforts in order to further the research together, since by working together as Europeans, we will be in a stronger position to combat these diseases. Moreover, I call on the European ministers for research to adopt a similar position on 3 December. I should also like to point out that MEPs, now more than ever, want to be involved in future initiatives concerning the joint programming of research, through the legislative procedure laid down by the Treaty of Lisbon for research, namely codecision.
Around 7 million people in Europe suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. Given Europe's increasingly aged population, this figure is likely to double over the next few decades. What is more, it is a sad truth that, in the field of neurodegenerative conditions, at present the available treatment methods only slow down the progress of the illness, rather than aiming to prevent or actually cure the illness. Dementia and related conditions, and in particular Alzheimer's disease, give rise to enormous health care expenditure: the annual costs for dementia patients are estimated to amount to around EUR 21 000. Additional costs also arise as a result of the associated problems for these conditions, as patients tend not to get additional physical complaints looked at and often have a self-denying reaction to medical treatment. Europe is facing a major health policy challenge here, where the exchange of knowledge and best practice in procedures and methods as part of a common, pan-European research framework is certainly a worthwhile approach. I therefore support the motion for a resolution.
The number of complaints registered in 2008, considered inadmissible, is extremely high and is on the rise compared with previous years. This is why I think that proper, continuous, dynamic information campaigns need to be run in every Member State. As European citizens do not know the best person to contact when their rights are breached, they very often contact the European Ombudsman without good reason. However, the European Ombudsman can resolve only the cases of maladministration involving the work of the European Union's institutions. Cooperation between the European Ombudsman and EU institutions must be improved.
The European Mediator has played a key role in increasing transparency and responsibility as part of the European Union's decision-making process and administrative system. I sincerely hope that the 44 inquiries closed with critical remarks in 2008 will lead, in the future, to a reduction in the number of maladministration cases. I am in favour of a broad interpretation of the term 'maladministration', which needs to include unlawful administrative acts or infringements of binding legal rules or principles, as well as cases where the administrative authorities have been sloppy, negligent or lacking in transparency in their duty to citizens or have infringed other principles of good administration.
I voted for the Paliadeli report on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities because I believe that the Ombudsman has carried out his duties in an active and balanced manner, in terms of examining and managing complaints, conducting and concluding investigations, maintaining constructive relations with the institutions and bodies of the European Union and raising citizens' awareness regarding their rights in respect of those institutions and bodies. It is worth highlighting the good level of cooperation between the European Ombudsman and other European bodies, particularly the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions. For this reason, by voting for the report, we wanted to give him our backing in his role as an external control mechanism and as a valuable source of proposals for improvements to European administration.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2008, which emphasises the growing number of complaints concerning the EU's lack of transparency. This data worries me. I therefore support this resolution, which calls for the Ombudsman's activities to be given a higher profile. Indeed, it is regrettable that 36% of the 355 inquiries completed by the Ombudsman in 2008 concern the lack of transparency of the European institutions, and include cases in which requests for information were refused. I feel it is important to point out that responsible and transparent administration of the European Union is a guarantee of the trust that the citizens place in the European Union.
I fully endorse the resolution of the European Parliament on the annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2008, and voted in favour of its adoption. The proposal to set up a joint website for the European institutions is especially valuable. This would allow interested parties to find the right institution for each matter and to direct letters, questions and complaints to the appropriate address. This would be an invaluable aid to the citizens of EU Member States. At the moment, most people have problems with this. People have approached me many times with a request for information about where they can gain access to documents or lodge a complaint, because they do not know to whom to turn. They send letters everywhere, and then are embittered by the lack of replies and disillusioned with the functioning of the EU institutions, including the lengthiness of administrative procedures. On the other hand, the Ombudsman, instead of replying to the appropriate complaints, has to grapple with the more than 75% of complaints which are not within his area of competence. The new website would be an excellent guide to the areas of competence of the European institutions. Until it is set up, I would ask the European Ombudsman to pass on each complaint directly to the national or regional ombudsman with the appropriate competence. I also support the idea of running a broader information campaign with the objective of raising citizens' awareness of the functions and areas of competence of the members of the European ombudsman network.
Given that the following months are crucial to the European Union's budgetary policy and that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, budgetary transfers or reviews will follow up until the start of 2010, a clear-cut procedure must be established for this transitional period to facilitate the implementation of the budget and the adoption of amending budgets. As part of the budgetary conciliation procedure scheduled for 19 November, the European Commission, European Union Council and European Parliament must reach an agreement on adopting transitional guidelines. The European Parliament's delegation must adopt a strong, solid position as part of the negotiations. This is why I voted in favour of Mr Lamassoure's report.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will change the current budgetary framework of the EU and result in a need to adopt legal acts to implement it. These include, in particular, adoption of the new regulation on the multiannual financial framework and of the financial regulation on the new principles on how to adopt and implement the budget, and approval of the new interinstitutional agreement. As the whole procedure of adopting these new measures will take several months, I agree with the rapporteur that transitional guidelines are needed, which should come in together with the entry into force of the treaty.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his proactive approach and the quality of the work carried out. I would stress that the transitional measures must not stray from the general principles laid down in the new treaty, nor must they jeopardise any future legislative procedures. I must also point to the need to cut down on the current number of amending budgets, which has been excessive, and urge the Commission to table proposals for the adoption of a regulation containing the multiannual financial framework and for the adaptation of the financial regulation.
The report focuses on transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters in view of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. Of course, because of the changes introduced into budgetary procedure, the entry into force of the treaty - to which we have been and remain opposed - requires the adoption of these transitional measures, given that the European Union budget for 2010 will still be approved within the framework provided by the Treaty of Nice. The subject of this report, therefore, is not the Treaty of Lisbon itself, but the need to adopt a procedure that makes it possible to implement the budget for 2010.
Since we are aware of this need, we voted against all the proposed amendments to the report that would end up blocking implementation of the budget, which would be an extremely negative outcome. Nonetheless, we cannot vote in favour of a report that says straight away in paragraph 1: the European Parliament 'welcomes the imminent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon'. Our stance is demanded by the most basic sense of consistency, given that the treaty will have profoundly negative consequences for the future of Europe's workers and citizens, for reasons that we have explained on many occasions, and its ratification process was profoundly undemocratic, hence our decision to abstain in the final overall vote.
This is of particular concern as regards agriculture, which ceases to be a compulsory expense and which will no doubt be sacrificed for the sake of the clientelistic whims of this House. Aside from this fundamental problem, it is unacceptable to crudely engineer the immediate application of the new procedures. In these times of crisis, one cannot 'play' with European taxpayers' money for the sake of politically sensitive issues. We need a financial regulation and an interinstitutional agreement negotiated in the correct form, and too bad if it takes time.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will entail significant changes in many areas, starting with the budgetary procedure. A report ensuring the transition between the two procedures, one currently in use and the other envisaged in the new treaty, is of significant benefit. This is precisely why I have considered it appropriate to support it in its entirety. The procedural guidelines set out in a report will facilitate the budgetary activities of the three institutions involved so that the budget can be implemented efficiently, particularly with regard to budgetary transfers. The request made, on the rapporteur's initiative, to adapt the Financial Regulation to the new rules in the Treaty of Lisbon in the shortest possible time is another measure which is an immediate necessity. Furthermore, we will expect the adoption of the transitional guidelines considered during the budgetary conciliation meeting set for 19 November, prior to the Council's second reading, confident that they will be given due importance.
If you consider the excessive number of amending budgets, you could get the impression that the EU is incapable of planning. Clearly, that view would not be completely mistaken. You only need think of the tighter and tighter network of EU agencies with its constantly growing budget and the associated potential overlaps of competence and duplications of work. This also applies to the new External Action Service to be created under the Treaty of Lisbon, for which it is necessary to shape the EU budget in such a way that the new system, on the one hand, does not result in any duplication, but instead, allows synergies to be exploited, and that, on the other hand, parliamentary control cannot be circumvented, the Member States cannot be blocked and national competences remain un-neutered. This amending budget is premature, given that the Treaty of Lisbon is about to enter into force, as a number of issues still appear unresolved. I have therefore voted 'no'.
I voted in favour of the resolution on the report by my colleague, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure. Indeed, this report calls for the European Parliament's new powers to be respected from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and transitional rules are thus requested for the interim period pending the application of the new budgetary rules provided for by the same treaty. The new treaty makes Parliament equally responsible, with the Council, for adopting the budget, even in respect of 'compulsory' expenditure (agriculture and international agreements), which, until now, was decided on exclusively by the Member States. Parliament's new powers cannot be implemented until new procedural regulations, which are necessary in order to put into practice the general provisions of the new treaty, have been adopted. This report emphasises the fact that this situation is worrying, for I do not want the Council and the Commission to continue with their 'business as usual' approach in the meantime. I therefore call for transitional rules to be adopted without delay, and the next meeting between the Council and Parliament to negotiate the 2010 budget could be an opportunity to adopt them ...
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the Charter of Fundamental Rights relating to people with disabilities within the Treaty of Lisbon. The Council of Europe is currently working on a new draft anti-discrimination regulation and I would like to highlight three aspects. Firstly, according to the charter, no one can be discriminated against directly or indirectly because they have a child or family member with disabilities. Secondly, from now on, insurers cannot refuse to issue insurance because someone has a genetic disorder or disability. Thirdly, the rights promoted by the European Union's institutions and Christian Democracy attach a great deal of importance to respect for the quality of life of people with disabilities. I would like to draw my fellow Members' attention to all these points because I would like to ask you to support the creation of the Disability Intergroup this week.
(PL) Mr President, the European Union, in which one in seven citizens belongs to a national minority, can be proud of its extensive guarantee to respect their rights. The significance of the European Union's motto - unity in diversity - is worth stressing here. All of us in this Chamber know that a true democracy can be recognised by the way it treats its minorities. The Lisbon Treaty unambiguously imposes an obligation to respect the rights of people who belong to minorities, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights forbids any discrimination based on the grounds of ethnic origin or membership of a national minority.
Unfortunately, there are still countries in the EU which, despite their adoption of international legal obligations in this area, are moving towards the assimilation and outright deprivation of the national identity of their minorities by deliberate policy. Lithuania, for it is this country to which I refer, has, for over 20 years, been discriminating against its citizens in different areas of life. Not only has this been done in a planned way but, since its accession to the European Union, these practices have even increased. The ruling of the Lithuanian Constitutional Court on the spelling of Polish surnames only in Lithuanian transcription is an example.
In my short speech, speaking as a member of the European Parliament delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I would like to encourage Turkey to continue the efforts it has undertaken for reform, the objective of which is full democratisation of the country and rapid resolution of conflicts with neighbouring countries. Accession negotiations have reached an advanced stage and require Turkey to make yet greater efforts at meeting the criteria for membership. The perspective of accession to the EU should be an incentive to strengthen democracy and observe human rights, and also to further modernisation of the country and the achievement of European Union standards.
However, at the World Summit on Food Security held on 16 November in Rome, under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the situation was entirely different: snubbed by almost all of the G8 leaders, it did not end in the ratification of the measures previously anticipated. It is therefore hardly surprising that no precise figure appears in the text numbering forty or so articles, not even the USD 44 billion that the FAO says are needed annually in order to sustain the agricultural systems of the poorest countries.
(ES) Mr President, the situation in the Western Sahara is very serious. The alerts from the Human Rights Observatory in Asturias - my region - and from many other organisations deserve to be taken seriously. There are seven prisoners awaiting military trials for having visited their families in Tindouf, there are political prisoners, there is torture, people have disappeared, and a peaceful heroine and candidate for the Sakharov prize, Aminatou Haidar, the Saharan Gandhi, has been expelled by the territory's occupying power. This is something unprecedented in international law.
I will therefore be sure to remind the Commission, when it is represented here, that we need a legal basis for the Baltic Sea Strategy in order for us to actually be able to put it into practice and for the funds that have now been reserved to actually be put to use. As already mentioned, the reports that we have received over the last few weeks indicate that action is urgently required. Various things need to happen - and quickly. I therefore hope that we will all roll up our sleeves and start to actually do something very soon. Action is needed, not only by us, but also on the part of the Commission, the Council and the parties affected.
In the first place, it is unacceptable because it is aligned with neo-liberal policies that exacerbate the current economic and social crisis, especially in agriculture and fishing, but this fact becomes particularly serious when these policies are promoted through an agreement with a country that is violating international law and the most basic rights of the Palestinian people; a country which does not respect its obligations as agreed in the roadmap for peace, keeping Gaza under siege, building more settlements, continuing to build the wall and expelling Palestinians from Jerusalem. This is a country that is continuing to escalate the violation of human rights and international humanitarian laws.
Soviet archival documents state that, in the 1980s, Neil Kinnock, as Leader of the Opposition, approached Mikhail Gorbachev through secret envoys to see how the Kremlin would respond if a Labour Government stopped the implementation of the Trident nuclear missile programme. If the report given to Mr Gorbachev is true, it means that Lord Kinnock approached one of Britain's enemies in order to seek approval regarding his party's defence policy and, if elected, Britain's defence policy.
(HU) It is a sad fact that a policy justifying the collective disenfranchisement of minorities can still provide an obstacle even today to the next wave of the integration process. I would like to thank the President for what he did in order to restore normality in Slovakia. The language law is just one such sad, small chapter. The Czech case was another example. The Czech Head of State must know, even without the Treaty of Lisbon, that the Beneš Decrees came about through the enforcement of the principle of collective guilt and are not made unlawful with the enactment of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; they are, in fact, still in conflict with more than six European documents. We are confident that the future of the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU will be defined not by the rekindling of collective disenfranchisement from the Second World War, but by safeguarding the rights of minorities according to the customary European practice of guaranteeing autonomy in cultural life.
Let me give you just a few examples. There was a recent report in the press about a blatant case of discrimination. The director of an Italian company providing telephone, cable and internet services advised his employees not to sign contracts with Romanian citizens. In another example, a child, who was a Romanian national of Roma ethnic origin, suffered an injury, but none of the hospitals in the city of Messina wanted to admit him. He died on the way to Catania. These are just a few specific incidents. However, Romanians in Italy are facing similar censure almost every day.
Mr President, I was going to speak on the importance of European structural funds for regions like Wales post-2013, but I must respond to the comments made by Mr Batten earlier about a distinguished British politician and former Commissioner in the European Commission. To accuse such a person of treason is, I believe, to say the least, unparliamentary language, and he should be ashamed of himself. I would ask him to withdraw those remarks, and, if he will not, I think you, Mr President, should ask him to do so.
Mr President, soldiers from the United Kingdom and many other European nations are fighting and dying in Afghanistan. We are told that the reasons are to keep our country safe by preventing the return of al-Qaeda, or to protect democracy, or to fight drugs, or to support Pakistan, or to uphold the rights of women. But I am no longer convinced by any of these explanations. There is no clear political strategy, and I do not know what the death of our soldiers is supposed to achieve. Far from bringing us security, I fear our presence is increasing the dangers, allowing us to be portrayed by Islamist extremists as foreign invaders supporting a government of warlords and drug barons in a civil war. Our actions foster the growth of radical, anti-Western Islamic beliefs. We need a diplomatic strategy; we must talk with the Taliban, we must promote reconciliation and seek to broaden the composition of the current government and we must be prepared to withdraw our soldiers from Afghan soil.
(DE) Mr President, one in seven Europeans belongs to an ethnic minority. In spite of this fact, protection for autochthonous minorities in Europe is not seen as a priority. While Brussels never tires of taking all kinds of competences away from the Member States, the Commission, stating that it does not wish to interfere in internal affairs, has declared conflicts between minorities a matter for the states concerned. There is no unified approach in Europe. International law provisions are applied quite differently in different states.
France, for example, does not recognise any ethnic minorities and in Slovenia, the AVNOJ decisions still infringe international law. In Austria, on the other hand, the Slovenian minority enjoys a full range of opportunities for development. In my view, these obvious discrepancies reflect a need for a European law on ethnic groups. If Europe wants to protect the ethnic diversity it has developed throughout history, it is vital to draw up an internationally binding European law on ethnic groups which covers autochthonous minorities. This would be an opportunity for the EU to prove that it pays more than just lip service to the protection of national diversity within Europe.
It appears that the European Solidarity Fund may be too restrictive to deal with this situation. However, I am still hopeful that an application could be considered, but, if not, I suggest that a regional application could be favourably considered, as the north, the west and the south of the country have been affected. Many people in my European constituency, including the counties of Galway, Mayo, Clare, Leitrim and Roscommon, together with the south of Ireland, have been affected by the horrendous flooding that has taken place. I am appealing to the Commission to assist in a pragmatic and urgent manner.
Given that El Salvador is one of the countries most afflicted by economic and social difficulties in Central America, it is imperative that the European Union offers a massive level of support in order to tackle the social chaos caused by this natural disaster. The El Salvadorian Government estimates that, given the country's vulnerability to such natural disasters, more than EUR 1 billion will be necessary for the country to restore what has been damaged and to implement a plan for reconstruction and risk mitigation. For this reason, it is seeking the release of extraordinary funds and the redirection of funds available from the European Union.
(EL) Mr President, allow me to share my fellow members' concern about the disparity between the progress report on Turkey towards integration into the European Union and an article published recently in the Wall Street Journal Europe, which reported that the Prime Minister of Turkey, in a recent visit to Iran, confirmed - and endorsed Iran's views - that Iran's nuclear programme is, in his words, for peaceful and philanthropic purposes only. This disparity is also very evident from the fact that Turkey's overall behaviour - such as on 8-9 November in connection with the visit by the President of Sudan to Istanbul - is creating a serious issue. This being so, I would be very grateful if my fellow members would bear these concerns in mind.
Mr President, the European Union would like to see itself as a democratic union of 27 democratic states, but we have got to look at the reality. In Belgium only a few years ago, the state took steps to ban one of the larger political parties. In Germany, at about the same time, there were unsuccessful attempts to ban a party on the basis of incriminating statements made by state operatives. In Hungary, opposition parties are physically attacked by the state, their members arrested and tortured. In the United Kingdom, a violent militia sponsored by the governing party and the Leader of the Opposition carries out violent and, in some cases, armed attacks on opponents.
(EL) Mr President, in light of the start of negotiations on an agreement for the readmission of illegal immigrants between the European Union and Turkey, I should like to point out that we need a commitment by Turkey that it will cooperate in stamping out illegal immigration. I would remind the House at this point that 76.5% of all arrests of illegal immigrants on the borders of the European Union are on Greece's borders. I know full well that, where third countries have cooperated - examples are Italy and Libya and Spain and Mauritania - there have been tangible results. That is why we need progress with readmission agreements; Turkey needs to cooperate with Frontex, with the Greek authorities, and with the authorities of the European Union.
Today, the French Mistral-type helicopter carrier arrived in St Petersburg. The plan to sell this modern warship to Russia is the equivalent of rewarding the Kremlin for its invasion of Georgia last year. In the words of the commander of the Russian navy, this type of ship would have enabled the Russian navy, in August 2008, to carry out its mission in 40 minutes instead of 26 hours. In that case President Sarkozy would have had no time to prevent Mr Putin occupying the Georgian capital.
Many of these people have lived in Germany for over a decade, having found shelter there from displacement, persecution and violence. People are also beginning to be deported from Austria, Belgium, Hungary and France. I oppose these deportations because the situation of minorities in Kosovo, especially the Roma, is unbearable. The unemployment rate in this group stands at almost 100% and in Kosovo there is no way of providing these people with decent accommodation. Their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted Mitrovica. Finally, I would also like to appeal to the responsibility that Germany has, as a result of its history, to the victims of the Second World War, including the Roma and Sinti who were persecuted and systematically murdered. A certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case ...
As far as illegal migration and cross-border crime are concerned, the forecasts for the coming years indicate that the influx of migrants is set to rise, including at the European Union's eastern border. I am referring in particular to the Republic of Moldova. In the wake of the political changes that have taken place there, this country has clearly expressed the desire to become integrated into the European Union, but is currently in a vulnerable economic position. It also has a reduced capacity to manage issues such as migration and crime at its borders. With a view to strengthening its own external borders and creating a security zone, the European Union must grant the Republic of Moldova considerable economic aid in order to increase its capacity to take action.
The Azerbaijani authorities must release the prisoners of conscience, Adnan Hajizade and Emin Abdullayev, immediately and unconditionally. The Council, the Commission and the Member States of the European Union must raise the issue of democracy and human rights with the Azerbaijani Government. It must be reminded that democratisation is one of the goals of the Eastern Partnership, and Azerbaijan is part of that initiative. Azerbaijan has to live up to its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and partner of the European Union.
(EL) Mr President, the imperialist policy of support for Israel by the USA and NATO and the upgrading of relations and of the issues in general contained in the EU-Israel Association Agreement are strengthening the aggression and intransigence of Israel towards the Palestinian people. According to statistics, this year has been the bloodiest for the Palestinian people. A total of 1 443 Palestinians were murdered during the Israeli army's 'Molten Lead' military operation alone, 9 600 Palestinians are being illegally held without trial in Israeli prisons, the wall of shame is 450 kilometres long, with plans to extend it to 750 kilometres, and houses and infrastructure are being demolished on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. We express our solidarity with the Palestinian people and call for an immediate, just and viable solution to the Palestinian question: the creation of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 territories, with its capital in East Jerusalem, which will have sovereignty over its territory and borders and will make provision for the return of refugees and the return of all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
(HU) I would like to draw your attention to the topic which Cornelia Ernst spoke about earlier. I am talking about the start, following the negotiation and signing of readmission agreements, of the process of resettling those who were displaced or forced to flee during the Yugoslav war. This process has started both on a voluntary basis and under coercion, involving, in particular, the minorities living in Kosovo, primarily the Roma, who are ending up in a very difficult situation as a result of this process.
The next item is Mrs Trautmann's report on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (03677/2009 - -.
This is an opportunity for me to thank my colleagues, particularly my co-rapporteurs Pilar del Castillo and Malcolm Harbour; the chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Vidal-Quadras; the chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Herbert Reul, and all the services of the European Parliament that were involved. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for her involvement and support throughout this period, and I thank her services as well. Finally, I also welcome the efforts of the Swedish Presidency to reach a satisfying conclusion. Let us take a moment to remember Ulrika Barklund Larsson.
Tomorrow's vote will give a very positive signal to those expecting a more dynamic European industrial policy. As the second reading agreement on 99% of the text has been maintained, I shall just summarise the aspects that we made our priority. In particular, we wanted to maintain effective, lasting competition, but also to make that competition useful to economic and social development through complete coverage of European territory in terms of access, high speed internet for all and for all regions - including better management of radio spectrum - and full rights for consumers.
It is important that we remain within the terms of the agreement and, unfortunately, recent statements made by certain Member States raise some doubt over their commitment on this matter. I shall support the Commission's interpretation of the result of our negotiations over Article 19. As a matter of interest, the wording chosen for this article is closely linked to the debate on the mechanisms of Articles 7 and 7a. It would be disappointing if the Council, through non-binding declarations, put across the message that it somehow wanted to have its cake and eat it by denying a fair balance of powers between Member States, BEREC and the Commission, as emerged in the final compromise.
The compromise reached in conciliation lays down for the first time in EU law the fundamental rights of internet users against measures that could limit their internet access. This is a very important internet freedom provision. It makes clear that the internet, which is becoming more and more central to our daily lives, should be subject to the same safeguards for our fundamental rights as other areas of activity. Prior, fair procedures, with the presumption of innocence and the right to privacy, followed by the right to effective and timely judicial review: those are the rules which have been put into the new reform package.
Thanks to Parliament, the new provisions on radio spectrum will bring lower prices and encourage the introduction of new services, thereby helping to bridge the digital divide. Parliament will have a key role in setting the strategic direction for spectrum policy at European level through the new multiannual radio spectrum policy programme. The reforms will also permit investment by operators in the next-generation networks. They will strengthen the incentives to invest efficiently in new infrastructure by taking account of the investment risks, while ensuring that competition is not stifled.
Tomorrow's vote, however, is only the beginning. We shall, both here and in the national parliaments, be keeping an extremely close watch over the way in which the compromise adopted tomorrow is transposed into national legislation, because we know that a number of Member States of the European Union are, shall we say, somewhat heavy-handed when it comes to public freedoms - particularly where the internet is concerned - and I am not sure they will avoid the pitfall of diverging from the rule we will adopt tomorrow.
I welcome the fact that all the political groups represented in the conciliation have endorsed the text and that we can finally unleash the benefits of this whole package with our vote tomorrow, because it has now been some months since we worked on it. The Council had already accepted, on 26 October, my own report on universal service and users' rights, a number of points in which Mrs Reding highlighted. I will not repeat these, but suffice to say, this is a major advance for consumers.
Commissioner, we very much welcome the statement that you have already made on data breach, but I have to say I was somewhat surprised to receive a statement from 13 Member States that seemed to me to rather reinterpret the agreement that they had already signed off on 26 October. You may perhaps wish to comment on that later. I just wish to reinforce the view - and I am sure you would agree, Mr President - that what we have agreed is the position. The Commission will now carry out that position. If it needs clarification, it is down to the Commission to do that. We look forward to it enforcing and moving this out as soon as possible, particularly in the area of net neutrality, your declaration on which is warmly welcomed, because that is something that we fought very strongly for in my committee. This is an important step forward for consumers. I very much welcome it on behalf of my group and, I hope, the whole Parliament.
Mr President, the telecoms package will be decided on tomorrow. I would like to thank Mrs Trautmann and all of my fellow Members who have fought for a free internet. Above all, I would like to thank all of those citizens who have demonstrated their commitment to this issue. They have got very strongly involved, and quite rightly so, as this is ultimately about freedom of expression and our civil rights and freedoms. It was thanks to our committed citizens that the protection of internet users against monitoring and the abuse of power is better than expected, but, in my opinion and that of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, it is not good enough.
The second reason is that my amendments concerning internet rights, in other words, the well-known Citizens' Rights Amendments, were not included in the compromise. This, in fact, opens the way for a network where it is not a foregone conclusion that all users will have access to the whole network and where not all sites have the same possibility of being viewed. I think that we should have been very clear that it must not be permitted to lead the internet down such a blind alley. The end result then runs the risk of being more like a collection of cable television channels rather than free communication for everyone.
I would therefore like to applaud the efforts of the European Parliament's negotiating team, as well as the businesslike and constructive approach taken by the representatives of the Council and the Commission, thanks to whom it was possible to reach agreement on the wording of the contentious provision in such a way that the aims and ideas contained in the original Article 138 were transposed in an acceptable way into the new telecommunications directive. I firmly believe that, following the conciliation procedure, the new telecommunications directive is ready to be applied in European public life.
We have now secured the protection of our citizens to a far greater extent than we had imagined at the start of the process, as things have moved forward. Measures taken in the EU Member States in relation to access or usage of electronic communication network services must not infringe fundamental rights in any way. Limitations should only be introduced after a fair and independent process. The person must have a right to a hearing and be able to challenge the decision in the courts. This is an amendment that could not be foreseen at the beginning. Everyone contributed to this process, and I hope that everyone will therefore be able to vote in favour of the proposals. Thank you very much.
(SV) Mr President, protection for internet users has been the focus of a large part of the telecoms debate. Last spring, Mrs Svensson and others voted down a proposal requiring a judicial review to be carried out if someone was to be excluded. Now we have a different solution, which protects users through very clear references to the regulatory system that is required to be in place in every Member State. I think it is important to say that the difference here is not about whether we want to protect users, but about whether we respect the Member States' right to decide on their own legal systems.
In this regard, it is interesting to note that one of the Swedish parliamentarians who is most against the European Union and Sweden's membership wants to make it more supranational than is usually proposed by anyone else in this Chamber, as she wants the European Union to legislate on how the Member States' legal systems should be organised. That is a major step and the vast majority in Parliament has opposed it, as we support the compromise that we now have and that will provide good protection for users. We also support this compromise because it will ensure that Europe's consumers and internet users will always be able to choose between different suppliers and different operators. Making it possible to change operators if a particular operator is providing a poor service gives consumers and citizens a power that they have never had before. Mrs Svensson, things have changed since the time when it was the large monopolies that determined citizens' rights to view, decide on and use information. This is a tremendous change that Mrs Svensson, and possibly others too, will, unfortunately, be voting against.
We need a completely new system to protect the intellectual property rights of creative forces on the internet, a system that we need to develop together. However, in terms of protecting the rights of the citizens, we need to be consistent, and this includes monitoring implementation in the Member States. It was, after all, the Council that was not in favour of protecting these rights and would have liked to see them fall by the wayside. We must engage in this power struggle with respect to the protection of the rights of the citizens and we must win. No Member State should now be allowed to worm their way out of these obligations.
The entire package, as it now stands, is exceptionally well balanced. On the one hand, it now enables us to seize opportunities for proper competition, for growth in this sector, and also, in economic terms, to seize opportunities for jobs and economic advantages. On the other hand, it makes particularly good provision for consumer protection. Consumers who are suspected of committing a punishable offence may only be cut off from the internet after a ruling has been brought by the judicial authorities and a clear procedure must be followed. We also have a provision for appeal, which means that established human rights are guaranteed, as they should be.
Last week, an important conference on internet governance took place under the aegis of the UN and it was also attended by a delegation from the European Parliament. It turned out that everyone in the world was looking to us to see how we are regulating this field. In many countries and throughout large parts of the world, governments seek to dictate what content can be shown on the internet and under what circumstances citizens may be cut off from the internet or, for that matter, allowed access to it. We are setting an example here of a good legislative framework and we are striking a balance between the market and the protection of citizens. Non-governmental civil society organisations, in particular, the whole world over, are looking at how this issue has been regulated in this package.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 November, Parliament was given the Council's guarantee that any restrictions on internet access can only be made if certain conditions are met: prior, fair and impartial procedure; a guarantee of the principle of presumption of innocence and the respect for privacy; and respect for the European Convention on Human Rights. This agreement is the first step towards better protection for citizens faced with growing attempts made by certain States and private operators to trivialise the principle of flexible response, data storage and the control of digital exchange on the internet.
We have seen that new generation technologies are appearing, and that these new generation technologies, such as the Fourth Generation LTE Network, need to be given space on the European internal market. In order for this to happen, we also need to make sensible use of digital dividends, and we need data roaming that corresponds to the needs of the internal market. I still foresee a great deal of work ahead of us in this field. The issue of internet freedom has been discussed rigorously and in great depth. I would like to thank everyone who took part in the debate. However, we still need to take action on the issue of intellectual property, to allow us to take the necessary measures during the next legislative term.
In this respect, I also look to the national regulatory bodies, which have now been granted additional powers through BEREC. It is their task to help their national industries and national consumers to assert their rights in the other 26 countries. In this regard, there is a great need for the national regulators to take action, as this is a starting point for a future expansion in the field of digital communication in Europe and beyond, and for Europe to take a leading role in this field at international level.
Mr President, let me change tack and bring to your attention some real-life facts. If you have to report major incidents, such as the breaking of your mail account, you can do it only electronically. There is no way to speak to a real person and establish a normal dialogue. If you have a problem you want to report to a telephone and internet provider, you get stuck in a labyrinth of recorded voices transferring you from one to another until the company is satisfied with the money they have got out of you, even if the problem you want to report has been caused by their faulty service.
As a result, many people view having easy access to the internet, and the wealth of information available online, as a necessity. In this respect, we also should not, and must not, forget those people who have, until now, not had access to the internet. That is why I specifically and strongly welcome the measures that have been taken thus far, as we are now on the right path to creating greater competition and improved access to important information. I am sure that whatever remains to be done can still be achieved in the future.
People have referred to the salient points: the rights of citizens, investment, controls, transparency, consolidation of the single market, a level playing field, accountability, proper competition and consumer protection. That is all very important. Mr van Nistelrooij said we are writing communications history here this evening. What needs to happen now is that this is transposed as soon as possible into national law and implemented, and the key points are three words: there will be free, fair and fast access to the internet for people and businesses, whether they are at the centre of the Union or in its outermost regions.
(NL) There are many good things in this package, but there are also a few things that I still have grave concerns about. One of them, of course, is the 'three strikes and you are out' provision and, to this very day, I cannot understand why it has been included in this telecommunications package at all. It is an entirely foreign element in the package. Nor do I understand why Europe has to provide reasons to the Member States as to why it is introducing such a provision. They themselves already have a pretty good idea of why it has been introduced and do not need Europe to tell them. To my mind, this is another splendid example of policy laundering.
I am disappointed that Parliament has not shown any backbone to the Council and has told the Council: this is what we have voted on and we are going to stick to our guns. I still have to make my mind up about how I am eventually going to vote because, as I said, there is a great deal that is good about this package. At the same time, however, I think that the telecommunications package as a whole is still something of a hotchpotch, that it falls short of the mark and that we need clarity about which areas it applies to and those which it does not apply to. I am assuming, therefore, that this is only a first step, but I want more safeguards and more assurances that we are not going to rely on this telecommunications package to solve the problem which the 'three strikes and you are out' policy is aimed at solving and that we will instead look to be guided by better regulations, in order to reward and protect intellectual, creative and financial efforts.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think that I can join all those who have said that this is a nice piece of collaboration in order to get a nice piece of legislation. No piece of legislation is perfect; this one is not perfect, either, and you know how much time we need in order to set up new legislation - so that by the time we arrive at an agreement, the world has already advanced so much that we should start from the beginning again. That is exactly the reason why we said that the protection of the individual rights on net neutrality is the first step; another step which needs to follow is how the copyright has to be adapted to the online world. Because we cannot wait until all these rules are implemented into national law, I have, in the name of the Commission, said that the Commission will monitor the impact of market and technological developments on the net freedoms and report to the European Parliament and the Council before the end of 2010. We then, altogether, have to see if we need to take other, supplementary measures or if we have to push to implement the existing measures which we are going to vote on tomorrow in the action at the level of the Member States.
Two concrete answers to two concrete questions: first, the declaration on Article 19 relating to harmonisation procedures. Exactly like Parliament, I regret that 16 Member Sates have made a declaration which calls into question the scope of the Commission's powers, agreed between the Parliament and the Council under the amended Article 19, in particular, the Commission's power in relation to the regulatory obligations that might be imposed by national regulatory authorities (NRAs). So, because there were those 16 declarations, the Commission has also made a declaration pointing out that, while it may not take decisions under the article that refer to specific notifications by NRAs under Article 7a, it may take decisions in relation to general regulatory approaches relating to the imposition, maintenance, amendment or withdrawal of such obligations. Parliament is right, an agreement has been made and we should not come back to such an agreement by the back door.
Second, the question of cookies. Now the Commission was, like Mr Harbour, surprised that certain Member States appeared to call the agreed text on cookies into question. Let me be very clear: we agreed with Parliament, and we believe that the final text is unambiguous. First, there must be clear and comprehensive information to users on the basis of which second users must give their consent. That is that and that should be applied now in the Member States. I do not appreciate it that after everything has been agreed, some like to manoeuvre in order not to keep 100% to the agreements pacta sunt servanda in politics. That is the way I see things. So I am very proud of the European institutions. I think that they have managed to make a good piece of legislation. They have also managed to keep this equilibrium between the interests of the operators, the economical part of the rules, and the interests of the users, the citizens' rights, and this equilibrium I think is what Europe is about: Europe is about economy and society. Here in this text, we have managed to bring both together. Congratulations to all those who have contributed to make this possible.
Indeed, we think that the information society should be both respectful of citizens' rights and positive from an economic and social point of view, opening up a new cultural sphere. That is why we anticipate that the market will enable this to happen, that users' rights will be stated and guaranteed, but that we can also have this extended access and connectivity for all. However, this is also why we now have a considerable job to do in the areas of copyright, net neutrality and radio spectrum. The European Parliament will lend its support.
Colleagues, you can imagine my frustration at not being able to participate in this debate, so I will simply use my institutional role at the end of it to congratulate warmly Catherine Trautmann, Pilar del Castillo Vera and Malcolm Harbour for their work; to thank the Commission, and especially Commissioner Reding, for their excellent cooperation throughout a very difficult process; and to state that it would have been a pleasure to have welcomed the Council to this important debate, as it might have been better able than the rest of us to explain those surprising letters that were mentioned on some legal aspects of this debate.
Mr President, I would like to touch on the thorny issue of the internet compromise (aka 'Amendment 138'). The regulatory package we have produced provides maximum safeguards for all internet users: we have ensured that users' privacy is respected and that the European Convention on Human Rights applies and, above all, that no one will ever have their internet access cut off without an independent body first considering and ruling on their case. What this means in concrete terms is that intervention is only permitted in cases of gross abuse. This legal provision applies to both the authorities and to internet providers themselves. Nonetheless, this European law guarantees free access to the internet and confirms de facto that the internet is a service of general interest, which no consumer can have cut off for no valid reason (just as no consumer can be denied access to gas, water or electricity). The fact that this compromise has received the unanimous approval of all the parliamentary delegations is proof that it is a terrific agreement and one which has placed the rights of the consumer at the very heart of the new telecommunications package.
We have reason to be very pleased with the result achieved today on the telecommunications package since it reinforces the rights of internet users and encourages competition between telephone companies. The new rules will guarantee greater rights for consumers, unconditional freedom of access to the internet and protection of personal data. This is an excellent example of how our work as legislators has an impact on citizens' daily lives. In fact, the internet, for the first time in the world, has come to represent the exercise of a right and a fundamental freedom. As such it will supplement, and take shape in proportion to, and in accordance with, other fundamental freedoms that already exist and which are guaranteed by the treaty: gender equality, respect for sexual orientation and religious belief, protection of the rights of the child, and freedom of expression that is consistent with the protection of human dignity. Any measure that restricts access to the internet may now be imposed only if it is deemed to be 'appropriate, proportionate and necessary' in a democratic society. Today, we have indicated our agreement to complete freedom of the internet, to the promotion of an electronic civil society, to the promotion of fundamental freedoms and best practices and to the identification and isolation of all those individuals, in particular, paedophiles and sex offenders, who seek to abuse this absolute freedom.
The basic aim of the alterations to the framework directive for electronic communications networks and services is to strengthen the rights of telephone and internet users and also to increase competition between telecommunications providers. Currently, electronic communications are regulated by rules which were approved seven years ago. Since then, the area has progressed dramatically. As a lawyer, I think that Parliament exceeded the authority given to it by the treaty by adding, at the last moment, a proposal for alterations which required public regulatory institutions to promote the interests of European Union citizens, prescribing that no restrictions may be imposed on the basic rights and freedoms of the end-user without a prior ruling by the Court. I am pleased that, as a result of the discussions held by the conciliation committee, a better way has been found to secure legal correctness in the text, and also to provide protection for all users and show respect for the jurisdictions of the Member States. The decision allows us finally to approve the changes to the framework directive for electronic communications networks and services.
Mr President, I would like to welcome Commissioner Kallas and my fellow Members. Fundamentally speaking, the issue we are about to discuss is not a controversial topic at all. The matter at hand is the adaptation of information technology in the field of customs and excise. For many people, this is a terribly technical topic. However, with respect to the fight against fraud and other crime, it is a very important aspect of cooperation in the field of customs and excise, and the exchange of information.
The only measure on which Parliament does not agree is the extension of Europol's powers in this field. This view is certainly not reflected in all political groups in this House. However, it is in the final result of the vote on the report on information technology in the field of customs and excise. This is, to a certain extent, linked to the debate which was held here previously, when our intention was different, namely to send a signal that, having fairly recently defined a mandate for Europol, under which it was to be an agency, its powers in a number of small and specific areas are being extended or expanded.
To a large extent, it is also fitting, given the importance and role of Europol, that its remit be defined in a mandate such as the one we have decided. It also promotes transparency, so that not only we, but in particular the citizens, for whom we make policies, know what Europol is allowed or not allowed to do. Transparency is a fundamental part of any structure involving prosecuting and police forces in the Member States, and this must also apply at a European level.
The Commission shares the opinion of the rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, that it is regrettable that this proposal should be decided in such a hurried manner by the Member States prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. In fact, the Lisbon Treaty provides a new legal basis whereby a new regulation could replace the present CIS Convention, a regulation which would have direct effect in Member States and not require transposition into national law before becoming operational, as is currently the case for Regulation (EC) No 766/2008 on the administrative part of the CIS.
Another point which was raised in one of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the fact that Member States, Europol and Eurojust are not granted the possibility to communicate data to non-Member States and third countries because of the absence of sufficient data protection in those countries. In my opinion, the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services' requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analyses of the information contained in the system.
I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, that we must remain alert so as to avoid any possible violation of basic rights, especially the right to privacy, according to which information of a personal nature entered into the system must be limited to what is strictly necessary, without contravening personal privacy. We must guarantee that this data can only be used for ends that are clearly defined and circumscribed within the framework of the applicable legislation. Moreover, this data should only be kept for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which they were recorded.
Just now, Mr Coelho referred to an issue, one that has also been mentioned by others, including Mrs Vergiat, which has given us much food for thought. When we are faced with the task of achieving the highest possible standards with respect to the data pertaining to our citizens, then it is not terribly helpful - and perhaps this is something that the Commission should consider in the future, in spite of their rejection of the proposals - for us to have provisions concerning Europol's remit, namely what data is processed, under whose authority this is done or to whom it is transferred, which are divided between numerous legislative dossiers. There comes a point when it is no longer clear what data may be used by Europol and how it may do so, and what data may not be used. With regard to the Europol mandate, it would make more sense if all this was established in general terms, instead of legislation always being drawn up on a case by case basis. It would make the legislation more transparent for the citizens and would surely also benefit Europol's work.
Other than that, I have nothing more to add. Perhaps I may just add a brief comment regarding a point that was mentioned earlier, namely the different access rights granted to Eurojust and Europol. In this case, of course, one must take into account the fact that a law enforcement body operates in a different way to a prosecuting body and should, therefore, have a different remit. However, if we are to have a Justice Commissioner in the future, we may also be able to deal with this issue at European level.
When I first stood for the European Parliament in 1984, I remarked to one of my then colleagues, Ken Collins, a Scottish Member, that I was wondering whether I was doing the wrong thing, because Parliament did not seem to have much teeth when it came to legislative matters. Ken said to me that it was true that Parliament did not have a lot of teeth, but, if you asked any mother of a young baby, you would know that you can make a big impression with your gums.
This Parliament did make a big impression with its gums in terms of using the right to be consulted on legislation. Since then, we have had the Single European Act, which took the European Parliament from being a baby to infanthood, Maastricht which took us through puberty, the Nice and the Amsterdam Treaties, which took us into adulthood, and now the Lisbon Treaty, which I believe takes this Parliament into the full rights of an adult Parliament, comparable to any other democratic institution in the European Union.
I am honoured, but to be honest, I am also slightly disappointed, because this report should really be called the Corbett report. My colleague, Richard Corbett, did all the hard work on this report before the elections. He made it very easy for me in terms of the Lisbon aspects of the report. Although we have had controversy over the non-Lisbon aspects of the report, Richard Corbett did an excellent job in terms of the Lisbon aspects and I really only had to pick up the baton.
Firstly, who should chair our delegation to COSAC? Should it be the Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs or should it be a vice-president of Parliament, as is presently the situation? My own view is that it should be a vice-president; the committee has decided that it should be the Chair. In the end, the plenary will decide, but I make the point that COSAC is about more than interinstitutional relations. It also deals with policy matters and that is why historically, we have had a vice-president chairing the delegation.
In terms of our relationship with the national parliaments, we have had some disagreement in the committee on how much detail we should go into, and how much the rules should prescribe that relationship. I have managed to reach a compromise with Mr Brok, who has been very accommodating in this matter, which lays down some detail but which still leaves enough room for the President of Parliament to negotiate with his counterparts in the national parliaments the exact modalities of how we will cooperate with the national parliaments.
A third issue where there has been some controversy is how to deal with the principle of subsidiarity. We have settled quite easily the role that the committees will play in this matter, and there is consensus around that. The only point that has emerged is what happens if a committee says 'no, there is no breach of subsidiarity and the legislation should go ahead'. Should there be a safety valve for Members of the European Parliament to raise the matter on the floor of this House? I have put down an amendment, and others have put down similar amendments, suggesting that if one tenth of the Members of the European Parliament reckon there is an issue of subsidiarity, then that matter should be debated on the floor of the House. I think that is a sensible safety valve.
The last issue that I want to mention is the issue of observers, and whether we should have observers in advance of the 18 new Members taking their seats. My view is that we absolutely should. However, the crucial issue - and, again, there is consensus in the committee on this - is whether these observers should be people who would otherwise have been elected to Parliament. That is critical for our credibility. If we allow the Member States simply to appoint anyone to take the role of observer - and we do have rumours that some Member States want to appoint national parliamentarians - I think that would be entirely unacceptable.
I would like to thank both the rapporteur, Mr Martin, and Mr Corbett for the work they have done on this. The report features all the key points, such as maintaining contact with national parliaments, a stricter and significantly more clearly defined application than is the case at present of the principle of subsidiarity, as well as comitology procedures and parliaments' new codecision rights, while issues relating to budget procedures feature in this report, which we definitely support.
At the same time, we must make sure, and I would like to draw your attention to this with regard to voting on proposed amendments, that these rights cannot be abused. A tiny minority should not be able to abuse or impede the actual legislative process. We must find flexible solutions. We observed during the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon how a single person, a single state president was able to play with the whole system. This is precisely why only those guarantees must be included which cannot be abused to the utmost degree. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) supports this report and we congratulate both rapporteurs, Mr Corbett and Mr Martin.
The first is that, while there was some confusion in the Conference of Presidents as to what types of amendments should be adopted or accepted, based on whether they are as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon in the strictest sense, I would like to express our desire for it to be the President of Parliament who decides whether any of the reforms of the Rules of Procedure are not appropriate. In this respect, I agree with it being the President who decides, and we will go along with that decision.
In my view, it seems important that these amendments include new provisions on the simplified and the ordinary amendments to the treaty. From my point of view, it seems important to unanimously support amendment proposals which aim to improve cooperation with national parliaments. In other sections, we would like to go further, especially in cases such as our representation, namely the representation of the European Parliament, in COSAC, but this is something that can be discussed at a later date. For now, I welcome the broad consensus achieved and wish to particularly thank the rapporteurs.
To what am I referring? I am referring to Article 192(1). The provision stipulating that the Groups may elect a coordinator has been pushed through via the back door, and unnoticed by many. Previously, Mr President, we always had the following addendum: 'the relevant provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to Non-attached Members'. This interpretation no longer stands. I wrote a letter to you. Two months later, you responded and merely repeated the paragraph. Please read my letter again. Please understand that you are currently very close to letting a Parliament which, in principle, I support, degenerate into a two-tier Parliament. In view of your personal background, how can you do such a thing? Because we, as Non-attached Members, do not have the opportunity to obtain the relevant information in time and take an active part in making decisions concerning reports and similar matters. In this respect, the Rules of Procedure must be changed.
Therefore, the fact that the opportunity has been taken to make a few corrections, also with reference to other aspects, within the ambit of a wider reform of the Rules of Procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon cannot, in my view, be seen as unacceptable - all the more so since quite a few amendments would serve to reflect the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Rules of Procedure, sometimes through rules that are reproduced technically and materially in them, but much more often through reference to the spirit of the treaty. One need only think of the role of Parliament, which has been strengthened in relation to the Council, but which is also being strengthened by the Rules of Procedure where the internal relationships with institutions within Parliament itself are concerned. We shall, of course, respect your decisions, Mr President, but I felt it was necessary to make these observations.
Let me quote just one example. I am pleased that Parliament has clearly had its say in support of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it unequivocally supports. However, we are well aware that in the particular case of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, several countries have requested a derogation, not to mention that this charter, too, contains issues and unresolved problems such as the question of language rights due to be debated tomorrow evening. So far, Europe's commissioners have actually said that these are not part of Community law.
I have noticed that the meetings of the chairmen of the committees of the national parliaments are attended by vice-chairmen, rather than the chairmen, of European Parliament committees. With respect to the rights of MEPs, if a committee submits proposals for a decision in Plenary, it is not for the Parliamentary Services, or any other bodies, to decide whether these proposals are right or wrong. It is something that should be decided by the MEPs themselves. If the proposals are bad, they will not be supported by the majority.
Pursuant to Rule 157(3), it is up to you, but I would ask you, Mr President, to take into account the wise words of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Casini. I do not think it can be left in the hands of the Parliament's services to determine which amendments relate to the Treaty of Lisbon and which do not. Moreover, this House has the sovereign right to decide whether or not an amendment is necessary, at this time when, as everyone has said, a new phase is beginning.
The programme will be based on the Commission communication, but also on the many opinions that have been put forward by national parliaments, civil society and various EU bodies and agencies during the process. The programme is, of course, also a result of intensive contact and in-depth negotiations with the EU Member States and also with the European Parliament. The European Parliament's attitude to the future cooperation is important, particularly in view of the greater role that Parliament will have as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon.
The vision of the Stockholm Programme is for a safer and more open Europe where the rights of individuals are protected. The needs of citizens, of individuals, will form the basis for future cooperation in this area in a way that is much more evident than it was previously. We are working on behalf of the citizens, and they need to feel that future EU cooperation is important to them. It should therefore be based on real problems, ask relevant questions and focus on specific measures that will provide added value to people's everyday lives.
A key element of combating crime is, of course, an efficient exchange of information, tailored to our needs. At European level we should, in certain cases, standardise the exchange of information, adapt it to our needs and make it more efficient. At the same time, it is extremely important to ensure that the exchange of information complies with the basic requirements for data protection and the protection of privacy that we must impose and that no more information is gathered and stored than is needed to serve the purpose. We must create a secure Europe in which cross-border crime is combated effectively, while at the same time, the privacy of individuals is respected. It is completely possible and absolutely necessary to do both of these things. It is a matter of finding the right balance for the various measures.
The principle of mutual recognition must continue to be a fundamental principle in our legal cooperation. A prerequisite for Member States wishing to recognise and enforce the judgments and decisions of other States is that there is mutual trust in one another's legal systems. It is also a question of trust between our national authorities, and citizens should have trust in the measures that are decided on. One way of increasing trust is to increase our knowledge of one another's legal systems. It may be a matter of providing training, exchange programmes, strengthening existing networks and well-developed evaluation mechanisms.
However, perhaps the most important measure for developing trust is to guarantee certain minimum rights irrespective of where someone is within the European Union. These are simple things such as being able to find out, in a language that you understand, what you are accused of and what rights you have as a suspect or victim in a legal process. It is very gratifying that, within the Council, we have been able to agree on a road map for how the procedural rights for suspects and defendants are to be dealt with and implemented step by step. It would be desirable for the road map to be included in the Stockholm Programme and I believe that it will be.
Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament for its very constructive cooperation in respect of the European Asylum Support Office. There are still a few formalities to iron out, but the conditions will soon be in place for this office to be set up. The Council has a very positive view of the constructive cooperation with the European Parliament that has led to us achieving this result. It bodes well for the increased cooperation that we will experience once the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force. The fact that we have been able to arrive at a quick decision with regard to the Support Office is a good example of an efficient and well-functioning codecision process.
What we are to debate here today is, of course, the forthcoming five-year programme for the work in connection with justice and home affairs. I will start by saying that much has happened within the EU in the area of asylum and migration over the last few years. For example, we have taken decisions on joint legislation with regard to the first foundations of a common immigration policy and a common asylum system. Incidentally, that is an objective that was stated in both of the previous work programmes from Tampere and The Hague. When the European Council adopted the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum last year, this policy area was given new political force. Now it is time to set the course for the continued development of the policy in this area. The basic premise for our work is that well-managed migration can be a positive thing for all parties concerned, not only for the individual Member States and for the EU as a whole, but also for the countries of origin and the individual migrants. If we are to be able to meet the objectives of the Lisbon strategy that the EU should be a dynamic and competitive economy, we will probably need to allow the immigration of workers on a larger scale than we are currently doing, particularly in view of the demographic challenge we are facing.
During the work on the Stockholm Programme, it emerged that there is agreement on the need for the Member States to prevent illegal immigration into the EU in a joint and coordinated way. The development of an effective repatriation policy is an important element of this work. There is no doubt that Frontex has an important role to play in this regard, and it is clear that the Member States want to see the agency strengthened. Increasing cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is also of major interest. However, I would like to emphasise that, in the work to prevent illegal immigration, it is important that we maintain a balance, so that security measures are not implemented at the cost of making lawful immigration to the EU complicated or access to the asylum process more difficult for asylum seekers. The risks to vulnerable groups, for example, children coming alone, must also be minimised. The Commission is going to produce an action plan containing measures that take account of the best interests of the children.
The issue of solidarity and division of responsibility will be dealt with in the Stockholm Programme. There are no simple solutions. Our starting point should be to seek broad and sustainable solutions, based on the global approach to migration and the awareness that joint cooperation with third countries is a crucial factor. Some form of solidarity mechanism needs to be developed to be able to help those Member States that find themselves under particular pressure and that receive a disproportionate number of asylum seekers. The Member States must also receive support for further capacity building. Frontex must be strengthened and be given a greater role in repatriation. The aim is for us to be better able to show solidarity with both the Member States and the third countries that are subject to the greatest migration pressure. At the same time, we must be clear that we need a comprehensive approach that is sustainable in both the short and the long term.
It is important for it to be stated in the Stockholm Programme that the goal previously set of creating a common European asylum system by 2012 at the latest remains. The mainstay of the common asylum system must be that an individual asylum seeker should experience the same reception and have his or her application assessed according to the same criteria irrespective of which Member States he or she arrives in. Well-functioning practical cooperation is fundamental to us being able to achieve this. In this connection, the Asylum Support Office will have an important role to play.
Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Treaty of Lisbon. The new treaty will bring major changes in the area of freedom, security and justice as a result of the introduction of a number of new legal bases. The ordinary legislative procedure that is being introduced will mean that the European Parliament is given a greater role in the legislative process in a number of areas. Mrs Ask and I are looking forward to increased cooperation with the European Parliament. I also believe that the new tasks conferred on the national parliaments will be important in strengthening the democratic control over this policy area. Thank you very much for your attention. As my colleague Mrs Ask said, we now look forward to hearing your views.
With regard to fundamental rights, we have achieved two major breakthroughs with the Treaty of Lisbon: the Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes binding, and the door is open for the Union to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights. As you stress in your resolution, we must come up with a comprehensive data protection system that incorporates technological developments. The Commission will present a communication on this subject in 2010. I also believe that we will have to cover all of the Union's policies with this comprehensive data protection system.
Generally speaking, the Commission and Parliament share the same will when it comes to combating all forms of discrimination and to promoting equality between men and women. I welcome the fact that Parliament and the Commission take the same approach, which is to put Europeans at the heart of their action with regard to freedom of movement, electoral rights, consular protection, and so on. We are now going to be able to put all of this into practice. The Treaty of Lisbon authorises the citizens' initiative procedure, and the Commission has just published a green paper on this point. A proposal will be submitted in 2010 on the basis of the outcome of the consultations carried out.
This area of freedom, security and justice does, of course, demand a strong external dimension that is consistent with the Union's foreign policy. You mention on several occasions, in your resolution, the importance of monitoring, the conducting of assessments. We share your view on this point too. We must reduce the considerable gap between the standards and policies adopted at European level and their application at national level. We must also give thought to the possible impact of legislative proposals on citizens and we must improve the way in which the evaluation of the instruments adopted is used.
To conclude, the Commission is fully involved in negotiating the Stockholm Programme. I said how satisfied I was with our cooperation with the Swedish Presidency, with which we have really done a thorough, serious job. Obviously, Parliament's opinion is very important to us, not least in these final moments before the Stockholm Programme is adopted by the European Council. That is why I thank you most sincerely, and that is also why I, in turn, will listen to you very carefully. Thank you, Parliament.
The first point is working with the Council. We always have representatives of the Council here and they always tell us, as Presidents-in-Office of the Council, that Parliament is very important and that we must work together. When they leave that role, however, that understanding often crumbles away. It will be our job, as parliamentarians, to demand of the Council that it no longer allow this understanding to slip away, or for it - as with the SWIFT agreement, for example - to create precedents, despite not involving us here in Parliament in the approval process. That cannot, and in future, will not, be the situation any longer. It was a bad example of the institutions taking each other seriously.
The process brought in by the treaty will strengthen the Union from within and also in a global context, and is also very closely linked to strengthening cooperation in the area of the current third pillar. The Union will be more open, more effective and more democratic. The main challenge and priority is to secure fundamental rights and freedoms as well as integrity and security in Europe through fully supporting effective implementation and sufficient respect for and improvement of existing legal instruments, while taking into account the protection of human rights and civic freedoms.
On a British Airways flight from Johannesburg, a well-off, middle-aged white South African lady found herself sitting next to a black man. She called the stewardess over to complain about her seating. 'What seems to be the problem, Madam?' 'Well, can't you see?' she said, 'I can't possibly sit next to this disgusting human. Find me another seat!' A few minutes later, the stewardess returned. 'Madam, unfortunately, as I suspected, economy class is full. I have spoken to the cabin services director and Club is also full. However, we do have one seat in first class.' Before the South African lady had a chance to answer, the stewardess continued, 'It is quite exceptional to make this kind of upgrade, but given the circumstances the captain felt that it was outrageous that someone should be forced to sit next to such an obnoxious person.' She then turned to the black man sitting next to the South African lady and said, 'Sir, if you would like to get your things, I have a seat ready for you in first class up at the front.' The surrounding passengers gave a standing ovation while the black man walked up to first class.
Now, what has this got to do with us? Do we consider others inferior? The white South African lady would shock us all. But that was obviously an extreme example. However, I do think that some of our colleagues in the EPP in particular, but also in the Council, understand perfectly what I am trying to say here. The other group, my group, firmly believes in a Europe which people can understand, trust and believe in. Such a Europe must be based on human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and, yes, true equality for all. It is high time to tackle all forms of discrimination on all grounds, including on the basis of sexual orientation.
Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are already very much asking ourselves how it can be that we are deciding here about a resolution on a programme that is already out of date? Only yesterday, the Swedish Presidency tabled a new and highly amended proposal for the Stockholm Programme. I would assume that the vast majority of Members of this esteemed Chamber have not had the opportunity to read the proposal in question. In my opinion, that is an unacceptable situation for this highly sensitive matter.
What is more, the procedure within Parliament that led to this resolution was largely opaque and, at times, chaotic. The smaller groups were excluded from the process of drawing up the resolution as far as possible, and the abundance of amendments to the procedures of the joint committees posed significant obstacles to democratic decision making. Please make allowance, then, for our requests for a whole series of split votes. Parliament seriously needs to consider how it wants to deal with these conditions, both in respect of the Council and of its own Members.
I will turn now to the content of the Stockholm Programme. Parts of this work programme are undoubtedly to be viewed as progress. When it comes to justice and the common construction of civil law rules, we Greens, too, see positive beginnings for the coming years. However, when it comes to the relationship of the citizens to the State, the programme is a manifestation of an utterly badly erected framework. In relation to migration and asylum policy, civil rights and data protection, the need for security in Europe has been prioritised ahead of human rights and freedom. It is being openly suggested that more freedom in Europe would automatically lead to less security.
That also means consciously standing up and advocating what you believe in. This applies, for example, to our debates about the SWIFT agreement. Why are we once more giving way to US policy when it comes to security policy matters - as in the case of the SWIFT agreement - without reason, and without having a comprehensive debate on the matter in this House once again. Why do we, Parliament, allow the Council to run rings around us time and again? We, Parliament, very much need to do something about that. Send out a message here and now in favour of human rights and in favour of freedom - including to your governments - and vote in favour of all our amendments. We Greens cannot vote 'yes' to the resolution as it stands.
Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security. It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom. Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being. Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU's manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control, which will then mix intelligence service and police data on a pan-European basis. This will mean the shredding of people's right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality.
When this happens, it is the individual citizens, the very people who the EU pushes to the top of the agenda time and again, who have their data recorded and collected, even where there is no suspicion of criminal activity, and whose data is then potentially subject to misuse. Officially, the aim here is to combat organised crime. That is all well and good, but there are already first signs and tendencies, expressions of opinion, that do not correspond to the consensus of what has come to be called political correctness, to restrict, to prohibit and, who knows, sooner or later, to punish. George Orwell warned us of this - and we must prevent it from occurring.
There have, in fact, been problems, some of them serious, with regard to the timeframe and, above all, the involvement of the shadow rapporteurs and the timely translation of the amendments, of which there were nearly 500. However, all that is due not to Rule 51 itself, but rather to the very short deadlines that we gave ourselves in order to have a document that we could submit to the Council summit taking place on 10 December. It was thus inevitable that there would be these problems linked to the pace of work. For the rest, I believe that we should acknowledge that Rule 51, which has been used for the first time, is useful.
The document under consideration by this Parliament cannot be explained in the few seconds that remain to me. However, I must express my satisfaction that the codecision system has been extended to become the normal system of legislation, that immigration is now understood to be a European issue - and I hope that this is how the Commission and the Council interpret it - and not a problem for individual Member States acting in solidarity with each other, that the view taken of cooperation with the national parliaments is not that they are guardians laying down limits, but rather positive collaborators in the legislative process, and finally, that there is that reference to human rights which is extremely important, and which is the spirit of the European Union.
Above all, however, I would like to highlight the work of this Parliament, because three committees, the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, have worked shoulder to shoulder under the Article 51 procedure for the first time, and we have done so in order to be ready on time. This is because it is important, really important, to drive forward the area of freedom, justice and security, keeping in mind that the Treaty of Lisbon is going to enter into force, which represents a great step forward. It will be a great step forward because it will strengthen Parliament, which is going to be a colegislator and decision maker in a whole area that, until now, had been the domain of intergovernmental cooperation, but also because the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the mandate to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights are entering into force, which will strengthen the harmonious relationship between freedom and security.
Security is not subordinate to freedom, nor is it a threat to freedom. Security is a citizen's right, as is freedom. This is the case in many of the constitutions of the Member States, and they must come together in a single effort to cover the status of European citizenship, the fundamental rights of citizens, immigration, asylum, refuge, managing the EU's external borders and judicial cooperation. This needs to be done in order to strengthen mutual trust, mutual recognition of our civil rights, of the law of contracts, which boosts economic growth and job creation, and, above all, police and criminal judicial cooperation in order to combat real common enemies together: organised crime and terrorism.
Parliament has worked hard, and has improved the document produced by the Council. It has improved it by strengthening the anti-discrimination clause, in particular, with regard to women and children, and there is a commitment to combat gender violence and to protect the victims of gender violence by strengthening the solidarity clause in terms of asylum. This demonstrates that neither immigration nor asylum are a problem affecting just one Member State, but that they require cooperation between all the Member States, because otherwise we will not be able to tackle them.
My second point is the one illustrated very well by my colleague Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert. I should like to remind Parliament, particularly the two large groups, that equality is indivisible. We cannot give a bit of equality to some groups and not to others. In the past, the State would interfere in people's choice of partner and ban marriages between people of certain religions and between people of different races. Fortunately, those days are gone; and so, in my opinion, no Member State of the European Union should be refusing to recognise a marriage legally contracted in another Member State, and that includes marriages between two people of the same sex. Therefore, I would appeal to the two large groups to withdraw the compromise by which they seek to weaken the rights of homosexual couples. Here, I am looking in particular at our friends in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.
Let me tell you what your common legal system has done for the life of one person. Andrew Symeou, a 20-year-old London man, was extradited to Greece this summer on a manslaughter charge. He now languishes in a Greek prison awaiting trial. The evidence against him would not stand up for five minutes if examined by a British court. The identification evidence is contradictory. Witness statements have all the signs of having been written by the police. Two witnesses claim they were beaten and mistreated and forced to sign statements which they later immediately withdrew.
I also want to say something about the harmonisation of EU asylum law. This is definitely the right thing to do. We need to make absolutely clear, though, that without harmonisation of the economic conditions in the different countries, this will not work, as people will, naturally enough, go to where they can find the best social security, the highest incomes, the cleanest streets and the safest towns and cities. One thing is clear, and that is that we should indeed have harmonisation, but Europe must not become a land of self-service asylum policy.
How are we going to get there? We will succeed by means of the Stockholm Programme, which is a five year work programme. It is a far reaching programme which covers several areas falling under the umbrella of justice, freedom and security. Parliament's resolution defines the European Parliament's political priorities in this area. For example, our priorities in the area of immigration lie in the fight against illegal immigration as well as a common asylum policy that is built upon true and obligatory solidarity. I must also add that the European Parliament has a very significant and constructive role to play by way of the codecision powers it will enjoy once the Lisbon Treaty comes into force.
There are also certain political differences within the internal dimension of this Parliament. Why not? There are different political groups and there are differing political views. However, allow me to say, with particular reference to my fellow Member, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, for whom I have a lot of respect, that human rights are a political priority for the European Popular Party Group too, and that they do not pertain to the monopoly of the Liberal Group in this Chamber. We cannot accept the Liberal Group's presumption to the right to monopolise the principle of non-discrimination. We believe in this principle; however, we also believe in the subsidiarity principle, meaning that we are also under obligation to respect national sensitivities in the European Union's Member States. We must not forget that this Union is built upon unity in diversity and not unity in homogeneity.
That is the citizen's Europe. It should be constructed within the Member States and the Community institutions. European society is more united, and mobility is more pronounced than is commonly believed. Mobility is now a right. The borders between the Member States are not impermeable walls, but nets through which society filters daily. The Stockholm Programme constitutes the institutional cornerstone that provides for judicial cooperation and mutual recognition, a European justice system (made up of the national systems and the Community system), both national and Community law, European citizens and European courts (both national and Community courts).
(EL) Mr President, for some months now, we have been talking about the need to strike the right balance between maintaining security and defending citizens' personal rights, emphasising that citizens must be at the epicentre of the Stockholm Programme. However, the European Union is adopting and applying measures which upset the balance between security and rights, result in the creation of bodies to monitor and collect all sorts of personal data and insult our dignity by making suspects of us all. Furthermore, it is unacceptable for immigrants to be treated as criminals and possible terrorists. We disagree with the draft resolution, because it lays the foundations for us to build a modern European Panopticon in which, like the prison designed by Jeremy Bentham, everyone's actions are constantly monitored without the detainees' knowing the extent of their supervision, thereby giving them a false sense of privacy.
(PL) Mr President, I do not hesitate to say that in the area of justice in the European Union, the Stockholm Programme is the most ambitious initiative of the last few years. I am all the more pleased because one of the fundamental ideas of the programme is to make life easier for the residents of the European Union. Of course, proper implementation of the Stockholm Programme in the area of justice will depend on the establishment of a truly European judicial culture, changes in the practical approach to establishing new legislation, and also on the proper function of the e-justice portal.
The principle of mutual recognition, which is, to me, a fundamental one, requires mutual trust, but also confidence in the legal systems of other countries, as has been talked about here today. These values can only come from mutual recognition and understanding, which will then give rise to a European judicial culture. Mutual acquaintance and understanding can themselves only come about as a result of active, favourable policy, including exchange of experience, visits, sharing information, and courses for people working in the justice system, especially judges in courts of first instance. It also includes thorough modernisation, and this is extremely important, of university education programmes within the European Union.
Another matter is to stress the significance of the multilingual e-justice portal. The portal should have access to legal databases and to judicial and non-judicial electronic means of appeal. It should also give access to intelligent systems developed as aids to citizens who are seeking ways to resolve legal problems or who are using extensive registers, lists of people working in the justice system or just simple guides to the legal system of each Member State. So I am very pleased that Mrs Ask and Mr Barroso have spoken about this.
I am delighted to see that, in the resolution, the European Union's anti-drug strategy has a place in the creation of this European judicial area. However, I hope that the European Union will show more initiative in this regard. Why does the Union not equip itself with new weapons for combating this growing trend, which affects our children at an increasingly early age? They are the future. What are we doing to protect them? Let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions! That is what our fellow citizens expect from us.
Mr President, this has been a long journey, from Tampere, where we saw just the outlines of an area of freedom, security and justice - and perhaps we talk too much - to this extraordinary position where we have Stockholm and Lisbon colliding. I say respectfully to all of those who believe that we do not need a blueprint to fight our corner for the area of freedom and security and justice that we want: we do not take our players off the field when the game begins. We fight our progressive corner and, for our group, we will fight for our progressive policies.
But we must have a Stockholm blueprint in the first place. We have Lisbon, so we - all Members here, however they vote - will have to assume our responsibility to legislate after Christmas on the things that matter to us. This is a serious responsibility and my group - as our hard-working rapporteurs Mr López Aguilar and Mr Berlinguer have set out - has its priorities. We will then have an area of freedom, security and justice in a democracy that we win or we lose.
Ultimately, we play the game because, for our citizens, this is not a game. This is about delivering at last - at long last - the rights that they have asked for for so long: fundamental rights on data protection, on security and on anti-terrorism. All of these things will mean something when we assume the responsibility in this House to legislate. We will only do that when we vote through the Stockholm Programme. We will then fight for a progressive Stockholm Programme and progressive legislation.
This five-year programme goes back to the aims of Tampere, seeking real progress in many areas. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that these targets are met. The legislation and instruments that have been adopted must be implemented effectively. The people of Europe will not take us seriously if we do not pass this test of our effectiveness. It is, for instance, impossible to push for an entry/exit system, inviting the Commission to present a proposal for this system to begin operations in 2015, when we do not know whether the Schengen Information System II or the Visa Information System will begin operations, as they are beset by problems and massive delays.
Finally, I would like to give a warning about fundamentalist application of the principle of subsidiarity. I hear my fellow Members talking about the need for the national parliaments to be respected, and this is true, but I have to warn you that a rigid and fundamentalist interpretation of subsidiarity will not allow progress to be made in the Stockholm Programme. If the Member States hold on to an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, there will be no joint legislation on the Stockholm Programme.
Mr President, I wish to refer briefly to the section on economic crime and corruption in the Stockholm Programme. The text has lost some of its teeth during the negotiations in Coreper. For instance, today's text refers to GRECO standards on anti-corruption, with GRECO being a Council of Europe body. While cooperation with GRECO and the Council of Europe is essential, the European Union's standards on anti-corruption are higher than those of the Council of Europe which, as we all know, has 47 Member States.
However, I am disappointed that nothing has been mentioned about developing a children's rights strategy for Europe, as proposed by Parliament quite recently. Just as Commissioner Barrot said, the European Union must continue to stand up for children's rights. As regards the wording concerning people trafficking, I am also disappointed that the Presidency has not stuck to its guns with regard to the link to the purchase of sex, the purchase of services and the possibility of legislating in this area. The EU also needs a legal basis for combating violence against women.
I regret that the reference to the right of non-EU nationals to vote and to the guarantee of access to health care for ill migrants has been left out of the resolution. However, I would mention the adoption of some important points, such as the requirement for the directive on non-discrimination to be adopted; freedom of movement for European citizens and families - I understand this to mean all families; the request to remove obstacles to the exercise of the right to family reunification; and the ban on placing unaccompanied minors in detention, to name but a few.
Someone said at the start of the debate 'why are we discussing one draft when there is already a new one?'. The truth is that the European Parliament is mid-way through the discussions and negotiations that are ongoing. It is changing all the time and on Friday, or at the weekend, there will be another draft. However, to the Member who thought that he had an old document, I can say that we have always presented the most recent draft on the Presidency's website. Those Members who wish to keep up to date and see what is happening with this and also how your debate affects the final result should, of course, ensure that they obtain the documents that we publish.
As far as the Presidency is concerned, it has been of the utmost importance to work with transparency and openness. That is why we have very many discussions. The ten of you who did not have the opportunity to present your views here are very welcome to email me or Mr Billström. It is very simple; the address is beatrice.ask@justice.ministry.se and Mr Billström's address follows the same format. You can then send us your points of view so that they are taken into account. We must start to work in a modern way, and openness is the modern way for the Swedish Presidency. I look forward to the resolution and its outcome, as I detect a lot of support for some of the views, nuances and emphases that the resolution contains. We will, of course, give these careful consideration.
There are also a few political issues that I would just like to mention. Firstly, two Members, one of whom was Mr Batten, mentioned specific examples of how citizens are affected - perhaps in another country - and it is their opinion that conditions are not very good. Those are typical examples of a lack of trust in one another's legal systems. In this case, we have two choices: the first is to tell our citizens to stay at home, because we always have the best legal systems at home. However, if we believe that our citizens will continue to take advantage of the opportunity for free movement, then it is perhaps time to think about how we can improve procedural rights and other aspects across the Union as a whole. That is precisely the aim of the Stockholm Programme. That is why I am so very pleased that we have been able to take the first step in strengthening procedural rights in order to guarantee that anyone who is suspected of a crime or is a victim of a crime and is involved in a legal process in Europe will now actually receive help with translation and interpretation. This fundamental right can be found in the conventions of the European Council and elsewhere, but is not found in practice. Now we can make a difference and that is exactly what we should do.
Mrs Macovei raised the issue of corruption and financial crime and was of the opinion that the wording was too weak on this. I would like to say that this is a very clear section, which makes high demands. The fact that we mention the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) has nothing to do with us intending to adopt a lower level of ambition on account of their views - nor is that what is stated in the Stockholm Programme. What is stated is that, along with many other tasks, we aim to cooperate closely with this important body on these matters, as we need to go for the money if we are to combat organised crime. I believe that this is important.
Many people mentioned subsidiarity. I think that the proposal that is currently under discussion takes a very clear position in that EU cooperation in the areas of justice and home affairs should constitute an added value. Anything that is dealt with just as well at national level should be allowed to remain there. It is when we need cooperation that we must use the European institutions. I do not think that we are taking away the rights of the nation states, but instead we are providing an added value that could benefit all citizens.
Lastly, I would like to talk about the issue of privacy and data protection, which is a major and important debate. I believe it was Mr Borghezio who mentioned this and felt that there was a great deal of concern about the Stockholm Programme as it stands. He expressed concern about monitoring and large databases, among other things. He also compared what we are working on in this area with the situation in the former East Germany and in the communist states that used to exist in Europe. I think that this type of argument is completely irrelevant. In East Germany, there was no data protection, no democracy and there were no fundamental rights for citizens - three important factors that are fundamental to our cooperation. As regards the Stockholm Programme, we are strengthening and tightening up the regulations for data protection and respect for the rights of individuals, and democracy, too, in a number of different respects. The fact is that the information strategy that we want the EU to draw up balances a methodical and effective exchange of information with stringent requirements for the protection of privacy and secure data management, but also the requirement for information not to be retained for a long period. Please feel free to read these sections again, as they are very clear. This represents progress, for which we have also received praise from the EU ombudsman, who is working on this.
Finally, someone said that we should make the Stockholm Programme more tangible. The programme contains a lot of very tangible and practical elements, but the real work starts now. Some Members pointed out that the resolution had to be drawn up within a tight deadline and that it was very difficult to do it all in time. I can say to you that it will get worse yet. Once we have adopted the Stockholm Programme, you will be involved in the important work that needs to be done in implementing and dealing with the details of the various proposals. This will involve a lot of time pressure and a lot of stress, but also great challenges and great opportunities to make a difference. Thank you very much for your views and, as I said, please use the internet if you want to contact the Presidency in the coming days.
I would like to emphasise the importance of cooperation in all significant areas within this programme. In his speech, Mr Busuttil made comparisons with the magnitude of the internal market, which I think is not so far from the truth, as this is a similar project in terms of its size and importance. One word that has, of course, come up time and again in the political talks on asylum and migration issues in recent years has been solidarity. All the Member States agree that solidarity must be increased, and not only solidarity between Member States, but also solidarity between the EU and third countries. That is the message that we want to send out through the Stockholm Programme.
The global approach to migration should be one of the important starting points in this connection. The role of Frontex should be strengthened. Mrs Keller mentioned this in her speech. I would like to make it very clear that Frontex alone is not the answer to this problem. Frontex is responsible for the coordination of the Member States' border controls, but it has no mandate within sea rescue, for example. The situation in the Mediterranean is not primarily a border control problem. It is a problem that requires several different types of measure. Increased cooperation between the countries of origin and transit is of the utmost importance. We also need to invest in development cooperation in the form of aid. I think it is important to emphasise that the European Parliament will be involved to the very highest degree in all of these aspects now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon in place, and democratic control will increase in these areas.
Based on everything that has been said here today, I also think that it is important to point out that the Treaty of Lisbon really will bring about a genuine and important change. It is, of course, a major change that will see the ordinary legislative procedure being replaced by one that gives the European Parliament a stronger role in the legislative process in a number of areas. Thus, I do not share any of the concern that Mrs Keller expressed here today with regard to these issues. On the contrary, I think that we are seeing huge progress towards increased democratic control in this policy area.
I would add that we cannot accept the term 'fortress Europe' either. Mr Billström has covered this. This, too, is the guarantee of a balanced European migration policy. If we are rejecting illegal, clandestine immigration, it is because of all the trafficking and all the organised crime behind it. There is no denying that this is the case. Furthermore, however, it is true that we have succeeded, I believe, in presenting an asylum policy that is in keeping with European values of generosity.
Obviously I cannot answer all of the questions, Mr President, because time is pressing. I simply wish to say that this Stockholm Programme is, as Mrs Ask said, very pragmatic, that it will thus lend itself to an action plan that the Spanish Presidency is going to implement, and you, ladies and gentlemen, are henceforth going to be colegislators. I certainly see this as a powerful means of driving forward this area of freedom, security and justice that the citizens so very much want.
The defence and promotion of human rights have seen a decline in their importance on the EU agenda in recent years, with Member States' security becoming the political priority. The EU's area of freedom, security and justice is entering a decisive phase. The Treaty of Maastricht introduced aspects relating to justice and internal affairs at Community level, which had been dealt with strictly at intergovernmental level until then. The Tampere and the Hague Programmes provided major political impetus in consolidating these policies. The Stockholm Multiannual Programme, in turn, sets out priorities for the next five years so that the benefits of an area of freedom, security and justice become a reality for citizens. The programme will be implemented after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force. By introducing the codecision procedures as an ordinary legislative procedure, Europe's justice and internal affairs policies and the measures adopted to comply with them will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
in writing. - (HU) During the drafting of the Stockholm Programme, our aim was to make Europe's citizens aware of the tangible benefits of an area of freedom, security and justice. However, creating a Europe for its citizens goes far beyond simply drafting a programme. The Treaty of Lisbon opens up a new dimension for citizens to assert their interests. The rights, freedoms and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights are given binding force. The European Union can now sign up to the Council of Europe's agreement on the protection of human rights. This legal act must come into force as soon as possible. We need to have a clear implementation plan for fulfilling these commitments so that the new legal structures available are given proper substance.
These are certainly useful measures, since the basic principles of human rights require constant attention, and we still have a great deal to do in this area in the EU as well. The growth in discrimination and intolerance are increasingly serious social problems. National and ethnic minorities, especially the Roma, gays and people with disabilities, face some form of discrimination every day. It is therefore important for every Member State to implement existing directives consistently and for the Council to extend protection to every group at risk by accepting the new, comprehensive draft directive.
As a consequence of the economic crisis, there is a rise in racism and xenophobia, as well as in the number of crimes caused by these problems. According to the Fundamental Rights Agency, the statistics do not give a true picture of the real situation, as in most cases, the victims are not aware of their rights and do not go to the authorities. It is the joint responsibility of the EU's institutions and Member States to change this situation. We must draft regulations at European level capable of ensuring that Europe and its Member States continue to protect diversity and do not leave any scope for violence.
The Stockholm Programme obliges the European Commission to present a proposal for accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights. This is an important and significant step, which will allow us to develop a uniform, minimum level of protection of fundamental rights in Europe. Thanks to accession to the convention, EU institutions will be subject to external, independent supervision in terms of conformity of the legislation and activities of the EU with the European Convention on Human Rights. At the same time, the EU will be able to defend its position before the European Court of Human Rights. This will eliminate the possibility of discrepancies arising between decisions of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.
In reference to point 16 of the motion for a resolution, I appeal for a prompt commencement of negotiations on accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. In the context of the resolution under discussion, I call for the immediate withdrawal of Poland from the Protocol on the Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to Poland and to the United Kingdom. With the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will apply to all measures undertaken concerning the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice. It is disgraceful that the right-wing authorities in the Republic of Poland, by succumbing to pressure from the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, are denying Poles rights to which they are entitled. The citizens of Poland should be able to enjoy these rights in the same way that the citizens of other EU Member States enjoy them. If we do not want Poles to be second-class citizens in the EU, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be adopted in its entirety.
An important part of the Stockholm Programme concerns the increased protection of disadvantaged groups at risk. The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is inconceivable without a ban on all forms of discrimination. However, a ban does not go far enough. The European Union must take specific action against any discriminatory measures, as this is the only possible way of properly serving all Europe's citizens in this area. I would like to mention just one of these discriminatory measures, which affects traditional national minorities. Linguistic genocide is going on in two EU countries as well at the moment. This is why I am asking the European Council and the future Spanish Presidency to devote greater attention to preventing discriminatory measures during the implementation of the Stockholm Programme. Otherwise, this programme will not serve the interests of every EU citizen, but only those of the members of the majority peoples.
The EU's cooperation in the area of migration has developed quickly over the last few years and includes a number of different legislative acts and other types of measures. With regard to the rights of asylum seekers, I would like to draw your attention to the basic aim of cooperation on asylum. The goal of this work is to create a common European asylum system that will provide people with protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and other international treaties relating to people in need of protection. Within the framework of this cooperation, there are provisions for being able to offer subsidiary protection and provisions relating to the asylum procedure, reception and return. The provisions cover the whole asylum area and form the basis of the common European asylum system.
Well-managed migration involves both creating opportunities for people to lawfully enter the European Union and being able to send back those who do not fulfil the conditions for entry to, and presence in, the territory or who have no grounds for asylum. With regard to the fundamental rights of those who do not have the right to stay within the Union, I would like to refer, firstly, to the general legal principles that must form the basis for all of the EU's activities and, secondly and more specifically, to the rules that apply to the return of third-country nationals who do not have the right to enter and stay legally in a Member State. These rules are laid down in the Return Directive, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2008. The directive is the first important step towards legislation that aims to provide justice and transparent procedures to achieve a more effective policy on return at European level. One fundamental principle for the work relating to return is that it must have legal certainty and be humane and efficient.
The work relating to return also includes provisions on joint removal flights. The Council Decision on the organisation of joint flights for removals of third-country nationals who have not been granted a residence permit or asylum was adopted in 2002 within the framework of the return action programme. The arrangement of joint flights is an efficient use of resources and helps to improve the operational cooperation between Member States. However, I would like to emphasise that it is not about enforcing collective deportation decisions. It is a cooperative measure designed to utilise the capacity of the Member States more efficiently. The common guidelines that accompanied the Council Decision state that joint flights can be organised for persons who do not or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry to, presence in or residence on the territory of a Member State of the European Union. The organising Member State and each participating Member State shall ensure that the legal situation of each and every one of the returnees for which they are responsible allows for removal.
All of these measures are intended to ensure that international protection is available for those who need it and that the return of third-country nationals who are unlawfully present within the EU is carried out in a legally certain and lawful manner. The use of joint flights for removals does not entail the violation of the principle of non-refoulement or the circumvention of the requirement for cases to be examined on an individual basis. The Member States are expected to take account of the particular circumstances of each person who is the subject of removal, including any application for international protection. This, of course, also applies to people who have come from Afghanistan.
Mr President, honourable Members, the Community policy for removal is, of course, important, but it is only one aspect of a comprehensive migration policy. The European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which was adopted by the European Council in September of last year, confirms the Union's commitments to the global approach to migration. This means that migration issues should be an integrated part of the EU's external relations and that efficient management of migration must be uniform. This also requires a close partnership between the countries of origin, transit and destination.
European legislation obliges the Member States to ensure that third-country nationals present on their territory can request international protection if they so desire. With regard to the possibility of these nationals, Afghans in this case, being granted one form or another of international protection, the Member States must examine each asylum application by applying the criteria laid down by European legislation to the specific individual circumstances of each asylum seeker. The Member States must decide whether the asylum seeker can claim refugee status and, if he does not meet the criteria required to be considered a refugee, they must verify whether he can receive so-called subsidiary protection.
I am going to run through the principles. Firstly, third-country nationals must not be sent back to their country if they are at risk of serious attacks. European Union legislation and, more specifically, the Asylum Qualification Directive, states that the Member States must respect the principle of non-refoulement, in accordance with their international obligations. Therefore, Member States cannot send back to Afghanistan persons who are refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention or who have been granted subsidiary protection. Moreover, the Member States are bound to ensure that no return operations are carried out in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which obliges the Member States to guarantee that a person will not be sent back to his country if he is liable to suffer persecution or serious attack upon his return.
It should also be noted that, although the Return Directive has not yet been transposed by the majority of the Member States, the Commission encourages them to ensure, at this time, that their return decisions comply with the rules laid down by this directive. This means, in particular, that priority must be given to voluntary returns, that the right to appeal against return decisions must be provided for and that the individual needs of vulnerable persons must be taken into account. This Return Directive is not yet in force. It will be soon, and it will enable some additional guarantees to be given to the persons concerned.
That being said, those are the answers, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that I wished to provide, in line with European law. Of course, Mr Billström also explained that, with regard to all of these problems, we are trying to strike the right balance between the desire to accommodate those who are persecuted for political reasons and who genuinely deserve to be protected, and then, at the same time, the need to recognise also that some applications have no reason to be accepted. So there is a difficult balance there, which the Commission is monitoring closely.
Questions have already been asked. Is Afghanistan a safe country? Well, we should ask Mr Obama that, as he has just decided to send 34 000 soldiers there. No army is able to guarantee the survival of its men in Afghanistan, and are we supposed to be able to guarantee that the lives of the migrants that we send back to that country will not be endangered? This situation is a joke, and the UNHCR is not putting up with it either, as it has warmly recommended to the Member States that they do not proceed with deportations of this kind.
I am sorry, Mr Barrot, but the legislation in question is as much European legislation as it is national legislation, and please do not refer us to every single one of the national situations. A large proportion of the situations thus brought about are due to the Return Directive, which I prefer to call the 'Shame' Directive, because it is a directive of shame as far as all human rights defenders are concerned. You know that asylum seekers are treated very differently in each of the European countries and, precisely because of these differences, Afghans are unable to seek asylum in good conditions.
What is worrying this House and me is that the situation regarding security in Afghanistan is such that we do not know whether anyone can be returned there. In Finland, for example, this situation has been resolved by issuing temporary residence permits, even though the personal definitions for refugee status have not been met - so asylum has not been granted - because we do not want to return people to a country at war. The security situation in Afghanistan is too dangerous to return anyone there at present, but afterwards, when things have quietened down, these people will be returned.
(PL) Mr President, I want to begin with the following matter - I worked for several years in the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland, and in connection with this, I have been to Afghanistan many times, because 2 000 soldiers from Poland are serving there. The drama of the situation concerns the fact that, on the one hand, there are people there who are desperate, who cannot cope in such a difficult situation, because all the time there is a war going on around them. On the other hand, there are people there who, and I do not hesitate to say this, are playing on two sides. During the day they support those who are, today, in power, and at night they help the Taliban. In relation to this, my basic question is as follows: do we have the instruments and the capability to evaluate the real intentions and situations of those who come to Europe? I think that some come simply because they do not see another way out, and because they are desperate, but there may also be individual cases of people playing on several sides.
Mr President, I found part of the discussion a bit strange. Why are the people here illegally? They are here illegally because there is no way that they can get out of their country, which is at war, in a legal way. There is no way they can get here legally, so it is not really surprising that we find them coming here illegally. We all know how difficult it is to apply for and to get asylum since the Geneva Convention is pretty strict on this and you have to prove that you are personally persecuted which, of course, is difficult when you are fleeing from war. Now you are saying that just because they did not get their asylum claim through, we should send them back to Afghanistan, where there is war and where people cannot live, where they cannot survive, where there is no way of earning a living and where there is, by the way, also a strong war against women. So, just on this last ground, all the women fleeing from there should be given asylum.
Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for your many interesting contributions to this debate. I would like to start by attempting to sum up some of the most important principles in this matter. I will begin with what Mrs Mathieu said in her first point about the issue of mixed migration flows. It is indeed the case that we have mixed flows coming to the European Union and as the Union does not have unlimited capacity to accept these people, as Mrs Mathieu pointed out, it is important to carry out an individual, legally certain assessment in order to be able to determine who should receive protection in accordance with European legislation and international conventions. The Commission monitors this by means of the directives that have been adopted unanimously within the Union.
That leads me nicely on to the views expressed earlier by Mrs Guillaume and Mrs de Sarnez, namely whether Afghanistan is a country in which it is possible to guarantee an individual's safety. Well, yes, that is precisely what this entire debate is about! That is exactly what an individual review aims to clarify and ensure. The purpose of the establishment of a common European asylum system is to achieve this aim. I think that several of the speakers completely overlooked this fact in their speeches, in other words, that a legally certain review, with the purpose of clarifying that 'yes' means 'yes' and 'no' means 'no', is what we must endeavour to achieve. In the case of a 'no', the person must be returned, irrespective - and I will repeat this so that everyone understands precisely what the Presidency's intentions are - of the country concerned. If we have clarified and ensured that a person is not in need of special protection, we can send them back to their country of origin with a clear conscience. Whether this is done, as Commissioner Barrot said, in a coordinated way on a flight with several different people on board whose cases have all been reviewed individually, or whether they travel separately, is actually of secondary importance. It is merely a question of logistics in this context.
I will now turn to Mrs Keller, who always brings interesting arguments to these matters. Yes, I share your view that the question of access is a complicated one. It is difficult when we currently have a system which, in principle, requires someone to be present within the European Union in order to submit an application for asylum, while at the same time, it is perhaps not always particularly easy for them to get to the European Union in order to do this. However, this is precisely why, during the Swedish Presidency, we have pressed on with the work to set up a common European resettlement system, which will make it possible to offer an alternative route, a passage, within the European Union for those who are perhaps the most in need of protection, the most vulnerable and the people who do not have the financial resources to travel to the European Union.
Let me say that if all of the EU Member States could provide as many places as Sweden is currently doing - we have 1 900 places annually - in relation to the size of their populations, the European Union would be able to provide 100 000 places annually to UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It is a major strategic step to be able to close the worst refugee camps around the world and stand up and show the solidarity that we in the Presidency believe that the European Union should be showing to the countries outside our borders which, in fact, contain most of the world's refugees.
What I would also like to say to you is that, regarding this idea of a safe country, there is Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights case-law that says that the simple fact of coming from a country or a region in which there is unrest is not reason enough to justify absolute protection against deportation or the right to subsidiary protection, except in exceptional cases in which the level of general violence is so high that anyone is in real danger of suffering threats to their life or their person simply as a result of being in the country or the region concerned. Moreover, it is true that these exceptional circumstances were not cited in the case in point.
That being said, I would also like to respond on the matter of group flights. It must be said that Frontex has already organised group flights and has partly financed those flights. I believe that this must indeed be said. There were such flights in 2008 and in 2009, so they are nothing new. What Frontex is trying to do - and I believe that the director of Frontex is succeeding in this - is to ensure that group repatriations are carried out in decent conditions, where people are respected. The director of Frontex was even telling me recently that he had observed that, in Austria, there was an ombudsman who was specifically monitoring the conditions in which these returns were conducted.
Above all, I would like to remind you - and here I thank Mr Billström and the Swedish Presidency, which has helped us greatly - that, in spring, we began to table texts that are going to help us move towards a Europe of asylum. We have a text on reception conditions, we have reviewed - and Mrs De Sarnez rightly raised this point - the Dublin problem, we have, in fact, raised the issue of adapting the Dublin regulation precisely in order to prevent it from undermining, at times, the interests of vulnerable persons and particularly of children, and we have endorsed the principle of introducing certain derogations from the Dublin regulation.
I wish to thank the Swedish Presidency. It has, I believe, done a good job of presenting these various texts to the Council, but they are still a long way away from being adopted. And we have some problems. I am doing everything in my power to try to get this Europe of asylum up and running, with the help of the Swedish Presidency, which has set an example - Mr Billström pointed out, moreover, just how much of an example his country had set in Europe. With regard to this problem, too, the Member States are showing more solidarity when it comes to receiving these refugees and guaranteeing their protection. All of the countries need to starting doing this. We are not there yet, and there are still some countries that do not receive refugees.
Thank you, Mr President. Seven months ago - on 23 April to be precise - a large majority in this House refused to grant discharge to the Council's budget for 2007. Why? It was because the Council's behaviour in respect of Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control was completely unacceptable. The Council refused to answer written questions that we put to it about its budget and refused to meet with the Committee on Budgetary Control and answer questions. The situation was so absurd that representatives of the Council immediately left any meeting at which questions concerning the Council's budget were asked.
In reality, this was nothing new. It had, in fact, been going on for many years. What was new was that in April, Parliament put a stop to it. I think that in April, most Members asked themselves a simple question: how can I, as a Member of the European Parliament, be responsible to my voters for the Council's budget if the Council will not even answer the questions put to it by Parliament? I believe that this was the question that resulted in a large majority of Members of this House refusing to grant discharge for the Council's budget. Perhaps some people thought that Parliament would become more amenable after the elections in June, or that Parliament's demands for openness and transparency smacked of election promises rather than a real change of attitude. If so, they will have been disappointed.
Even after the election, we on the Committee on Budgetary Control have been united in our very simple stance: if the Council wishes us to grant discharge for its budget, then it must meet with us and answer our questions. At the end of September, something finally happened. On 24 September, a meeting was held between the Council and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the committee's rapporteurs and the coordinators. At the same time, the Council answered the committee's questions - albeit indirectly - and these answers were also published on the Council's website.
As regards the specific issue of this particular report on discharge in respect of the 2007 budget, I would like to express my satisfaction that you are now recommending that the Council be granted discharge. If we look closer at the main issues, there is actually no reason not to grant discharge. The Council has always endeavoured to follow the rules and to apply openness with regard to economic management. This will be the case in future, too. I understood that the informal meeting in September between the delegation from the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Council delegation enabled a number of points to be clarified and that this was what made it possible - as the rapporteur also mentioned - to grant discharge to the Council for the 2007 budget.
All's well that ends well, as we say in Germany? No, not this time. The discharge procedure with the Council has shown itself to be ineffable and in urgent need of a place on the interinstitutional agenda, which, incidentally, needs to be extended to include the President of the European Council. We have a new player on the European stage, and the existing procedure cannot, and must not, continue as it is. The way that Parliament has to beg for information and dialogue partners in order to get answers for its outstanding questions is unworthy of a parliamentary democracy. The Council styles itself as the ultimate and absolutist body and I, as a citizen of the European Union, stand before the voters of my constituency ashamed of this behaviour. The procedure that we have had so far is simply absurd and it must not be allowed to carry on in future.
I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency once again. We have made interesting beginnings. Firstly, there was this conversation, a new and unprecedented milestone, and the fact that you are present here today is a fantastic signal. The Presidency of the Council, like all the other EU institutions, must put itself forward for discharge by Parliament, and the same applies, now more than ever, of course, to the new High Representative, as head of the new External Action Service. We MEPs must now show that this issue is important to us and that we have to drive it forwards together. This issue must be on every agenda, and I would like to ask the Commission to put it on the agenda.
We do not like how the debate has been going so far. The fact that we have nothing, not one single proposal, for how things should be in the future, disturbs us. Lisbon must not become a synonym for an opaque European Union in which parliamentary supervision has been steamrollered. It is an opportunity for a new beginning with strong participation on the part of the elected representatives of the people, and the granting of discharge for the future President of the European Council is the first acid test.
Mrs Malmström, I agree with you that it is good that the principles of transparency are being observed, including financial transparency, but I agree with those remarks which speak about something more. We have, today, reached a crucial moment in the way we operate. On the eve of the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Council is acknowledging, as it were, that Parliament is the only body which is elected because Parliament works openly. For Parliament and the Council to be compatible bodies, the Council, too, should, to a great extent, work more openly, and that is exactly what is happening at the moment. We are overcoming the Council's aversion to working with Parliament. I think this is going to happen not only in this area of our work, but that it is also going to happen in other areas of our work, including the parliamentary committees.
The Council is actually continuing to hide behind a kind of gentlemen's agreement concluded at some point in the early 1970s - forty years ago - whereby Parliament and the Council agreed not to interfere in each other's budgets, not to look into each other's books and to let everything pass, like respectable gentlemen. This is a thing of the past, as the Council budget has changed fundamentally. Forty years ago, it consisted of nothing but administrative expenditure, whereas now operational expenditure has been added. Therefore, we must strive towards a breakthrough.
We have broken the deadlock provisionally. We are prepared to grant discharge, but now we really must go a step further. After all, the problems have not been solved. We have the task of ensuring that transparency and democratic control apply to the Council's budget and also to the budget of our own Parliament. Therefore, I agree with all those - speakers, rapporteur, speakers from the political groups - who have said clearly: look, this is a warning shot, we must go a step further in the next Council discharge exercise. The Annual Report of the Court of Auditors contains suggestions in this regard, and once again mentions matters concerning the SESAME Programme. Mrs Malmström, you may soon no longer be involved, but we are going to continue pushing for transparency.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, we are elected Members of the European Parliament, but our voters do not know what is going on behind the scenes. In April 2009, the Budgetary Control Committee decided to postpone discharge to the Council. Even if the Court of Auditors had not criticised the accounts, the Committee claimed to have enough reasons to proceed that way. However, after this Committee met with the Swedish Presidency in September, and some written answers were given to Parliament's questions, Mr Søndergaard, the rapporteur on the Council discharge for 2007, still issued a report which, even with much goodwill, would not have allowed discharge to be given. However, a political decision was taken to give discharge and the compromising paragraphs were watered down.
The Committee intends to recommend discharge on expectations for the future. If the people who bothered to vote for us in June knew the following: that there is a consensus not to rock the boat on the basis of a gentleman's agreement from 1970; that the internal auditor of the Council would not be invited to the Budgetary Control Committee because then, the Council would be able to invite the internal auditor of the European Parliament, with uncertain consequences; and that the politically appointed Court of Auditors did not have any comments on the Council's internal auditor's report of April 2008, what would they say?
Back in 2002, when I was Chief Accountant of the European Commission, the then Director-General for Budgets stated, in a letter to the then internal auditor of the Commission, that the discharge procedure was an interinstitutional game and nothing more. Are we going to continue to avoid talking about the gorilla in the middle of the room because we are afraid to lose privileges obtained after years of silence? We can choose to expose and end hypocrisy when we vote for the 2007 Council discharge. I think you know what I choose, and I hope that you will join me in refusing discharge to the Council.
Last spring, extra-budgetary accounts suddenly emerged and the Council was not granted discharge. Four reasons were cited for this. The first was that the Council refused to accept any kind of official, formal meeting with Parliament. The second was that the Council refused to provide any comprehensive written answers. The third was that the Council failed to supply either an activity report or a complete list of budgetary transfers. The fourth reason was that it is impossible to determine whether the expenditure items in the Council budget are of an operational nature.
I would remind the rapporteur that his initial report put a total of twenty queries and questions to the Council. Yet where are the precise answers to these questions? Can you tell me that? No, you cannot. Instead of increasing the pressure on the Council at this point, what do we do? We turn ourselves into supplicants, and these demands become requests in the new report. Anyone who votes in favour of granting discharge to the Council now will be giving their support to precisely this situation, where Parliament stands before the Council making meek requests.
I would like to draw attention to several matters, which are still, however, outstanding, and which are something which we must tackle in the next few years. The difficult and laborious process of granting discharge to the Council shows what the European Parliament wants. The European Parliament wants transparency, and open but also formal dialogue with the Council. These demands of the European Parliament are persistent and stubborn, but they are not an expression of malice on the part of MEPs, they are an expression of concern for public money and are, as indeed they should be, an expression of concern for transparency in spending taxpayers' money.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Søndergaard for his successful work, as a result of which the Council ultimately accommodated Parliament in the discharge procedure. The Council refused, for a long while, to provide pertinent answers to Parliament's questions, citing the Gentlemen's Agreement - an agreement of an informal nature which is now, in any case, 40 years old. This seems downright bizarre when Council officials, after 40 years, clearly no longer know what exactly the Gentlemen's Agreement states, since the version provided by the European Parliament contains precisely the opposite of what the Council claimed again and again in the negotiations.
The first resolution of the Gentleman's Agreement stated that the Council would not attempt to make any changes to the European Parliament's expenditure. The third resolution states that there should be close cooperation between the two institutions on budget issues. The Council takes this to mean that each institution will leave the budgetary activity of the other alone. At this point, I will refrain from commenting on the seriousness of this line of argument. Instead, I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency of the Council for having begun the process of bringing an end to this ignoble state of affairs.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, first of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency of the Council is present, and I would also like to personally thank Mrs Malmström for having made the procedure more transparent. Everything that my fellow Members have said is true - the procedure is more transparent, and even if she expressed herself in a somewhat more cautious manner today, we can still say that we will be granting discharge. There is still a very long way to go. We ask the Council to follow this first step with further steps, especially given that the Council's competences in the field of foreign and security policy have been much more clearly defined under the Treaty of Lisbon. In future, this policy will also have a face, in the shape of Baroness Ashton. The citizens, however, did not previously know Baroness Ashton, and they, the European taxpayers, will still not know, in future, exactly how much money she has at her disposal and what she does with it. We must change this state of affairs. This, indeed, is an absolute must in a time where we are actually fighting for a transparent, democratic Europe.
I believe that since Parliament's refusal to give discharge to the Council, many efforts have been made. In particular, we have welcomed the publication on the Council's website of its annual activity report and the increased level of transparency in the common foreign and security policy sector. We also welcomed the meeting in September at which, finally, there was a constructive discussion between the representatives of the Committee on Budgets and those of the Swedish Presidency. The efforts made by the Council to supply appropriate replies to the requests made by Parliament in April are equally welcome.
Mr President, thank you for debating this extremely important matter. I am pleased that we agree on the importance of openness and transparency. These things are, of course, the foundation not only of constructive cooperation between us, but also for enabling citizens to have confidence in the European institutions. Like Parliament, the Council is keen to accept its responsibility for guaranteeing the greatest possible transparency when it comes to taxpayers' money, and these issues become even more relevant, of course, with the new treaty, which will enter into force in just one week's time.
The broader discussion of the form that the auditing of the Union's financial management is to take should be carried out in connection with the review of the regulations and the annual procedure for the EU's budget that will be necessary on account of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. However, the Council endeavours, and will continue to endeavour, to follow the rules and to apply openness with regard to its economic management. In relation to the European Parliament, we will continue to apply the practice established over the years and also next year hold talks with Parliament on an informal basis to clear up any questions there may be about the implementation of the budget. In this connection, I look forward to continuing the dialogue with the European Parliament on the question of discharge and I am certain that we will also have a constructive, informal dialogue next year on the Court of Auditors' report for 2008. Thank you very much for this debate.
We have come a step closer, however. When we start on the 2008 discharge - and we are doing that even now - we will not be starting from a blank sheet. We will be starting from the point we have reached this year. I therefore believe it is right to defend what we have achieved by voting in favour, thereby continuing this struggle - which is, after all, what it is. Time will tell - when we see how things go this year and next year and the year after that - whether we made the right decision. That is why it is crucial that we as a committee, and as Parliament, are capable of standing together and sticking to what we set out to do all along.
in writing. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, who has done an exceptional job, directly raised crucial questions and insisted on the need for us to obtain clear answers before proceeding to recommend discharge. Congratulations also to the Committee on Budgetary Control, which stood by its position and supported the rapporteur and, despite initial difficulties, managed to persuade the Council to give us answers to the most important questions. For how can we recommend discharge for a budget, how can we responsibly argue that the budget in question is correct, without knowing what is behind the numbers? That would be completely absurd. Following the Council's replies, we are now ready to recommend discharge but, at the same time, we have included substantial comments in the accompanying resolution, which the Committee on Budgetary Control approved with a very large majority. We want and believe in open procedures, we want and believe in transparency and we want to have full knowledge of how European taxpayers' money is spent.
Indeed, the report on the current first rail package, adopted by the Commission in 2006, and the latest statistics indicate that the opening up of the market to competition has not had any negative impact on the overall level of rail safety which, on the contrary, continues to improve. We must, however, be vigilant to ensure that this improvement continues, and we certainly cannot settle for the results already obtained. Liberalisation, in fact, means that the number of operators on our networks is continuing to grow, and we must therefore continually assess the quality of the operators present.
In order to eliminate these barriers, in 2008, the Railway Agency began work on the cross-acceptance of rolling stock. In this connection, the agency is classifying all national standards on the basis of a harmonised list of technical parameters, before moving on to a comparison of the standards in the various Member States in order to establish the degree of equivalence. The goal is to do away with the practice, common in the railway sector, of resorting to national standards to obstruct the approval of rolling stock already approved by other States.
In my opinion, it must be ensured that the national safety authorities issue their safety certificates and authorisations in accordance with what is laid down by the European Railway Agency (ERA). Are there adequate controls? Is it ensured, for example, that the training of the staff, the certifications and the working conditions are properly monitored? What is the situation, in this regard, with respect to the introduction of a standardised Community certification? What is the situation with regard to the European train driver's licence? The efforts with regard to the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) must also be redoubled.
Many of the most recent railway accidents and near-misses have been due to maintenance failings. The intensity, in particular, is being neglected on cost grounds, and maintenance intervals are being lengthened. What is the situation with regard to a Europe-wide certification system for maintenance works? I believe that everything possible must be done to prevent each individual Member State from turning back to its old rules and acting independently and in diverging ways. The border crossings between the individual Member States, in particular, represent a safety risk. How does the Commission intend to overcome this problem in the short term? I would also like to ask you to ensure that, when you make your evaluation, you do not forget the social aspects - they need to be taken into account.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Simpson just for asking his question, and to congratulate him, because his question has become the subject of our debate. It is a very late debate, at a late hour in the evening, but it is very good that we are having this debate. When the subject of the question was shown, we saw the words: context - the European railroad system. I venture to suggest here that at the moment, we still do not have a European railroad system.
Why not? Every railroad has its own technical standards. If they are electric railroads, it is either DC or AC. If it is AC, it is either 15 kV, or 30 kV, or 35 kV. I can tell you an interesting fact, which is especially appropriate in the presence of Mr Tajani. In the North-South system, there are two railroads which are similar - the one in Poland and the one in Italy. All of the others have differences between them. Therefore, Mr President, let us give the railroads a chance. Let us establish a truly European railroad system, even if this has to be done in spite of the almighty, national railroad carriers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to prepare for rail competition, the European directives have imposed the separation of the rail network and transport activities, thus prohibiting any kind of standardisation. The result: trains in France travel more slowly on the secondary network today than they did at the start of the 20th century. A third of the network is going to ruin through lack of resources to maintain it. All the railway unions, all the experts say that this situation will inevitably result in terrible accidents.
(DE) Mr President, it is not actually astonishing. There is one thing that we can say, and that is that, where liberalisation and privatisation takes place, the numbers of accidents and incidents increase. The reason is obvious, as where there is a need to generate high profits, there are poorly paid employees; there is poorer training and gaining of qualifications, as this is costly; there are fewer controls, as controls cost money; and ultimately - we have seen this everywhere - when everything goes wrong, there are incredible costs involved for the public in clearing up the mess caused by liberalisation and privatisation.
The real issue is that I believe the Commission ought to initiate a more rigorous phase based around a more strategic role for the European Railway Agency. It ought to take on a role of greater coordination, control and supervision over the national safety agencies, and it ought to do so in a much speedier manner precisely because of the differences between the various countries, which my fellow Members have already alluded to, regarding contradictions between national and European legislation. In my view, there are huge delays on this aspect.
As you are well aware, the European Commission has invited Member States to consider teaching regional and minority languages as part of their national strategies for promoting multilingualism in society. The decisions made by the European Union in this area are not replacing the measures already adopted by Member States, but are intended to support and supplement them. The main funding instruments available to the European Union are the Lifelong Learning Programme for the 2007-2013 period, which is open to all the languages spoken in the Community, including regional and minority languages.
As you know, the provisions of the Charter are aimed at the EU's institutions and bodies, as well as Member States, only when they implement Community legislation. Consequently, Member States continue to be the decision makers on their domestic linguistic policy, including with regard to regional and minority languages. The protection of persons belonging to national minorities is an integral part of respecting human rights, which is one of the principles on which the European Union has been created, as indicated in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
As a result, Member States should use every legal instrument they have available to safeguard the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, in accordance with their own constitutional order and with the obligations and commitments incumbent upon them under international law. By international law I mean, for example, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe, which provides a global framework in this area, as well as the recommendations from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which the European Union has resorted to on different occasions.
The languages of Europe's peoples as a cultural whole form the cultural heritage of Europe, just as the Commissioner has also said. I thank him for making this point. There are no differences between languages, whether they are spoken by a minority or majority. At the same time, people's right to use their own language is an integral part of their basic rights, as is also stated in Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is no coincidence that national communities are extremely sensitive about any infringement of their rights in this area.
I am speaking out, on behalf of a minority numbering more than half a million, against Slovakia's national language law containing certain articles which infringe and restrict the rights of this minority. Let me give you a few examples. Article 8(4) of the law stipulates that doctors must communicate in the national language with patients in locations where the minority's proportion is less than 20%. This also applies to social workers and their clients, as well as to fire-fighters and paramedics, if they are on duty, in other words, when putting out a fire or taking someone to hospital. According to Article 6(1), Slovak must be used in the text of adverts, whether public or private. According to Article 8(6), adverts must appear first and larger in the national language, or the letters must be at least as big as those in the text in the second language. This obviously conveys the message that the first language is more important, while the second is subordinate and second-class.
Mrs Bauer, you were critical of the language law. The language law is not as good as it might be, that has indeed been established. It does not infringe fundamental rights, however. That too must be stated. That being the case, there is a need to work on eliminating those deficiencies that do exist - above all, in the interpretation of the law. It is absolutely crucial that a signal be sent from this debate today that we are making improvements not because we want to play off one population group against the other but because we want the relations between Slovaks and Hungarians within Slovakia, and of course, also between the two countries, to improve. That must be our concern. Especially now, as we approach the elections, I can but call for moderation, reason and dialogue, which offer the road to a positive result.
Just as there is a Hungarian minority in Slovakia, so there is also a Slovak minority in many a municipality with a Hungarian majority within Slovakia. We must therefore bring these elements together. The second signal sent from this debate is also a crucial factor. Together, we have a range of problems. Slovakia and Hungary, too, have problems together, such as the problem of the Romani. Would it not, then, be much more sensible to concentrate on solving these existing problems together via dialogue, in an effort to give all the minorities of this region a better chance? In the end, we are all members of minorities. The aim must be that we clearly commit ourselves to linguistic diversity - as the Commissioner said - to promoting multilingualism, since languages are an 'asset'. People who can speak additional languages have an advantage, and when everyone understands that and accepts it, we will be able to look forward to a better future.
On the other hand, as of 1 December, we shall have a clause in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union stating that the Union is founded on the values of respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. This probably cannot be a solid legal ground for immediately building our own minority rights concept in the acquis communautaire. Nevertheless, we deserve a statement today that is more focused on the Commission's political stance regarding minority rights and the message must, in my opinion, be very simple. A party that acts against the rights of persons belonging to minorities, including linguistic rights, acts against the core values of the Union.
The Slovak language does not wish to develop at the expense of other languages. Precisely for this reason, it is incomprehensible that a law dealing with the use of ethnic minority languages defines for them a much narrower range of use than for Slovak. This law in fact only treats the use of these languages as an option, and it views this option only in a negative way and not as a positive right, failing to regard it as a right that can be demanded and applied in everyday life.
Slovakia is a mature, grown-up and self-confident democratic country and is not dependent on cultural warfare, or on the use of law to defend itself against indigenous languages. The indigenous ethnic groups do not threaten Slovak nationhood, the Slovak language or the culture of the Slovak nation. On the contrary, the coexisting ethnic groups will enthusiastically and voluntarily protect, support and develop the Slovak language and its culture as long as there is a visible willingness on the part of the Slovak nation to protect, support and develop the languages and culture of the ethnic minorities.
I would like to deliver a lecture on how they seem to have forgotten to look at themselves and how in Hungary, they restrict minorities in the use of their native languages. Let us take a look, for example, at the upbringing of children and at schools. The Slovak Republic allows Hungarian children to be educated in their native language from primary school to secondary school to university. The teaching of all subjects is carried out by Hungarian speaking teachers in Hungarian. On the other hand, Slovak children in Hungary can only dream of having Slovak schools. The Hungarian Government closed them down in 1961. Since then, children from ethnic minorities in Hungary have had nowhere to learn the correct usage of their native languages as the Hungarian Government does not afford them the opportunity of being educated in their native languages, in contrast to other EU governments. In Hungary, Slovak children must therefore study all subjects in Hungarian and their native language is added as something like a punishment, as extra work, with the intention of putting them off. They are taught Slovak by Hungarian speaking teachers who are not proficient in the Slovak language. In this way, the relationship of the children to their native language and their cultural links are suppressed and derailed.
(HU) Right at the start of this item, we need to clarify what we can consider of value to the European Union. Is it what is written in documents, or is something of value when states respect it or, if not, the European Union makes them respect it? Can a national minority be regarded as something of value? Does it matter? Well, in the Czech Republic, the Beneš Decrees have currently been left in force so that Václav Klaus will sign the Treaty of Lisbon. In other words, they have maintained the stigma of collective guilt for the Sudeten German and Hungarian ethnic groups. Is a minority of value then? Is a minority language of value? In Slovakia, the indigenous Hungarian population are punished if they use their mother tongue. This law simply cannot be implemented properly. Europe should be ashamed as long as this law exists. This should not be a dispute between Slovakia and Hungary. It should be an issue to be resolved between the European Union safeguarding its values and Slovakia. It is a hypocritical system that proclaims these values but does not comply with them in practice.
I wish to thank Commissioner Orban in particular for mentioning the Council of Europe's Charter for Regional or Minority Languages among the rights and useful documents he referred to. Similarly, I think that it is especially important that Mr Buzek visited Bratislava and issued a clear statement on this matter. After all, all of us who have been dealing with human rights in this Chamber for years feel that it is outrageous that, as the Treaty of Lisbon dawns, citizens belonging to a minority are not allowed to use their own mother tongue in the land of their birth and cannot enjoy the rights guaranteed by democracy. Indeed, the law makes it a possible criminal offence for someone to exercise the fundamental human right to use their mother tongue. This implies that the minority are second-class citizens in their homeland. We are talking, Mr Paška, about 530 000 Hungarians in Slovakia and 20-30 000 Slovaks in Hungary, just to give you a comparison.
However, I would simply like to reply to Mr Swoboda that a minority is fighting in this case for its most basic human right against the majority. It is not two countries fighting against each other. The European Union must intervene without fail and speak out against the Slovak and any other such law which jeopardises the use of minority languages and the protection of minorities' identity as such laws contravene every international document, including the basic principles now reinforced in the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Hungarian Members here are attacking the Slovak language law. Their assertions constitute the naked lies, fabrications and figments of injured Hungarian nationalism. We must reject this, ladies and gentlemen. On the contrary, the Slovak language law conforms fully with international standards, as confirmed by the most competent observer - Commissioner Vollebæk of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Our language law contributes to the elimination of discrimination against minorities and to the safety and health of our citizens while creating a space for their full integration. Moreover, Slovakia has signed the Minority Languages Charter and thus maintains the linguistic diversity of all minorities in Slovakia to a high degree.
(PL) Mr President, I am pleased that, as a Member from Lithuania, I can speak here in Polish, my mother tongue. I think this privilege should be the norm not only in the European Parliament, but in all countries of the EU, because multiculturality and linguistic diversity are very important in the European hierarchy of values. We should make every effort to ensure that national minorities, and especially indigenous minorities, do not feel any discrimination in the matters covered by today's Commission statement. Therefore, the Commission has before it the urgent task of resolving conflicts concerning the use of minority languages in all the countries of the EU, without exception. The positive solutions found to these problems in Finland, Italy, Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic and many other countries clearly facilitate this task. We only need effective and, more importantly, immediate action of the Commission on this matter.
There are such languages in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Estonia, Cyprus, Spain, Sweden, and Finland, and the list goes on. This would mean, Mr President, that we would have to use 35 or 40 languages in plenary, which in financial and logistical terms, is simply unviable. Therefore, Mr President, insisting on this might bring electoral benefits, but it certainly makes absolutely no sense and is entirely unrealistic. It would only help to generate pointless frustration for many loyal citizens.
First of all, it discriminates on ethnic grounds by relegating the half a million-strong Hungarian community to second-class citizens and their mother tongue to a second-class language. Secondly, it grossly interferes in people's personal lives, as pointed out by Edit Bauer. Thirdly, it is anti-democratic because it instils fear among citizens. Fourthly, it contravenes two of the Council of Europe's documents, which Slovakia accepted in the accession agreement. Finally, Commissioner Orban has said that the EU supports bilingualism and multilingualism, while Slovakia has embarked on a path towards monolingualism and linguistic assimilation.
(HU) Thank you for the floor. I would like to draw your attention to a measure initiated by the European Union - in the right direction. We are talking about a minority - deaf people - whose mother tongue is sign language and has been recognised in 10 European Union Member States, finally including my own country, Hungary. This law states that not only is sign language our mother tongue, but that our cultural minority rights are protected by it. I also want to bring to your attention that Slovakia actually leads the way on this issue because the use of Slovak sign language was recognised back in 1995. So, what about Hungarians? It is my duty to highlight the fact that double standards cannot be applied in the European Union. If a Slovak deaf person can use sign language, let Slovak citizens use their own mother tongue.
Neither the language law nor any of the previous topics raised here by the Hungarian Members have any detrimental effect on members of ethnic minorities. Mr President, the rights of ethnic minorities in Slovakia and of all the other minorities are fully protected and are of an exceptionally high standard. We extend the hand of friendship to our friends from Hungary, we want to have good neighbourly relations and it troubles us greatly that the institution of the European Parliament is repeatedly being misused for manifestations of hatred against the Slovak Republic.
Unfortunately, it discriminates against local citizens in parts, since Czech is often better placed than Hungarian. Why does it not, at the very least, provide for equal treatment for Czech and Hungarian? This amendment of the law can only be explained by the peculiar composition of the current coalition government in Slovakia, where Comrade Fico is attempting to snatch away the votes of the nationalist SNS and the populist HZDS by invoking supposed Hungarian dangers. I am pleased to report that this type of behaviour was not possible during the coalition government led by Mikuláš Dzurinda. In those days, three member parties of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), including the minority party, worked well together and not against each other - and that, in actual fact, should be the aim.
The language law creates an imbalance. The problem with it is not only that it protects the Slovak language and not those minority languages which it otherwise should be protecting, as a huge number of positive examples in Europe can demonstrate. Rather, it is also not a coherent, uniform law protecting minorities, which we have said many times is what would be needed to prevent this balance from being upset. One excellent feature of today's debate, which was very important, was that we heard about many positive examples. I sincerely hope that this is the direction which Slovakia, too, will move in from this point on.
(HU) Békesség Istentől! Pace vouǎ! Boží pokoj s Vami! Peace to you from God! In our multilingual Europe I wanted to wish you peace in Hungarian, Romanian, Slovak and English. I was able to do this in the European Parliament, but under Slovak legislation, this would have been risky without violating the national language law. In one EU Member State, people can have a fine imposed on them for speaking languages other than the official language, which includes using one of Europe's official languages, Hungarian. This is a downright scandal and disgrace.
(SK) I originally wanted to respond to Mr Bokros but you did not give me the floor. I wanted to say that I accept that the Slovak Parliament does not translate all laws into minority languages, of which there are 11 by the way and not just one, and that as far as the size of the Hungarian minority is concerned, with its half a million members, we also have a Roma minority of half a million and they do not complain. I would like to ask whether the Hungarian Parliament translates all laws into minority languages and whether there are any translations into the Slovak language? However, I very much appreciate the fact that you took the opportunity to speak in Slovak.
I am happy to support Mr Swoboda's claim that we are moving in a peaceful, calm direction, looking for a way out. If only he had not said that this law did not violate fundamental rights. For instance, when a mother who is holding her 4-year-old child's hand at the hospital in a Slovak town is told off for comforting her child in Hungarian, who is frightened of the procedure the doctor is going to perform, we cannot say that this does not violate their rights. We cannot say either that this does not feature in the law. The problem lies exactly in the law's presentation. The law actually bans those exchanges in hospitals where the Hungarian language is under-represented.
I come from Košíce, which is a cosmopolitan city of 250 000 inhabitants, including substantial numbers of Hungarians, Czechs, Ruthenes, Ukrainians, Roma and, of course, Slovaks. Four years ago, voters decided that in the Košíce region, the coalition between us - the social democrats - and the representatives of the Hungarian minority was working very successfully. I would like to state as a regional representative that our cooperation is exemplary. Hungarians and Slovaks live in peace in our area and it does not occur to anyone to malign or attack one another on grounds of nationality. In people's everyday lives, there are no disputes and there is no nationality problem in mixed areas. I say this in all seriousness. If senior politicians in certain parties had not provoked this issue for their own reasons, the Hungarian ethnic minority issue would not have been raised in the European Parliament, because it does not exist.
I would like to begin by focusing on the essence of the multilingualism policy which we have wanted to promote during this period. On the one hand, we have wanted to be able to guarantee respect for and celebrate every language spoken in the European Union, whether we are talking about national, regional or minority languages, or languages spoken by citizens who have come from other continents. On the other hand, we have wanted to ensure that this celebration of diversity achieves the common aim which we all want, namely, to preserve and consolidate the unity of the European Union, in other words, our unity. We are talking about, if you like, the most direct application of the principle of 'unity in diversity'. In my speech, I cannot help either but take heed of the remarks made by Mr Swoboda to the effect that through what we are doing, we must look for those elements that unite us rather than divide us.
I have had the opportunity to visit all the Member States. I have also had the opportunity to travel in areas and regions where, regrettably, there are still discussions and disputes going on and, unfortunately, sometimes languages are held hostage to certain political interests which are not inspired by the EU's unity. I have also said loud and clear: we must find solutions enabling us to communicate and interact. This is the reason why, as I have already said, even in situations where things seem more difficult to accept, the fact of learning and speaking the languages of the communities which we live alongside offers us important solutions in terms of understanding one another. Therefore, in situations of this kind, and there have been countless cases, I believe that we can progress in terms of mutual understanding.
I want to make a few comments about the efforts we are making to be able to offer support to all languages spoken in the European Union. We fund a large number of projects linked not only to official languages but to numerous regional and minority languages as well. There are countless specific examples where the European Commission has supported, on the one hand, networks of organisations intended to promote regional and minority languages, as well as the less widely spoken languages in the European Union in general. However, we also fund projects linked to particular minority and regional languages. There are also specific examples of the way in which we support these languages. As I have said and wish to repeat, the strategy on multilingualism adopted in 2008 is aimed at all the languages spoken in the European Union. We have no barriers. We consider each of these languages as an asset to the European Union and as part, if you like, of the cultural heritage which we currently have in the European Union.
I would also like to say a few words about the amendments made to the legislation on the use of Slovak in Slovakia, of course. We are pleased that talks are going on at the moment between the Hungarian and Slovak prime ministers about the options enabling them to find common solutions based on mutual understanding. From a Community perspective, I want to stress that, given the extremely wide scope of application of this law, we are currently unable to evaluate all the possible implications of its enforcement. This is exactly why the implementation of this legislation is crucial, particularly the manner in which it is implemented. On this point, I want to emphasise that the European Commission will carry out a very thorough analysis where we will examine in detail the way in which the legislation is going to be implemented.
I would like to end by emphasising once again that we are endeavouring, within the constraints of the relatively limited powers that we have, to support all the languages used in the European Union, whether they be official, regional or minority, such as Welsh, where we have specific examples of the way in which we are supporting this language, or Catalan, where, for example, the European Commission has tried to open up to or draw the attention of people using this language. For instance, we have extremely detailed websites and information in Catalan about the Community's policies. The same applies to Basque and numerous other languages. I want to show that these efforts are enabling us to demonstrate the specific way in which we want to support this policy, which I consider as being an important European Union policy, one which is actually at the foundation of creating the European Union.
in writing. - I welcome the positive attitude of the European Commission and acknowledge that progress has been made with regard to the recognition of minority languages. However, much remains to be done if we are to place minority languages on an equal level with the prominent languages within the EU. Currently, Irish is only interpreted into English in the plenary session and I have had to stop mid one minute speech (while speaking in Irish) and revert to English due to a lack of translation facilities. Adequate training for Irish translators is currently only available in National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) and the professional bar organisations in Ireland, while this outlines progress I am calling on the Commission to provide further funding to establish other recognised Irish translation courses - so that an adequate number of Irish interpreters will be available in order to enable the European institutions to offer a complete Irish translation service as outlined in Rule 146 in the Parliament's Rules of Procedures. As you said 'we cannot consolidate our inter-cultural dialogue without multilingualism' and multilingualism cannot arise without adequate training facilities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Hungarian from Slovakia, I declare that the Slovak language law is bad. It is not bad because it violates Europe's system of values but because it violently interferes in the right of several hundred thousand free European citizens to use their mother tongue and restricts the free exercising of this right in an unacceptable manner. The fear of punishment and the language law's vague wording result in a situation where citizens do not even dare to use their mother tongue in places where it is permitted. On the other hand, the use of two languages is made compulsory even when it is entirely unjustified.
The Slovak Government, which is also adopting nationalist ideals, justified the language law by saying that it apparently had to create some balance in the regions of southern Slovakia between the use of Slovak and Hungarian. As has been said, this is intended to mean that Slovaks living in a district inhabited by Hungarians are entitled to receive any official information in this language. However, this only applies the other way round if the proportion of the minority is at least 20%. What a fine balance! To think that all this is going on in Europe in the 21st century.
Minorities add value to a nation as long as they can preserve their cultural values. This is why it is particularly important to preserve minorities' cultures. From this point of view, I believe that Romania, the Member State which I represent, has one of the most modern sets of laws protecting minorities. In Romania, minorities can address courts in their mother tongue. They have schools where instruction is given in their mother tongues. All 19 of Romania's minorities are represented in Parliament. In areas where minorities account for 20% of the population, the local authorities must also produce documents in the minorities' language. All decisions are issued in Romanian as well as in the language of the minorities in that region. I believe that Romanian legislation in this area can be held up as a model of good practice and as a benchmark whenever referring to minorities' rights and the use of their languages.
Agreement was also reached, following approval from the Commission President, on the appointment of Catherine Ashton as the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. In line with the treaty, Mrs Ashton will take up all of her roles on 1 December, including that of Vice-President of the Commission. Just as the European Parliament adopts a position on all Members, you will, of course, also be holding a hearing with Mrs Ashton. I understand that she will shortly be presenting herself to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and answering questions.
The work in preparation for the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has continued as detailed by the Presidency in its status report to the European Council in October. On 1 December, a number of decisions will be taken in order to put the Treaty of Lisbon fully in place, for example, with regard to revised rules of procedure for the Council and rules of procedure for the European Council. At the European Council meeting in December, we will present a new report summarising the status of the issues that we have dealt with in connection with the implementation and practical application of the Treaty of Lisbon. The European External Action Service will be included among these issues. The report will also contain a road map pointing the way forward for the work in this area.
My Swedish colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Beatrice Ask, and the Minister for Migration, Tobias Billström, were here yesterday and presented the Stockholm Programme in a very long debate. Therefore, I will not repeat what they said, but I would like to take the opportunity to emphasise that the Stockholm Programme focuses on specific measures that bring added value to the everyday lives of citizens. It includes cooperation outside the EU. A more secure and more open Europe requires genuine partnership with our partner countries.
With regard to climate change, while the European Council meeting is going on, the climate negotiations will, of course, also be taking place in Copenhagen. These issues are important for Europe and for the future of our entire planet. Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt stood in Parliament in Brussels and presented the outcome of the European Council meeting in October, including the most important elements of the EU's position ahead of the Copenhagen conference. It is now imperative that we continue to make it clear to our partners around the world how highly we regard this and that we provide momentum to drive the negotiations forward. The Swedish Presidency will put all of its energy into this work.
The designation of Herman Van Rompuy was, by consensus, a decision of the Heads of State or Government. It is a decision I welcome and personally support very much. Herman Van Rompuy has earned huge respect as Prime Minister of Belgium. He brings a combination of the instinctive Europeanism of Belgium - a founding member of our Union, a country that has always been at the forefront of this European project - and his own skills as consensus builder: exactly the two most precious qualities to have as President of the European Council.
I am extremely proud and happy that Catherine Ashton has been designated as the first Vice-President/High Representative. It is an appointment that I supported and approved during the European Council, as it is necessary according to the treaties. We all know her well as someone who has both the political skill and the sense of direction to take on the demanding task of the first High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission. I can assure you, from my own experience with her as a Member of the Commission, of her deep commitment to the European project.
What should the key messages from the European Council be? First, that we want to see an ambitious and meaningful agreement in Copenhagen that, first and foremost, enshrines the 2° C objective. This is essential. Sometimes we see politicians and diplomats negotiating. They can negotiate - we can negotiate - with each other, but we cannot negotiate with science. We cannot negotiate against the science of nature. We cannot negotiate against the scientific advice, and this is the minimum: to reach an agreement compatible with the 2° C objective. So we must set real and effective emission reduction targets for developed countries, as well as substantive actions from developing countries, especially the fast-growing, emerging economies. It must also be comprehensive, covering the full range of issues in the Bali road map.
The programme as it emerges from the European Council needs to lay out the guiding priorities for justice and home affairs in the years to come and to show how they will be put into practice. More effective respect for fundamental rights; better access to the courts; more determined action against organised crime, human trafficking and terrorism; effective management of migration - these are all areas where the Stockholm Programme should set out a series of concrete steps forward. They also require a strong approach with our third-country partners, which I am determined to pursue as we work together to maximise our global interests.
Today, in this Chamber, I would like to praise the initial statements of President Van Rompuy for whom, I quote, 'the image of the Council will be shaped by its results' and who advocates a step-by-step approach. It is through this method - what I would describe as the 'Jean Monnet' method, a way of acting effectively but without any political posturing - that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is finding its bearings. It is this method that has taken us from yesterday's conflicts to today's exchanges. It is this method that has taken us from long waits at the borders of the Schengen area, from fluctuating exchange rates to a stable euro. Indeed, thanks to this step-by-step integration of Europe, considerable progress has been made, and no one can deny that.
Like everyone, the members of the PPE Group also nurture dreams, but the difference between us and others is that we are striving to turn those dreams into a reality. We did it with the integration of Europe, we did it with reunification and we also did it with the Treaty of Lisbon which, despite its imperfections, will take us a little further in the right direction. It is this, and not merely sensational and short-lived statements, that Europeans expect, ladies and gentlemen.
Indeed, I expect the Council to evolve. I expect it to evolve into a more transparent institution and to work even more closely with Parliament and the Commission. I expect ministers to stop proclaiming national victory against their partners when they have only just got back from Brussels and to stop blaming Europe for everything that goes wrong. Finally, I expect the Council to stop changing its position depending on who its President is. I, along with the PPE Group, expect all this from the Council's first permanent presidency. Mrs Malmström, this does not apply to you since you have already been appointed commissioner by your country. You therefore no longer have any choice; you have to talk about Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both present and absent, in the last few days following the European Council meeting, we have talked a great deal about people and posts. Once again, I would like to direct my remarks today at you, Mr Barroso. It is important for us to discuss people and positions. As far as the posts are concerned, our group had one clear priority. We said that, as the second largest group in this House, we wanted the second position in the Commission, in other words, the High Representative who acts as Vice-President of the Commission, to come from our party. This is because we believe that the Commission, which is not a neutral organisation, but a political body, should reflect the reality of this Parliament. We have achieved what we have been fighting for. I know that you have also been fighting for this and that is why I would like to offer you my sincere thanks, despite the criticism that you usually receive in this House from me.
Of course, we are pleased that Cathy Ashton now holds the position of High Representative. Enough has been said about Mr Van Rompuy and I agree with the previous speakers. However, much more important than this is the question of which tasks these people will be responsible for carrying out. I do not believe that the citizens of Europe have any serious interest in the way in which Mr Van Rompuy and Baroness Ashton were elected. However, the question of how we can reduce unemployment, which is currently rising and not falling in Europe, is an important issue. People are interested in the question of whether we can really still prevent climate change and whether Copenhagen will be a failure or a success. Nevertheless, this is not enough. In my opinion, we are not talking enough about climate change. We are not having sufficient discussions about the fact that, for example, in overcoming climate change and investing in environmentally friendly technology in industry, there is huge potential for job creation, that green technology is a project for the future and that industrial policy and protecting the environment are not mutually exclusive, but can be combined with one another.
The ideas that you have presented here about the structure of the Commission are pointing in the right direction. This is an issue which needs to be resolved in Copenhagen in just the same way as the global health policy, the question of whether Europe should show solidarity with a dying continent like Africa, combating aids and opening up resources for the future. Can Europe's energy security problems be solved peacefully? Or are we threatened by intensifying conflicts on Europe's borders resulting from the purchase of gas, oil and other raw materials? This is a job for the High Representative of the European Union. The question of bringing the financial markets under control is a primary objective of European policy, because it is truly scandalous that, in the middle of the phase when the taxpayers of Europe continue to be responsible for the follow-up costs of the crisis, the casino has opened again and the gamblers have once more started travelling around the world. In this case, we do not need a debate about the allocation of posts, but clear rules for the financial markets in the European Union. That is much more important.
This is why I am saying that, yes, Herman Van Rompuy and Cathy Ashton have been elected, but now they need to get on with their jobs and the Commission has to be set up. Therefore, I would like finally to repeat my remarks to Mr Barroso. We social democrats have discussed our ideas with you. One of our requests has been fulfilled to our satisfaction, that is the position of the High Representative. We assume that the environmental, social and financial policy structure of your Commission will correspond with what the social democrats are asking from you, preferably under the leadership of social democratic commissioners, and then all will be well.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I shall not go back to the nominations of last week. Let me just say that there was good news and there was bad news. The bad news was that it was not a Liberal who was in the President's seat, but the good news was that it was a Belgian. As the President of the Commission said, Belgium is, in fact, a country with an overall consensus, certainly about European matters and about the future of Europe.
So, Mr Barroso, what we hope now is that we have a new Commission as soon as possible. I hope that there will be a large number of Liberal Commissioners in it -some people are saying there are too many, but for me 50% would be good! I think that nearly one third of Liberal Commissioners is a good figure. Anyway, I am very pleased that, of the eight Liberal Commissioners who have been presented as candidates for the Commission, there are four women, so there is a gender balance in the Liberal presence in the Commission.
The second point is the Stockholm Programme. For our group, the basic point here is the balance between security and freedom. It is obvious that we have to protect our citizens against terrorism and organised crime, but maybe, after 9/11, we have put too much focus on security and protection. I think that the Stockholm Programme - and also the philosophy of your Presidency - has to rebalance that towards respect for fundamental rights and also more openness in society. I think this is the big ambition and what the Stockholm Programme has to do. The view of our group, the ALDE Group, is that it is more ambitious than the Tampere Programme and the Hague Programme, but with a more important focus on the fundamental rights of the people. It is good to protect and to organise security, but you have to do it in a balanced way with respect for fundamental rights.
The third big task for the next days, as the President of the Commission said, is financial supervision. Mr Barroso, I think that it is perhaps becoming more and more clear that in the end, a single European financial supervisor is what we need. We need a good supervisory body for cross-border financial institutions that would link micro- and macro-supervision and perhaps link it as closely as possible to the European Central Bank - why not? - and, naturally, also to what is happening in the Commission.
What is important now is that the Council does not downsize the proposals that are on the table. That is my fear for the moment. In Parliament, we are pushing for more ambitious proposals, but I think the temptation for the moment in the Council is in the opposite direction. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that there is a good understanding about this between the Commission and Parliament, which will involve saying to the Council: that is codecision procedure, so if you come with proposals and the Council comes with proposals which go down towards the Commission proposals, that is not going to work in the Parliament. We are going in the opposite direction.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, you will understand that, as the leader of a group in this House, I am, of course, pleased that we women have succeeded in making the women at the top of the European Union more visible. However, it is important for us that women are not only taken into account in terms of numbers. You can rely on us to help you ensure that these women have influential positions within the Commission. We do not want mere token gestures.
There has been a lot of publicity about the people in the top jobs, Herman Van Rompuy und Baroness Ashton. The Members of this House are more familiar with Baroness Ashton than they are with Herman Van Rompuy. We will have the opportunity to get to know them even better in the hearings. I recommend that you suggest to Herman Van Rompuy that he comes to meet the groups in this House, so that we can find out more about him. Everyone is saying that the Belgians are very proud of him. Why does he not enter into a voluntary debate with the groups in this House, so that we can get to know one another better at the beginning of his period of office?
That was my look back at last week. The next summit will soon be upon us. Mr Schulz, I do not think that we are talking too little about Copenhagen. We are drawing too few logical conclusions from our discussions. Parliament will be voting this week on a resolution which includes everything that would be right for Copenhagen, if you believe the United Nations and the scientists. People in Europe have increasingly backed away from these recommendations over the course of time. My analysis of the central problem behind this is that climate protection is regarded as a burden and that the opportunities presented by a consistent climate policy are not recognised.
Another agenda item for the next summit is the Lisbon Strategy. One of the long-term tasks of this strategy has been to promote sustainable development, but we have not been able to achieve this. The different pillars of the Lisbon Strategy have always been given different levels of importance. The environment, social justice and sustainability have always been marginalised in favour of older and, in my opinion, outdated priorities relating to industrial, economic and even research policy. If you intend to decide at the next summit that we should adopt the revised Lisbon Strategy in the spring, we do not have time to analyse the weaknesses of the Lisbon Strategy, which, as I see it, has failed. Why did we get into such a disastrous economic crisis? Why do we have so many social and labour market problems in the European Union? We do not believe it is a good idea to prepare the Lisbon Strategy and to review it without careful reflection, without self-criticism and without a genuine consultation process, such as the one called for by the trade unions and the Social Platform, because the Lisbon Strategy is very important for all of us and for the perspective of the European Union.
Finally, I would like to look at the Stockholm Programme. Like many of these large programmes, it sounds like a good thing, and this is what is constantly being said about it and what people generally seem to be thinking. However, my group has the impression that there is an imbalance between freedom and security. We do not agree with this development and we will be highlighting this using the example of SWIFT. It was a serious mistake not to put SWIFT on the agenda. Mr Barroso, you are attempting to bypass Parliament with this provisional SWIFT agreement, while disregarding the concerns about data protection. This is an indication of the fact that freedom and security are currently out of balance.
But having spent a decade obsessed with its own institutions, the European Union now needs to get back to business. It is often said that the citizens of our Member States do not understand Europe, and, if they did, it would be more popular. But this misses a vital point. Our citizens do understand Europe's self-absorption only too well. What they do not understand is why so much time, effort and resources are devoted to the institutional processes and so little to the policy outcomes which actually might make a difference to their lives.
Mr President, I am very sorry that UK domestic politics seem to have taken over here this morning. What I would like to make very clear is I am not ashamed of anything at all that the leader of the Conservative Party is saying or doing and, in particular, it is clear to all of us that we have always indicated that, if the Lisbon Treaty had not been ratified, we would have wanted it to be put to the British people. I think that is an honourable position for us to take.
However, growing unemployment and poverty are the first signs of even greater inequality of opportunity which will have a major impact on educational opportunities. We also need to discuss this subject. The question that arises is whether the Heads of State or Government will find ways out of the crisis which combine the European concept of integration with social progress and which have a real impact for the citizens of Europe. Instead of exit strategies for the economic recovery programmes and mandatory budget consolidation, we need a change of policy. I have just three observations to make about this. Firstly, we expect the Council to give a statement on its position on the plans for the 2020 strategy, which is intended to replace the failed Lisbon Strategy. Innovation and knowledge, combating exclusion, green economic strategies, a digital Europe - as a list of slogans, this does not sound too bad. However, we urgently need concrete proposals describing how all of this will be implemented.
She has risen without trace. She is part of this post-democratic age. She married well: she married an adviser, friend and supporter of Tony Blair and got put in the House of Lords. When she was in the House of Lords, she was given one big job, and that job was to get the Lisbon Treaty through the House of Lords and to do so pretending that it was entirely different to the EU Constitution. So she is good at keeping a straight face, and she vigorously crushed any attempt in the House of Lords for the British people to have a referendum.
But just hear the next bit. There is something rather more serious than that. Cathy Ashton was an active member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In fact, she was the treasurer of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during a period of time when CND took very large donations and refused to reveal the source. What is known is that these donations were obtained by a man called Will Howard, who was a member of the Communist Party in Great Britain. Will Baroness Ashton deny that, while she was treasurer, she took funds from organisations that were opposed to Western-style capitalism and democracy? That question must be asked.
Well, we have our two pygmies. We will have the bland leading the bland, but I am not celebrating because they will press on with political union and, whilst our leaders may have saved face for the moment for themselves on the international stage, they have all betrayed their national democracies. The European state is here. We are about to get an avalanche of new laws because of this Lisbon Treaty and there is no question in my mind that there has to be a full, free, fair referendum in the United Kingdom to decide whether we stay part of this Union or not. I hope and pray that we vote to leave, but either way the people simply must be asked.
Mr President, with respect, I think the honourable Member has completely missed the point, because twice she said 'the people that were elected last week'. They have not been elected. That is the point that I am making, and, in the case of Baroness Ashton, she has never been elected to public office in her entire life. She takes an enormously powerful job, and the peoples of Europe, of Britain, of everywhere else, do not have the power to hold her to account and to remove her, and that, fundamentally, is what is wrong with this whole European Union. It is all about bureaucracy versus democracy. Things have gone horribly, horribly wrong.
(DE) Mr President, after all this excitement, perhaps we need a more down-to-earth approach. Energy-hungry emerging economies and wasteful industrial countries were not even prepared to implement the Kyoto Protocol. I am therefore doubtful as to whether anything will change following the Copenhagen conference. The purpose of certificate trading is also questionable, with millions being spent on this, while the genuine alternatives, such as renewable energy, are fobbed off with peanuts. This must definitely not lead to nuclear power plants being promoted as a Kyoto-friendly alternative.
The second urgent crisis, in other words, the subsidy race for the failing car manufacturer Opel, is an equally explosive issue. Signs such as a drop in orders were not taken seriously enough and the EU has probably contributed to the decline of a once flourishing industry with its raft of regulations. The lesson we must learn from this is that we need, in future, to establish basic conditions which can be planned and predicted for all industries, and until we have fully-developed concepts in place, it is irresponsible to throw billions of euros of European taxpayers' money at the problem. It is important to ensure at least that this money does not go to the US. In addition, repayment rules must be introduced.
If nothing else, it should be possible to lay the foundations for finalising the 'transparent' European citizen at the forthcoming meeting. The Stockholm Programme gives people fewer rights, not more, because they have no control over how the data is used. There is no sign of an end to the monitoring of passengers, the controversial subject of data protection has not yet been resolved and if we are to introduce a European asylum system, then in my opinion, we should apply the strictest criteria, such as those in use in Denmark.
Mr President, my thanks to the group leaders for their very inspiring contributions. The vast majority, although not all, seem, like the Swedish Presidency, to be pleased that we were able to successfully make the two appointments of Herman Van Rompuy and Catherine Ashton. Both of these people contribute to coherence, stability and increased coordination in the European Union, something that is necessary if we are to be able to focus on the major challenges that overlap the six-month presidencies. I think that is very good.
In the forthcoming period leading up to the European Summit, there are three main issues on which the Swedish Presidency hopes to make progress together with you and with the help of the Commission. The climate issue, with regard to which we are doing our utmost to get an ambitious political agreement with a timetable, so that it can eventually become legally binding. We will have to live with the outcome of Copenhagen and what happens afterwards for a long time and we need to gradually change our societies to become more climate smart.
With regard to Mr Verhofstadt's questions concerning supervision, I am pleased that we are nevertheless making progress on this issue. The problem that we have had up to now with financial supervision is that it has focused too much on individual companies and too little on the financial system as a whole. Cooperation between the different supervisory bodies has not been working either. With the new European supervisory bodies in place, we will be able to remedy this. They will have an overarching view and enhanced cooperation. They will also, of course, be accountable to the Council and to the European Parliament. Other details of this matter will be discussed at the Ecofin meeting on 2 December, when I hope that we will make further progress.
Finally, with regard to the Stockholm Programme: this is a very important decision that we will also have to live with for a long time to come and over which the European Parliament will have a very great deal of influence in future. As many of you said, it is a matter of finding solutions to the terrible problems that we are facing with regard to cross-border crime, trafficking and the threat of terrorism, and of balancing this with a policy that places citizens centre stage and ensures that an individual's privacy is respected.
So, this system has already saved many lives in Europe and elsewhere. We are talking about an extremely serious matter. I fully agree that the whole fight against terrorism has to be done in the full respect of fundamental rights and guarantees of our open, free societies. We were the first in the world to say to President Bush that he needed to close Guantánamo - we Europeans. And we stand by it. At the same time, we have to see to it that we stay united and committed to the fight against terrorism.
Finally, since so many of you spoke - and I thank you for your comments - on the issue of gender balance, which is so important for me, for the Commission and for the European institutions, let me signal the fact that today is the 10th anniversary of the international day for the elimination of violence against women. I think this is an agenda where we also have to do something in Europe. Unfortunately, there are still many cases in Europe where women are affected by attacks by their male companions or former companions. I want to use this opportunity to show our commitment to this very important agenda which is also in our European society.
I would like to buck the trend. Mr Verhofstadt never said a truer word when he stated that a glass may be seen as half full or half empty. I therefore wonder what the Council's rationale was when it chose these individuals. I believe it was a Community-based rationale, and I will try to explain what I mean by that. Choosing an outgoing member of the European Commission for the role of European Foreign Minister sends out a clear message: it is saying that the intention is to conduct a Community foreign policy and not a foreign policy that adheres to the philosophies of any one nation in particular. As far as I am concerned, therefore, the news is not that Mrs Ashton is British, but that she comes from the Commission. In other words, she adopts a Community approach to foreign policy matters that is not linked to the particular viewpoint of one nation.
(ES) Mr President, I took the floor yesterday in plenary to highlight the importance of the Stockholm Programme, which is on the agenda for the European Council on 10 December. I did so in order to draw attention to its content and, in particular, to call for the broadest possible parliamentary support to move forward the report drawn up by three committees working together. I refer to the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Yesterday, therefore, I focused on the importance of creating a Europe for the citizens, as well as a market.
Parliament will be strengthened notably in the area of freedom, security and justice and through the development of the action plan to be adopted during the Spanish Presidency. This is because, pursuant to Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 295 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, such cooperation is required. These articles call on us to engage in interinstitutional cooperation and require us to reach an agreement on interinstitutional cooperation in order to jointly develop a strategy for implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Furthermore, we are required to do so whilst complying with the principles of the greatest possible transparency, subsidiarity and cooperation with national parliaments. The latter will therefore be involved in the development of the Lisbon Agenda.
This means we will have to work much harder. Life is not going to be easier for us. On the contrary, it is going to become more complicated. We will also be forced to undertake an evaluation process to learn from the experience. The main aim of the exercise will be to ensure we comply with the European model and with fundamental rights. The European Parliament will also have to be more involved regarding data protection. I have in mind the follow up to the SWIFT Agreement referred to earlier today and which is so important in the context of our bilateral relationship with the United States.
In this context, I would like to talk briefly about two points which formed the subject of this debate. The first point is the Council President. Mr Barroso, you have just said that you want to work in tandem with Herman Van Rompuy. I think that this is a very good idea. It is right that you should work together with the Council. There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: the Council President is not responsible to the European Parliament nor to any other parliament. This means that you in your role of Commission President are the legitimate democratic institution and the legitimate democratic president of Europe. For this reason, by all means work in tandem, but please make sure that you are sitting in the front and steering the vehicle.
My second point is that the representative of the Council said that Cathy Ashton would take up both the office of High Representative and the office of Vice-President of the Commission on 1 December 2009. Firstly, it is only one office - High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission - and secondly, she cannot take up office without the consent of Parliament. From 1 December, the first Barroso Commission is in a legal no-man's-land between the end of the Treaty of Nice and the beginning of the Treaty of Lisbon. Cathy Ashton will only fully take up office after receiving the consent of Parliament at the end of January 2010.
Many constituents feel that Europe is as distant as it ever was and we have to address this urgently. Not all of us had a referendum and the opportunity to give our views on the future development of Europe, yet there are things happening across the EU that have a direct impact on our work in facing the challenges before us and all of those policy issues that have already been mentioned - employment, social rights, economic regulation, fighting terrorism, peace and justice - and I am proud to speak, incidentally, as chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Wales.
(EL) Mr President, the next Council will face a major issue, the issue of enlargement. When we talk of enlargement, we understand that Turkey is a large chapter in the debate. We, both Cyprus and my party - and I wish to say this very clearly before the European Parliament - are absolutely in favour of Turkey's accession to the European Union. However, we shall not tire ourselves repeating that this accession cannot happen if Turkey fails to deliver, like all the other countries which have acceded, on all the commitments it has made to Cyprus and to the European Union.
Talks are under way in Cyprus between the two leaders and, if a solution is achieved, it will be a symbol of victory for the entire European Union. This victory will encourage the European Union to take up its place in the modern world. However, we must put the truth back on the table and the truth is that Turkey is occupying half of Cyprus with 40 000 troops supposedly protecting 80 000 Turkish Cypriots. That equates to two Turkish soldiers outside every Turkish Cypriot house. I do not know of any MEPs with that much security. So we are talking about the isolation of Turkish Cypriots and we are publicly in favour of eliminating the isolation of Turkish Cypriots by the occupying army.
(HU) There have been two important personnel decisions made very recently in keeping with the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union now has a permanent president and a foreign high representative. Do these personnel decisions convey an important message to us? They do, indeed. We talk a great deal in this Chamber about the balance which exists between the European Commission, Council and Parliament. In my view, there is an imbalance, with the EU's government, the Commission, having a monopoly over initiating legislation. In some cases, it almost acts like a judge. It controls the main power, while we in this House give it the rubber stamp of democracy. The Treaty of Lisbon does not specify the duties of the permanent president. These will obviously depend on how charismatic and determined the person ending up in this post is. It can be interpreted from the decision that the power and control should remain - in your words - with the Commission representing the supranational common interest. However, what we say is that it has remained in the hands of the head of an empire centrally controlling the lives of 500 million people.
(EL) Mr President, it is important that the Treaty of Lisbon has finally entered into force. Of course, European citizens have been watching for ten years as the European Union has failed to find ways of ensuring the institutions work effectively following enlargement with the accession of the twelve new Member States. Today, however, things have changed. We have a Council President - and everyone assures us that this is a person who will seek consent and agreement - and we also have a High Representative for foreign policy.
Commenting ex ante on whether or not they are suitable in comparison with those whose names were being bandied about beforehand or compared with those who have supposedly specialised in such matters is unimportant. What is important is how the treaty will be applied. Cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament is hugely important here. Parliament's role has been strengthened but, in order for it to be strengthened in essence and for European citizens to perceive this, the European Commission urgently needs to raise questions, given that it has the initiative in the European Council.
Indeed, in my opinion, beyond the issue of names and functions, there is the central issue of the States. Let me explain what I mean. We are witnessing what could be the worst nightmare of those who conveyed the ideal of the European Community and their desire for union. At that time, it was believed that the roots of the Union were to be found in state legitimacy and that its future lay in transcending national selfishness. Tension between two contradictory mediums, which is sometimes painful, often produces original mechanisms, but, above all, serves a political approach that is unique in the world.
In making this speech, I do not intend, as you will have gathered, to return to making judgments on mere intent. I prefer to recall with you the rights and duties of we MEPs. Our duty is to question the impenetrable haggling that surrounds appointments to the posts that resulted from the Treaty of Lisbon. Our duty, in future, is to force the Council to put an end to this undemocratic, archaic method of appointment that fosters the idea that Europe, in building itself, is sheltered from the peoples.
Having said that, I shall now take up a number of points. Firstly, the issue of appointments. I am not calling into question the issue of people, but that of procedures. Furthermore, I really do hope that this is the last time that this will happen in such a way. Europeans expected transparency, democracy and clarity in the debate and, basically, what they got was obscurity and last-minute negotiations held behind the closed doors of a European Council. This must not be repeated, and I believe it will be up to our Parliament to propose new procedures and new rules for the future.
With regard to climate change, my wish is that the Union will speak with one voice and act jointly after Copenhagen, no matter what the scope of the outcome of the conference. Let us move forward! Let us aim for an actual 30% reduction in greenhouse gases! When I say 'actual', this means that it will eventually be necessary, one day, to raise the issue of derogations and emissions trading. Let us move forward and, again, make a firm financial commitment to developing countries. We owe it to them.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President. Last week, European society experienced two events. The society of football saw how a referee chose a team that will take part in the World Cup finals, but society as a whole failed to see or to understand how and why certain arbiters chose the champions for European office. Yet, if one asks whom the occupant of the White House or the Kremlin will call in future, the answer is they will call the same people they called before. As for the Council's December measures, given the economic, financial and employment situation, I challenge the Swedish Presidency not to forget the well-known situation of the Baltic States in these respects. Given the aggressive investment into these countries, they have been forced desperately to adhere to their national currencies' tight and investor-friendly peg to the euro. What this means in reality is the devaluation of their economies, so that the Baltic peoples are becoming the unemployment champions, while their demographic society bleeds to death. What sort of European solidarity can we tell our citizens about if their social and economic situation ends up even further behind the European average than it was before they joined the European Union?
(BG) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon should entail greater transparency, greater democracy and greater effectiveness for the decision-making process. However, as we are well aware, effectiveness and democracy do not always go in the same direction, especially when there is a lack of coordination between the institutions and relations with citizens. There is no doubt that it is more democratic to find an appropriate way for European citizens to be involved in the election of a president of the Council so that the European Union can really get closer to its citizens. I think that this will be a task for the future. In spite of all this, I wish those appointed as President of the Council and High Representative every success.
As far as the forthcoming Council meeting on 10 and 11 December is concerned, I greatly hope that an ambitious programme of institutional matters relating to the Treaty of Lisbon will be adopted at it. I am thinking of the European External Action Service. We must be given a clear understanding of its composition, legal status and powers. In this sense, our Parliament is voting on its position on Mr Brok's report. I am also expecting to receive a clear explanation from the Council on the results of the coordinated strategies applied and proposed for exiting the crisis, including any package of economic and financial measures. I would like to know in particular what the Council's view is of the future European Financial Supervisory Authorities, which should reduce in the future the risk of financial misdemeanours, which basically contributed to the current crisis.
Another important point which I am expecting to hear the Council's decision on is, for example, an integrated post-Lisbon strategy, which we heard is expected to be adopted in March 2010. I hope that Parliament will take an active role in this strategy. Europe's citizens must be at the heart of this strategy. Providing jobs through investment, research, innovation, green technologies and eco-efficiency must be a factor contributing to sustainable economic development, and not the other way round. With regard to the Stockholm Strategy, I would also like the Schengen Area to be expanded, of course, to include Bulgaria and Romania as soon as possible. Thank you and I wish you every success at the meeting.
(PL) Mr President, the forthcoming European Council Summit is still going to be dominated by the recent elections of the President of the Council and the head of EU diplomacy. For many, not only was the election of these particular people a surprise, but also the lack of a clear indication of their responsibilities. For a long time, we have been told that the new Lisbon Treaty will improve the work of the EU, but now, at the outset, it turns out to be evoking conflicts over personnel. Neither of the candidates has presented a programme, in contradistinction to Mr Barroso, for example, who did present a programme prior to his election.
The next task now will be to set up the European Union's foreign service. There is one consideration which I think is important to bear in mind when setting up this service - and I am asking the Swedish Presidency, and Cecilia Malmström specifically, to ensure that attention is paid to this in the foreign service - which is that there is an extremely low level of representation of new Member States in the Directorates-General for External Relations and Enlargement. When national quotas are being assigned to Member States, consideration must be given to the fact that the new Member States are essentially barely represented in these two Directorates-General. Therefore, no discrimination should be applied because for the foreign service to gain credibility in people's eyes, attention needs to be paid to this proportionality. It is very important for this proportionality and equal treatment to be implemented in the foreign service. This is in our common interest.
The spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, for which we have fought so hard, would not have been betrayed by entrusting the post of President to Jean-Claude Juncker, a staunch European, fine teacher and Europe-enthusiast with outstanding experience and expertise. It is rare to come across someone embodying so many qualities. It has not yet been explained to us in what way his unquestionable qualities constituted an obstacle to his appointment, as indeed seems to be the case. I am not the only one who would like to be enlightened on this matter.
The second reflection concerns Parliament's role. This is the last time that the Parliament will be meeting within this plenary with the powers it has had thus far. This parliament was born fifty years ago, and its members were appointed by national parliaments. Today, it is a Parliament that shares the power to decide, legislate and draw up laws together with the Council of Ministers. I believe that this will result in the creation of European Union laws that will better reflect our citizens' interests. This Parliament shall be committed to guarding the citizens' interests in the laws we adopt.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one clear priority for me, for all of us and for the entire European Union in future, and that is the labour market. We must pay much, much more attention to creating new jobs and securing existing ones. This highly important area can be the key to a successful and sustainable Europe and, in my opinion, has been seriously neglected in recent months. We must be aware that a low unemployment rate has a positive influence on many other areas. Let us make sure that we are applying the lever in the right place.
In addition, I fail to understand many of the speakers in this House who complain that some European politicians did not enjoy worldwide fame before their election. Why should they be famous? We need to be self-confident enough as Europeans to say who we like and who we think is appropriate and then to elect these people and not to decide on the basis of whether other people have or have not heard of them or whether or not they suit our partners throughout the world. Any other approach would be ridiculous, just as ridiculous as many of the speeches from many of the people who, if they are here at all, are hiding behind their brightly coloured flags.
However, it is not just God's gift. We need to make a determined effort to gain added value for our European project. First and foremost, the way is now open for common European policies. There are no longer any formal excuses to abstain from them. It is now up to the Council to start vigorous common foreign security and energy policies that could become truly credible for our partners. One of the most pressing tasks will be completion of the single energy market, developing all-European energy-supply networks and storage facilities, as well as implementing an energy solidarity clause.
Our expectations connected with the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon are, above all, a more efficient EU, able to carry out further enlargement and bringing benefits both to citizens and Member States. We expect the Treaty of Lisbon to bring a new start to the common market by eliminating the gulf between political and economic integration. We would also like appointment of the new European Commission to be done with respect for the European Parliament and its rights, as well as implementation of the new role for national parliaments while preserving the principle of subsidiarity, and discussion of how to build Europe after Lisbon. However, practical implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon means an acknowledgement that solidarity and energy policy are also matters governed by current legislation, such as the regulation on security of gas supply.
Perhaps the only thing that annoys me personally is that no Representatives from the new Member States got any of these posts, although perhaps this will be possible next time. In any case, I want to thank every candidate from my area, especially the Estonian President, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, and the Latvian President, Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. I think, though, that now we should go on with the essential work and stop occupying our time with personalities.
The second important point I wish to talk about is dealing with the financial crisis, which I believe the Council has made a priority. The citizens of Europe expect us to deal with the problems of unemployment and the financial supervision package. As far as this is concerned, it is very important what kind of Commission the new Commission will be, and how effective it will be. This is also true for my country, Estonia, because for us, the most obvious aim is to secure new economic growth in order to become an enfranchised member of the euro area, which we are very close to doing, as there is a large possibility that we will fulfil the Maastricht criteria. Thank you.
The new institutional arrangements have been adopted in order to bring our decision making closer to citizens and to make it simpler, more democratic, more transparent and more effective. In this respect, we have heard much talk of a powerful Europe. However, the essential question which needs to be asked here is what concept of power we should develop, or on what foundations we can build a powerful Europe. The European Union's power and success hitherto stem from two key ideas of Europe's founding fathers: the first being respect for human dignity and the second cooperation. This means that, whilst working to safeguard our interests, we should also consider others, whether that means individuals, peoples, minorities or countries.
Today, we need to ask ourselves once again in all seriousness what it means to respect human dignity and what it means to put the human person at the centre of our concerns. This question is very closely linked to the Stockholm Programme. Many of you here have called attention to the fundamental freedoms and the need to protect them, but we appear to have quite divergent opinions about where human rights actually begin. I hope that we can, at least, agree that human rights begin before a person is granted citizenship of a given country.
(SV) Mr President, we are hearing criticism that two quite unknown politicians have been appointed to top positions within the EU. I think that this criticism is unfair. We in Parliament at least have come to know Mrs Ashton as an excellent leader. However, the criticism needs to be dealt with, for many are now concluding that the Member States want to see the EU function merely as an intergovernmental coordinating body, rather than a separate political level with the task of finding common solutions to major challenges such as growth, jobs, peace and the environment. If it were true, it would be quite absurd.
Against this background, it is worrying that the Commission and the Council have found it so difficult to demonstrate any ability to act in respect of one of the greatest internal challenges that the EU is facing, namely the reform of the EU's long-term budget. We now need to provide the necessary resources in order to invest in the internal market. It is transport and infrastructure for energy that are at issue. We must provide the resources necessary to be able to back up what we are saying in the new Lisbon strategy with a view to 2020. We need to resolve the issue of climate financing at least to some extent through the EU's budget and we need to prepare for forthcoming enlargement.
In the case of Mr Van Rompuy, it has been said of him that he is a consensus builder and an effective negotiator, as if these were negative attributes. These are very important attributes in the times we live in. What do we want? A presidential-style guru strutting the world stage, causing trouble? A destroyer, a disrupter? No, what we need now is a good, effective, sensible chairman and I think we have got that. I wish him well.
I think some of the comments made today unfortunately by Mr Farage were over the top, but at this stage I am becoming aware of the fact that Mr Farage is like a long-playing record. He keeps repeating the same political agenda, harking back to the days of Rule, Britannia! and nation fighting nation. Those days are over. The European Union is the greatest peace process ever known. It shall continue to do so and we parliamentarians must work hard to ensure that that is the way it is going to be from now on.
(HU) Mr President, the Copenhagen conference features as the fourth item on the European Council's agenda. There are two important controversial points preventing the European Union from reaching a united stance on this. One concerns the sale of carbon dioxide quotas after 2012. The Commission and some of the old EU Member States want to ban the sale of quotas after 2012. However, nine countries - the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, the three Baltic States, Slovakia and Bulgaria - are insisting on being able to sell their quotas after 2012 as well.
The countries mentioned, including Hungary, have fulfilled, failed to fulfil and overfulfilled their Kyoto commitments. Hungary, for example, which committed to an 8% decrease, has achieved a 23% decrease. This is why Hungary finds the Commission's stance totally unacceptable and is insisting as firmly as possible on being able to sell its carbon dioxide quotas after 2012 as well. I would also like to call on my fellow Members from Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and the Baltic States, irrespective of party affiliation, to stick just as resolutely themselves to this viewpoint.
We are having the last meeting under the Treaty of Nice and we are talking about the first meeting under the Treaty of Lisbon. This quantum leap, this change, this new chapter must be noticeable at the first summit. Europe has changed. The debate about the institutions is over and the debate about staffing as well, I hope. We are moving over to policy making in a new context. Citizens' rights and parliaments will be strengthened, the European Union's and the institutions' ability to act will be reinforced and we, all three institutions, will be given rights which will make it easier for us to represent our continent in the world.
You can write anything you like on paper. However, whether we can convince the people that we have the political will to take action, formulate new objectives and involve citizens in projects will depend on all these meetings in the next few weeks. I am expecting this summit to generate a new dynamic, a new sense of responsibility and a more serious approach to handling different topics. What we have seen over the last few days was the search for the lowest common denominator: nationalisation and politicisation. The Treaty of Lisbon, on the other hand, is a call for Europeanisation and for policy making.
This is why I expect that we know what we will do with the model of the social market economy. How will we handle the financial and economic crisis? We cannot do this by defending existing rights, but by searching for global solutions. I also expect us to review our finances. It is essential for us to know how much money we have to spend on our policies. The summit must pass the responsibility for this financial review to the Commission. We must discuss the various themes seriously, honestly and openly and set ourselves new objectives. I wish you all the best.
Many people fear that the small EU Member States, for example, my home country of Austria, will have less influence, because the large Member States will be able to decide everything as a result of the new voting methods. People also have the feeling that the choice of the people to fill the top positions in the European Union was based on the weakest and lowest common denominator. That is not to say anything against the personal qualities of Mr Van Rompuy and Baroness Ashton. However, people realised that the process did not involve democratic choice.
(PL) Mr President, the most important work of the Swedish Presidency was, more than anything, the Lisbon Treaty, which opens up new possibilities for Europe. We need to establish a road map for its introduction. Filling vacancies is only the beginning. Secondly, we need to adopt a plan for economic renewal. We need to remember, not only about help for the banks, but also about help for ordinary people, especially in the area of limiting unemployment. Thirdly, we are working on a strategy for combating climate change - and this is good. We are deciding what should be done in this area, but let us remember that, in terms of financial aid, the fight with the crisis comes first. Fourthly, the Stockholm Programme means a safe and open Europe, a Europe of freedoms - only then is it a common Europe. A certain kind of balance between these important values is essential here. Finally, development of the Baltic Sea region requires greater cooperation of the Member States in the region, and Sweden has done a great deal in this area.
Naturally, we also support the negotiations between Turkey and Cyprus and the talks that are being held on the island to find a solution to its division. It is the parties concerned who are responsible for this process and the UN is providing assistance, but the EU, of course, supports this and I was in Cyprus very recently to talk with the various parties involved in this matter, as it would be fantastic if a solution could be arrived at soon. There will also be a debate on enlargement in respect of Turkey and other candidate countries this afternoon with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Carl Bildt, when Members will have the opportunity to ask questions about this and other issues.
I will say a brief word about the Baltic Sea Strategy. I would, once again, like to thank the European Parliament for the support it has shown to the Swedish Presidency with regard to this matter. It was, of course, here in Parliament that the idea of the Baltic Sea Strategy was born, so we are very pleased that it is now in place and in force. It will be a very important factor in being able to tackle the environmental problems in the region, but also in increasing cooperation for prosperity, innovation and security, among other things.
The European External Action Service is one of the biggest and most important changes resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. At the summit in October, the European Council approved a general framework for this Service. Mrs Ashton will now continue to work on this framework together with the European Parliament and will submit a final proposal by April next year at the latest. The External Action Service will, of course, be phased in gradually and it is important for this to be carried out in a competent and constructive manner. The European Parliament will have the opportunity to discuss the form that this will take.
Eight years after Laeken, we are now on the threshold of a new treaty. It is an historic moment, the start of a new era for the European Union. I am very pleased that the Swedish Presidency has been able to play a part in putting this in place. We can now put the institutional questions behind us to a certain extent and concentrate on the major political challenges that we know the citizens of Europe - because it is, of course, the citizens' Europe that we are all fighting for - are concerned about.
Finally, the Stockholm Programme will bring safety and security to Europe's citizens, and it is extremely important that we get this programme in place. All of these issues will remain after the summit and on all of these issues we will need very close cooperation with the European Parliament. Prime Minister Reinfeldt will be here for the December sitting and will then report the outcome of the summit and also provide a general summary of the Swedish Presidency. Thank you very much for a very good and constructive debate.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on this same day that we are celebrating the fact that the next Commission will apparently have at least nine women - and I also see that as a victory for all of us who have actively fought for this - we hear from news reports this morning that, in France alone, 156 women were killed last year by domestic violence. As this is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, this is something that should make us stop and think and, hopefully, also act in the future at European level, as well as at international level. Perhaps we should also bring this up in different meetings during the rest of today.
Let me also comment on the appointments of a new High Representative and a new Council President. Mrs Cathy Ashton was nominated to the Commission with the full confidence of the UK Government. She was actually voted for here in the Parliament a year ago with a very large majority - with 538 votes, if I am correct. As we have heard from several of you, she has been working very closely with Parliament and has always looked for Parliament's involvement on different issues. She was appointed unanimously by 27 Heads of State or Government, so I think she has all the legitimacy to fulfil her job and to gain the respect of the European Union's foreign partners. I liked the metaphor that was presented here that instead of having somebody who would stop the traffic, or mean red traffic lights, you would have a smooth operator, somebody that would actually help the traffic flow or decisions to be made in a democratic and good way in the European Union. I have got to know her as a very good colleague, and I would say that she is also a convinced European. That is indeed an important starting point.
We have already had good comments in the debate here. I think it has been a fruitful and constructive discussion, and thanks for all your contributions. May I also comment on the direct question by Göran Färm about the budget review. I can only repeat what the Commission President has already told you, that this will be handed over to the new Commission. This is firstly because the new Lisbon Treaty will contain provisions that require a new institutional set-up, so it will also have a good basis for decisions on the budget. Secondly, the new Commission will have to decide on the political priorities and then put its money where its mouth is in order to actually have the budget to accompany the political priorities. I would say that is an important innovation and an opportunity for the next Commission. It will also be handed over to Cecilia Malmström with warm hands from all of us. What the Commission can say is that a proposal for the budget review will come early next year and will be the immediate task for the next Commission.
The forthcoming European Council is intended to lay the foundations for the future of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. It is doing so at a time when unemployment in Europe is reaching historic levels and the economy is in recession, foundering in a deep crisis. Eight years on, we must bow to reality: the stated objectives have completely failed. The causes behind this failure lie in what soon showed itself to be the true agenda of this strategy: deregulation of labour relations and the associated devaluation of work, an attack on social rights, dismantling of essential public services, privatisation and liberalisation of key sectors of the economy and imposing the market as supreme in increasing areas of public life. Workers and people have every reason to hope for a radical move away from this agenda: a change of direction that it is vital to implement. Among other things, such a change calls for: recognition of education as a right, not as a service or just another market sector; democratisation of access to knowledge and culture; valuing of work and workers' rights; protection of productive sectors and of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; quality public services for all; and a fairer distribution of wealth.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the forthcoming European Council meeting, Member States are expected to agree on the main basic principles being represented at the Copenhagen climate conference. I think that it is important that the issue of energy efficiency does not get sidetracked by emission quotas and the financial support being granted to developing countries. In other words, the European Union tends to forget about this easy prize. The reason why this would be particularly detrimental is because in some regions of Europe, we can reduce emission levels more cheaply by improving energy efficiency than with any other solution. Two conclusions can be drawn from the above. Firstly, the European Union must endeavour to ensure a global convergence of energy efficiency standards with the adoption of the new climate protection scheme. Secondly, energy efficiency subsidies must be given a more significant role in the EU's future long-term budget, with particular consideration for the former socialist countries' building reconstruction programmes. This is due to the fact that in this area, it is possible to achieve spectacular savings with a relatively modest financial expenditure.
The key theme of the Stockholm Programme is 'Building a Citizens' Europe'. What this means to me is that, starting from now, European institutions alongside Member States must make progress towards abolishing the borders inside the EU, as citizens continue to face administrative and legal obstacles which seem to prevent them from exercising their right to live and work in the Member State of their choice. This is why the Stockholm Programme must make this key theme become a reality and come up with clearly defined instruments for facilitating access to the Community labour market for all workers in the EU, which is a major symbol of European citizenship.
The Treaty of Lisbon ensures not only that Parliament will be listened to with regard to international treaties, but also that it has to agree to them. This is the beginning of a new era for us and, therefore, we are asking, in accordance with Article 60, to be admitted to the EU coordination meetings and not to be left standing outside the door. The Commission must treat us in the same way as it does the Council when it provides information about treaty negotiations and we are asking it to begin with the Kyoto agreement. This is our request to the Commission. Perhaps Mrs Reding would like to say something on this subject.
We have before us an important event, because in a moment, Mrs Torstensson and I will sign some very important documents related to the 'Telecom' package. Mrs Torstensson, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, the legal acts which constitute the 'Telecom' package were enacted in a codecision procedure. Electronic communication and the internet have become the main tools of our modern societies. This legislative package is a good example of how our work can help people and how it can affect their everyday lives.
I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all of those involved for their incredibly solid and constructive work and very creative cooperation. I would like to extend a special thank you to the European Parliament's Vice-President, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, the Committee Chairman, Herbert Reul, and the three rapporteurs from Parliament, Catherine Trautmann, Pilar del Castillo Vera and Malcolm Harbour, who, like my colleagues in the Council, have done some extremely important work to enable us to put the telecoms package together.
I will not go into all of the background: the country has been in dire straits for more than 18 years, the humanitarian situation is horrible, and there is strife throughout the country. There is a process with the transitional federal government, but it is fragile - to put it in the mildest possible terms - and it requires sustained efforts by the international community to gradually move the country towards reconciliation and gradually build up some sort of functioning state that can restore some kind of stability to this horribly torn country.
On the specific problem of piracy, the Atalanta naval operation continues to operate successfully off the coast of Somalia. All shipments from the World Food Programme have been safely delivered to Somalia from Mombasa to Mogadishu and to Berbera. No successful attacks have occurred in the Gulf of Aden since early May 2009. This is, at least to a certain extent, the outcome of the commitment of the EU Member States and the rest of the international community, which has helped to produce a high-level generation of significant naval assets. The operation's success in this limited respect is also the result of close cooperation between the civilian maritime community and the EU operational headquarters at Northwood in the UK. This has allowed the development of best management practices which are also increasingly respected by seafarers. There has also been very effective implementation of the coordinated mechanism for the naval protection of commercial traffic in the Gulf of Aden.
In spite of what I have said, there is no room for complacency. Pirates continue to extend their activities further to the east into the Indian Ocean, and with the end of the monsoon season, we have recently witnessed a new surge of attacks to the north and north-east of the Seychelles, which is quite a distance away. No fewer than 11 ships are currently being held - all of them following attacks in what is referred to as the Somali Basin - with a total of 250 crew members.
I know that there is some interest in Parliament in the rather difficult question of the trial of suspected pirates who have been arrested and apprehended by Atalanta units. There are currently 75 suspects being held in Kenyan jails. The legal process involved amounts to nine different trials and creates a significant additional burden on the Kenyan judicial system. The proper conduct of these trials is, of course, essential if we are to maintain both the deterrent effect provided by Atalanta and the overall credibility of our counter-piracy efforts. A recent agreement with Seychelles, which I imagine you are aware of, on the transfer of suspected pirates constitutes an important additional contribution in this respect. Piracy is a very lucrative business, and it is important that in every single respect, we gear our different activities towards reducing every possibility of the pirates gaining further money from these truly despicable operations that they carry out.
At the end of the day, of course, what we are doing in the maritime waters cannot be a substitute for what needs to be done in Somalia or on Somalia itself, but that, as I indicated earlier, is something where immediate success cannot be taken for granted. We will have to continue the maritime operation and this will require firstly that we are prepared to sustain a long-term commitment of military assets; secondly, that we will have to strengthen coordination cooperation between all of the powers and international bodies involved in this operation; and thirdly, that we must also help to develop regional maritime capabilities as the burden cannot only be on us. The maritime international organisations, such as the contact group on piracy, will have an important role to play here.
Finally, this is one of the areas where we have demonstrated the capabilities of the ESDP in recent years. Go back a couple of years and few of even the most ambitious here would have envisaged us operating European Union naval assets in the Gulf of Aden or in the Indian Ocean. Imperative humanitarian and other reasons have led us to what has, within the limits of what is possible, so far proved to be a relatively successful operation, but let us not have any illusions. Much remains to be done. We need to sustain the operation, and the support of the Parliament is very important in this respect.
On the security side, a rapid approach is essential. The African Union has, as you know, a pivotal role to play, not least through AMISOM, which is the African Union force providing security for the transitional federal government in Mogadishu. Through the Africa Peace Facility, the European Union is a major contributor to AMISOM, providing funds to support African Union forces. The new contribution agreement of EUR 60 million has just been finalised. This is part of a pledge made by the Commission at the conference in Brussels in April this year. The joint strategy paper 2008-2013 defines Commission assistance to Somalia and, in concrete terms, the EC support programme for Somalia has a budget of, altogether, EUR 215.4 million from the European Development Fund (EDF) for the period 2008-2013.
The Operation ATALANTA, the EU's first naval operation, will soon celebrate its anniversary. This operation is a success, providing deterrence to piracy but also raising the awareness of the shipping community on best self-protection measures. But, we all know that much more has yet to be done. In parallel to the operation ATALANTA, the Commission uses the instrument of stability, a financial instrument, to support the Kenyan justice system - as the President of the Council has just mentioned - because Kenya has undertaken to prosecute transferred suspected pirates apprehended by the operation, and it is necessary that there should not be impunity. This support to the Kenyan judiciary system includes a sort of mixture of capacity-building measures for prosecution, police, judicial and prison services. The programme is implemented through the UNODC at a cost of EUR 1.75 million.
In a broader context, regional maritime capacity development is also an important aspect of ensuring security in the area. The Commission supports the implementation of the so-called Djibouti Code of Conduct of the International Maritime Organisation, once again by using our instrument for stability. A programme dealing with certain critical maritime routes, including the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden region, will assist the creation of a regional training centre for maritime affairs in Djibouti. This centre will focus on the capacity-building and training of maritime administration staff, officials and coastguards of the region, including from Somalia, Puntland and Somaliland, as feasible. A regional information-sharing centre in Sana'a, Yemen, has also been identified for funding in 2009. The first phase of this programme has already started and technical feasibility studies are launched.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through this debate and with the resolution that we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will approve tomorrow, it is our intention to express our strong support for the European Union's commitment to fight piracy. At the same time, we intend to express our concern regarding the dramatic nature of the situation within Somalia, which reinforces the need for and urgency of an action to promote stability in the country in order to tackle the root causes of the phenomenon of piracy.
Madam President, we must support the social and democratic development of Somalia in order to bring piracy to an end. In addition, we call for European vessels fishing in the southern Indian Ocean to be protected from pirate attacks under Operation Atalanta in the same way as merchant vessels are. We call for military escorts to be provided, because that is the most effective solution and also the cheapest and the one recommended by the International Maritime Organisation. In addition, we wish persons arrested and charged with piracy to be judged in the countries of the area, as provided for in the March 2008 treaty with Kenya and the Seychelles.
Madam President, we fully support the first part of the statement by Mrs FerreroWaldner. That is indeed the nature of the problem and its very root. Until we tackle the root of the problem, there can be no chance of either an air-based or land-based military solution to it. As to a maritime solution, the officer responsible for Operation Atalanta stated quite clearly yesterday that no maritime solution to piracy is possible. I would remind the House that the United States did attempt a land-based military solution and failed in the endeavour.
It would, therefore, be a mistake to hold back on development aid and on solutions concerning the governance of the country. No military solution is possible, but it is not possible either to privatise the functions of the armed forces, as the Spanish Government has seen fit to do. It is not a case of replacing armies with private security firms equipped with the weapons of war. No, that is certainly not the solution. The solution, in fact, is to put an end to all kinds of piracy. I mean, to put an end to piracy based in Somalia and also to foreign piracy that is wreaking havoc in Somali territorial waters.
Commissioner, what you said was a pleasant surprise to me. Until now, the only information we have had, both from international media and from all sides, was about progress in military operations. You disarmed me because I wanted to put the following question to you: what progress has been made to date by the political forces in the country, because we are now focusing on the fact that, in order to resolve the problem, we need political stability in Somalia. Thank you for the information you have given us and I must say that it would be useful if both the European Parliament and the media concerned with the question of political intervention could be given more detailed information.
What we are seeking to do is to say 'yes' to the strong stance taken by states that protect their vessels with their armed forces to deter and, if necessary, legally repel pirate action. We must say 'no' to recourse to private security contractors, a move which, according to the IMO, carries with it the risk of unnecessary violence. We must say 'no' to the passive and dilettante attitude of governments that are making life easy for the pirates. We must say 'yes', however, to diplomacy, 'yes' to aid to Somalia, and 'no' to unsubstantiated charges of alleged illegal fishing.
I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to express our appreciation for the excellent work which the Atalanta mission has carried out to date. Their efforts are very important, because the accessibility of this zone is crucial for international trade and goods transport. Our wish is that both the seamen on board merchant ships and the fishermen who work in the region will be able to carry out their jobs in safety. We think this is essential. Let us therefore continue to support the work of this mission. Of course, let us also consider what else we can do and, as the Commissioner rightly said, let us, at the same time, tackle this problem at the source, effectively and on various fronts.
What is the real goal of this mission? What is the overall political concept for Somalia? What value can we add to the current US and French training projects? We do not understand how this mission can contribute to state-building. What legitimacy does the transitional government have? Why are we supporting it? Why do we believe that the soldiers will help it? How can we prevent the soldiers from joining the war lords once they have been trained? We believe that there are still too many questions relating to this mission for it to be possible to start planning for it. Above all, I do not see what value the EU can add and I believe that the money would be better spent on other projects which the Commission is already running.
(ES) Madam President, if we are to try and understand what is happening in the waters of the Indian Ocean we must tackle the issue of piracy in a responsible manner, refraining from demagogic statements and from taking a party political stance. I am saying this despite the statements that I have had the misfortune of hearing in this House. Certain Members have taken the opportunity to attack the government of Spain while they had the floor. I would point out that the aforementioned government was instrumental in promoting and taking forward Operation Atalanta which we are today commending. That operation is clearly inadequate, however, and must be strengthened.
I therefore wish to ask the Council to strengthen this operation, to enlarge the protected areas for which it is responsible, to increase its staff allocation and to grant it additional competences. I refer, for instance, to surveillance of the ports from which the mother ships used by pirates leave. Nonetheless, it is clear that Atalanta cannot be the sole mechanism for resolving the Somali problem. That is why I am taking this opportunity of calling on all concerned to seek a common strategy on Somalia. Such a strategy should include development aid and political dialogue with the transitional federal government.
(EL) Madam President, it is a fact that Somali pirates are a threat to international shipping. Piracy not only affects the cost and reliability of maritime transport, it also - and most importantly - prevents the provision of international humanitarian aid to Somalia, thereby exacerbating the serious food shortage in the country. Nonetheless, I must point out that countries with a long tradition in merchant shipping, such as Greece and other Mediterranean countries, are particularly affected. I understand that the EU anti-piracy mission to protect the sea passage in the Horn of Africa is an important step. However, we need to understand that the very things that we all used to think belonged to the realm of fantasy and the film world - I read about them in story books when I was a child - are now knocking at our door, are a visible danger, a reality. That is why we need to coordinate, to persuade the Council and the Commission to take more political initiatives.
We condemn any act of piracy, without a doubt. Combating this phenomenon, however, requires more than soldiers and mercenaries. In fact, reducing it to such terms could even be counterproductive and lead to a worrying escalation in the conflict, especially given that we know that some ship owners, in order to maximise their presence in the area, are risking more than they should and moving further away from protected areas than they should, creating a risk that is always very difficult to address.
(PL) Madam President, I would very much like to express my thanks, and to start by saying that we have been given today, in my opinion, very good and dependable information both from Mr Bildt and the Commissioner. This information shows the fact that the European Union's efforts concentrate on two areas. The first area is humanitarian aid. The second is military action, and these two areas of activity are, fortunately, being increasingly effective. I would like, however, to ask this: should we not attach at least the same importance to building the State in Somalia, because it is, in fact, a country deprived of proper rule? Should we not also build the local police, as well as a core of military forces? In my opinion, if this third area is not treated in the same way as the other two, it will be difficult to achieve success in the long term.
That is what we are trying to do with different training programmes. Is there a guarantee of this being successful? No, there is not. But the only thing that we can be absolutely certain of is that, if we do not even try, we are absolutely certain not to succeed. If we try, at least there is the possibility of us making a positive impact. And, if we have received nothing else, we have managed to secure the programmes of the deliveries of the World Food Programme to the starving and suffering people of Somalia. That in itself is something to be proud of.
Then we have to help and protect the boats and all the people there. Then we also have to do what I said before - the colleague who spoke last has maybe heard me before. I said before that, institution-building, capacity-building, trying to help the legal process, to help the population, is absolutely fundamental. Only then, when we have more stability in the country and steps have been taken to eradicate poverty, can all of that then be done. So it is indeed a very complex process.
In order to be helpful, apart from the other things, we now have concrete support ongoing for 29 projects, worth over EUR 50 million, which is a huge amount of money for these people, that support governance, security and civil society, that support the reconciliation process and institution-building. The ultimate aim is to help create a functioning state that will be able to serve the Somalian people and where we also have to combat terrorism. Terrorism, unfortunately, is very much anchored there, where we nearly have a failed state, so we have a huge task indeed.
In fact, tuna boats are particularly vulnerable, insofar as, on the one hand, they have a very low freeboard and, on the other, they are immobile and not manoeuvrable during seine fishing: that is, during a four to five hour period. At these times, they are therefore at risk of pirate attack. It is this particular feature that justifies this specific request. I would also like to clarify that this classification in Operation Atalanta would be in addition to French and Spanish protection operations on board ships.
The Commission and the Council are right. The only possible answer to the situation in Somalia is a comprehensive approach to the conflict there, with coordinated action of all parties engaged in efforts at achieving stability in the region and ending piracy. Our immediate objective in the problem of eliminating piracy must, of course, be continuation of Operation Atalanta. This should even include extension of its mandate, so that fishermen would also be protected. I cannot understand why certain fellow Members do not want to protect fishermen. Since we are protecting commercial and tourist shipping, as well as ships carrying food aid, we should also do everything possible to enable fisherman to do their work in safety.
The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions by Alejandro Cercas, on behalf of the S&D Group, Marian Harkin, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Jean Lambert, on behalf of the VERTS/ALE Group, and Gabriele Zimmer and Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B7-0228/2009).
The ILO, with its tripartite method, is doing invaluable work in bringing coherence and rationality to our world. Our values are those on which the ILO was founded. It and we are working towards a social model that respects people's dignity, and we believe that we can work together. It is clear that Europe needs the ILO in order to maintain that social model - we could not do so in an unjust world - and that the ILO gives us the opportunity to be a global player in international relations.
The European Union and its Member States claim that they are working very closely with the ILO and that they are promoting the programme on decent work for all and the Global Jobs Pact, with the ILO at the helm. However, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, there is a lack of consistency between what we all say and what we do. It is therefore absolutely crucial this evening to discuss ratification of the ILO conventions, and tomorrow to approve a resolution on the issue, in order to offer certain guarantees to the ILO and also to our own project.
In your Communication on a Renewed Social Agenda, you called upon Member States once again, but the Member States did not respond. You called on them to ratify and implement the conventions, but with little success. It now seems that you must take much more ambitious action. There is no point in saying that Member States have already ratified the core ILO conventions. The ILO has updated 70 of its conventions, and even some third-world countries and developing economies are moving faster than the European Union. This is hard for the rest of the world to understand, and Europe is losing credibility and missing opportunities.
author. - Madam President, I am very happy to support the call for the ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions by the EU Member States. It is certainly worth saying that, when the ILO was created in 1919 after the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the First World War, it was to reflect the belief that universal and lasting peace can only be accomplished if it is based on social justice. In the intervening 80 years, the ILO has responded to the needs of people all around the globe for decent jobs, livelihoods and dignity.
Tonight we are asking all Members States of the EU to ratify and implement the updated ILO conventions; but it is not just the authors of this question who are asking - many other agencies and bodies are also. If you look at the United Nations Supplier Code of Conduct, you will see that the ILO conventions have served as a foundation on which most of the Code of Conduct is based, and it is the UN's expectation that any supplier providing goods and services to the UN will adhere to the principles of the Code of Conduct. Therefore these conventions need to be ratified and implemented across the globe so that all suppliers can adhere to them. Surely we can manage that in the EU.
The European Commission, in its communication on the renewed social agenda, states: 'The Commission calls upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO conventions that are up to date'. In a resolution on the renewed Social Agenda approved by the last European Parliament in May of this year, again we state that we consider that strengthening of the implementation and enforcement of existing labour law under national and community law and under ILO conventions must be a priority for EU institutions and Member States. So, tonight, we in Parliament are reinforcing all of those calls. We are asking the Presidency-in-Office to be as ambitious as possible on the matter, we are calling on Member States to consider the strong social arguments for ratifying and implementing these conventions, and we are asking the Commission to consider the adoption of a recommendation to the Member States to encourage the ratification of conventions that are up to date.
We also believe that the EU must ensure coherence between its internal and external policies. In this Parliament we hear again and again about exchanging best practice between Member States. Surely this is a prime example of where we can achieve best practice among ourselves by all Member States ratifying the relevant conventions and promote best practice externally or globally by, as the Commission itself suggests, setting an example by ratifying the up-to-date conventions. Today, 25 November, 7 650 ILO conventions have been ratified globally, with 47 in the last 12 months. We expect Europe to lead the way on climate change in Copenhagen; we could do similar good work with the ratification of all ILO conventions.
Secondly, as has been mentioned here today, a gap is opening up between what we say and what we do, in other words, a gap between the EU's internal and external responses. If the EU forgets or if EU Member States forget or choose not to ratify and implement updated conventions, that is not only bad for the workers of Europe. It is also a very bad signal to send to countries outside the EU that we are demanding should ratify the very same conventions. We should practise what we preach.
It is crucial that the EU takes the lead at a global level, that we show that we are a region that succeeds in combining good working conditions with a high level of competitiveness. The ILO is our global player when it comes to regulation at international level. It is essential that the EU supports the ILO as an institution and that we take the ILO's conventions seriously. Consequently, the Group of the Greens fully endorses the messages in this decision and we call upon the competent bodies of the EU to impress upon the Member States that they should take it just as seriously as we are doing here this evening.
The EU Member States have already ratified all ILO conventions covering core labour standards and a large number of other ILO conventions. The Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to the Decent Work Agenda as part of the renewed social agenda. In particular, the Commission called upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO conventions classified by the ILO as 'up to date'. In doing so, the Commission underlines both the internal and the external dimension of the Decent Work Agenda. In addition, where ILO conventions have involved exclusive Community competences, the Commission has issued timely proposals for Council Decisions authorising the Member States to ratify the relevant conventions combined with a call to ratify the standards as soon as possible, notably the Maritime Labour Convention and the Work in Fishing Convention.
We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) feel that the work standards devised by the International Labour Organisation help mitigate the harmful effects of competition on the international market, thereby increasing the chances of balanced economic growth being achieved. This has particular significance at a time when we are perhaps already emerging from the current crisis, and certainly reinforces the legitimacy of these standards and the fact that they have come about at the end of a tripartite process and were based on a separate democratic process conducted with the cooperation of governments, employers and trade unions. We are therefore dealing in this case with rights and commitments at the workplace and a comprehensive system encompassing them, which the countries who accept and ratify the conventions must comply with. At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the European Union, as a community, cannot ratify agreements. Only individual Member States can do this. This therefore raises the issue, at any rate, of the proper application of Community jurisdiction and subsidiarity. This is why the text features, very appropriately, a call to the EU to define exactly which legal areas and regulations relating to them come under the Community's jurisdiction and which come under individual Member States' jurisdiction. This means that if we can take into account the principle of subsidiarity, we will support the drafting of a recommendation, thereby facilitating the ratification of the convention as soon as possible.
Madam President, we have an internal market in the EU in which we are able to sell goods to each other in a free market. We ensure free competition and cheap goods, and that is all very well and good. However, other areas need to be included. Fundamental workers' rights must be ensured and respected throughout the EU. EU Member States must not compete on poor working conditions, and the workforce in all the Member States must secure equal pay for equal work. The right to strike is also a fundamental right.
It is therefore important that there is close cooperation between the EU and the International Labour Organisation, the ILO. We share some common values and we can use the ILO conventions as a basis for developing the European social model further. Unfortunately that is not possible at present, since the Commission only considers the conventions binding if they have been ratified by more than half the Member States. We could start by ensuring that every EU Member State as a minimum ratifies and implements the conventions that the ILO has classified as updated. We do not need more talk; what we need is action. How else can we ask other countries of the world to ratify and implement the ILO conventions and ask the WTO to include fundamental workers' rights in all trade agreements?
Unfortunately, within the European Union things do not go any further than these soapbox speeches. The Member States of the EU and the EU itself ignore the ILO conventions. They do not ratify them and they do not implement them. This allows the Member States and the EU to shirk their responsibilities. For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union has abolished the right to strike and the Commission has applauded the move. For example, the convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers has been ratified by only three out of the 27 Member States. This is scandalous and this situation needs to change 90 years after the founding of the ILO.
That is why it is extremely important that the conventions have been classified by the ILO as up to date after a tripartite process bringing together employers, workers and governments. That is the reason why we have put this recommendation to the Member States, encouraging them to ratify the conventions that have been classified by the ILO and asking them to contribute actively to their effective implementation for the sake of the development and progress of social Europe. We hope that this will happen as soon as possible. We will be vigilant regarding the deadlines for applying these conventions while, of course, respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
The rights established alongside the creation and operation of the Union also extend to the workplace. The importance which the Union ascribes to defending labour rights is not only demonstrated when it produces internal legislation, but it is also demonstrated in its foreign policy. We know full well that, when it comes to concluding agreements with third countries, one of the preconditions laid down is that basic labour rights be respected. That is why the Union could not but be one of the first to support the necessary systematic update of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions.
In France, we have an example where a ball bearing business has now closed so that it can be relocated to Bulgaria, and the workers of that business are being asked to go and train the Bulgarian employees. So you can see clearly that this downward pressure on labour costs leads to relocations, to downward pressure and to the decline of social rights everywhere. Consequently, we should invent a system of upwards harmonisation in terms of social rights and levels of social protection, so that there is no more of this fierce competition between employees, engineered by businesses and our institutions themselves.
There is also an external dimension to this. If the EU wants to be a serious partner in the international work to improve working and living conditions, it is imperative that the EU Member States also adopt the ILO convention. If we want to influence the situation in third countries, we must first set an example ourselves. I would therefore like to call on the Commission and the Swedish Presidency to act in a progressive way and to do their utmost to ensure that all of the ILO conventions that are up to date be adopted by all Member States.
Personally, I think it is a little disheartening that my own Member State, Sweden, has not ratified basic conventions such as Convention No 94 on public contracts. I would therefore like to call on the Presidency to take action at national level, too, to ensure that his happens. This, together with the Charter of Fundamental Rights becoming binding, should reduce the risk of the European Court of Justice making any more rulings like that in the Rüffert case. We cannot have a situation in which we have EU legislation that contravenes basic ILO conventions.
Madam President, the ILO, as colleagues have said, has been around for a long time - since 1919: 90 years of business and still working on the Decent Work Agenda. It is important that Member States, as others have said, ratify all of the conventions, especially at a time of economic crisis when workers are under pressure. But I think it is also important in this debate to acknowledge the role of the ILO in the developing world and its links with non-governmental organisations and the many programmes which it runs particularly targeting the most vulnerable, for example, working with people with a disability who would never have any opportunity if it were not for these programmes. Also, two very important areas that we talk about in this House: forced labour and child labour. So if we are looking to the ILO to do good work, as it does, in the developing world, I think the very least that Member States of the European Union could do is to fully ratify the conventions, to lead by example.
(PL) Mr President, over the many years of its activity, the International Labour Organisation has adopted and presented for ratification by EU Member States a series of international conventions and directives on matters of employment, trade union freedoms, social policy and social insurance, and also collective employment relations and conditions of work. Member States should ratify and apply conventions which the ILO considers to be currently in force. The European Union should resolutely and actively make its contribution to the extremely important matter of protection of the rights of working people in a globalised world.
Second, the promise to improve international coordination and the governance of food security through a reformed Committee on World Food Security, which would become a central component of the global partnership for agriculture, food security and nutrition. The European Commission has actively encouraged this reform and is assisting in providing core funding for it. This is, in my view, a very important step, which will pave the way for a global governance system of food security based on sound scientific advice but one also more open to key actors in the public and private sector and non-governmental organisations. These actors are crucial to making the new system more effective than the current one.
Some have criticised the final declaration for not setting more precise official development assistance targets for agriculture and food security, but we must recall that significant financial pledges had already been made at the G8 Summit in L'Aquila. The priority now is to honour them. With strong support from the European Parliament, the Commission has successfully mobilised the EUR 1 billion food facility, of which 85% is already committed for the period 2009-2011. However, we need more and sustained assistance over time. In order to be accountable for our pledges, we need a global pecking system of commitments, but we also have to develop monitoring mechanisms, specific indicators and benchmarks which can be used to report on the outcomes and impacts of investments. However - and let me say this loud and clear - even the most substantial commitment by donors will be worthless if governments in developing countries fail to translate their own commitments into better agricultural policies, strategies and investments.
In discussing food security, we should also be careful about terminology, and distinguish food security from food sovereignty and food self-sufficiency. Efforts to achieve production around the world are not enough in their own right. What counts is that people should have sustained access to food, which is basically a poverty question. Food trade - regional as well as global - plays an important part in enhancing access to food by providing farmers with an income and by allowing consumers access to cheaper food. Self-sufficiency in food or autarchy could be a very costly strategy and will not be necessary when markets and trade work well.
Therefore, concluding the Doha Round with a balanced and comprehensive outcome would be a major step ahead. We should also not forget that global food security is a very complex and multifaceted problem which requires a holistic approach. In this area, the European Union has made enormous progress in the past decade and progress will continue to be ensured through the Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) process. The various reforms of the EU common agricultural policy have strongly reduced export refunds and the vast majority of support for farmers in the EU is recognised as being 'non-trade distorting' by the WTO. Moreover, with the Everything But Arms arrangement, market access to the EU is free for the least developed countries, and the provisions of the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) show an understanding of problems faced by many of the ACP countries in guaranteeing food security to their citizens. We have therefore come a very long way in the EU, in enhancing policy coherence for development and thereby creating improved food security conditions for developing countries. Other countries and regions should do the same.
There is a wide range of different causes for this. There are countries such as Zimbabwe where an incompetent government has transformed the bread basket of Africa into a famine region. A communist president has brought this rich country to a position where people are suffering from hunger and we say nothing. However, we share the responsibility for this. We spend weeks, if not years, talking about the climate in one hundred years' time. The people who are suffering from hunger today and tomorrow are not interested in the climate in one hundred years. They want something to eat tomorrow, but we have no answers to their problems. Without wanting to neglect the issues of the future, it is a question of simple humanity to concern ourselves with people who are suffering from hunger today. Mr de Gucht, when we say that we intend to halve hunger by 2050, I find this almost insulting. As a world community, it must be possible for us to reduce the number of people who do not have enough to eat much more quickly. We can transport weapons to every corner of the world, but apparently we are not able to do this with food. This is a failure of the world community, which I would like to denounce. We must find other answers than the ones which we have come up with today.
The first point I would like to make is that I think the recent spike in world food prices serves as a wake-up call to all of us. The doubling of grain and rice prices has had a disproportionate impact on some of the poorest people in developing countries around the world. Indeed, it is estimated that an extra 75 million people around the world went hungry as a direct result of the higher food prices in 2007 and 2008. That is something we have to take very, very seriously. Indeed, in many countries, we have seen food riots and political instability as a result of the spike in food prices.
With world population predicted to rise to over nine billion and climate change predicted to have a major impact on our ability to feed ourselves, food security is, I would argue, a major issue that we must confront and address and find solutions to. The European Union must do all it can to help developing countries to develop sustainable farming and food production systems that enable them to feed themselves. That requires finance - as the Commissioner outlined in his statement - and it requires open markets. Here, there is a recognition that Europe has gone a long way to assist in opening up and liberalising markets. But also many of the problems that developing countries face result from a failure of politics and a failure of the legal system. No amount of help will actually correct that problem until you have got a stable political system and a stable legal system that allows farmers to flourish and to reap the benefits of higher market prices.
While the agricultural element of food security is undoubtedly key to solving this problem, we should also firmly focus on how good governance in developing countries is absolutely necessary if we are to have any chance of successfully tackling world hunger. Take Zimbabwe, for example, which Mr Deß has already referred to. It was once known as the bread basket of Africa, and was once able to feed itself and many neighbouring countries. Now it is unable to do so, after being destroyed by the actions of Robert Mugabe and his henchmen.
We need action, as you have said Commissioner, and we demand action. However, to ensure that action takes place, the European Union could enforce the principle of food sovereignty for all peoples, could help implement farm work remuneration systems with guaranteed prices for every country and every continent, could respect and enforce the commitments to grant official development assistance to the countries of the South, could cancel the debt of poor countries, could stop the purchase of land by multinationals and hedge funds, and could recognise that agriculture and food cannot be part of the hard bargaining of the World Trade Organisation.
In the ten years or so that I have been a member of the European Parliament, I have regularly heard fine words being used in this House. In the run-up to the World Food Summit in Rome, Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, also used fine words. He said: 'We have collectively failed in the fight against famine. That is a moral scandal and a huge stain on our collective conscience.' End of quote. And he was absolutely right. Which makes the outcome of the summit all the more disappointing. I have a sneaking feeling that what took centre stage in Rome was the political interests of the wealthy countries, rather than the interests of the one billion hungry people in the world. To give you a concrete illustration, I will use two examples: as is increasingly being recognised, the biofuel policy and its promotion are causing price increases and, thus, more famine. However, it seems to be taboo to express any criticism of this policy.
Apart from that, I have also spent some time going through the final declarations of previous world food summits and come to the conclusion that they share a surprising number of similarities - with each other and with the resolution of this Parliament, for that matter. They all talk of urgency and invariably call for the implementation of promises made in the past. However, should not the repetition of all those calls be a warning signal to us? To quote Mr De Schutte, the UN rapporteur, 'poor people do not need promises'. As has often been said before, food security ought to be a human right. Madam President, I wish to approach this from a different angle and say that the Bible teaches us that it is one of God's commandments that we should feed the hungry. That is my personal duty and our collective responsibility.
(BG) I personally attended the FAO meeting in Rome. I saw with my own eyes what this conference was like. I think that we also need to drop the hypocrisy slightly which has affected us because, given the money spent on organising a conference like this, where the outcome is usually only a long series of promises, perhaps we need to use this expenditure in practical terms to calculate, as the speakers before me have said, exactly how many children need not have died today of hunger if these funds had not been spent just on happy stories. However, the Commissioner said that the problem was to do with the global production of food, but before we start to remove the speck from our brother's eye, let us first see the beam in our own.
My country Bulgaria has, based on scientific proof, the most fertile soil in the European Union. One hundred and fifty years ago, Bulgarian farmers were able to feed the most densely populated regions of the Ottoman Empire in Asia Minor using 19th century technology. However, nowadays, agriculture in Bulgaria is in steady decline, even more so since Bulgaria joined the European Union. The quotas which the Commission itself has imposed on Bulgaria are restraining agricultural production, while the land in Bulgaria is going to waste. It only takes one farm in one of the 28 regions in Bulgaria to produce the whole quota of tomatoes, for instance, which is assigned to Bulgaria by the European Commission. It has been like this because some data 10 years ago indicated that this was the official production level. However, no one is looking at what the real production level could be. Currently, within the European Union itself, there are restrictions on food production processes which could otherwise significantly improve the situation and actually offer a real measure for fighting hunger. Therefore, as long as things are controlled by officials who only look at sheets of paper and are not interested in anything else, all that we will be left with are just promises and no action.
(PL) Madam President, the number of people suffering from hunger and living in extreme poverty has risen dramatically over the past year, and it is not true that this is the fault of capitalism. There are political systems which are significantly worse for human life and the fight against hunger. I will give but one example. In Europe, several decades ago, a country which has very good agricultural conditions was driven to starvation by communism. As a result of this, more people died in a single country than currently die of starvation worldwide. That country was Ukraine. I would advise caution about what is said in this Chamber.
In the year 2000, 198 Members of the United Nations adopted specific Millennium Development Goals. The Commissioner spoke today about the first, most important goal. Today, we must answer the question as to whether this goal is attainable. Europeans are asking if our priorities and policy are correct and, in particular, for example, if an expensive battle with climate change is more important than the fight against poverty. I received such a question only this week: is the European Union not mistaking means for objectives, and instead of fighting the effects of global warming, beginning the most expensive tilt at windmills in the history of humanity - a battle with climate change?
As Mr Bové said, all of that means there is a strong risk of stirring up new conflicts and, moreover, conflicts of an extremely serious nature. It is the lack of investment in agriculture that has led to this phenomenon of food insecurity. The fact is, agriculture is the sole means of existence for 70% of the world's poor, as Mr Diouf underlined. He made an appeal for a total of USD 44 billion per year to fund investments to help small producers. His demand has been completely disregarded: there is no timetable, no strategy and no political will on the part of rich countries.
Madam President, both the Untied Nations and the European Union have agreed that the growing world population is going to demand greater global output of agricultural productivity of the order of a 50-100% increase. We accept that. We accept the Commissioner's point of view, not only because we accept it, but because it is a target that the world cannot afford to miss. But, at the same time, agriculture is being asked to do it using less land, less water, less energy, less greenhouse gases. So there are three points which we need to understand.
Firstly, governments - and the EU in particular - must invest more in research and development; we simply do not have the information upon which to base a plan for the future. Secondly, faced with volatility in global markets, we need a safety net from the common agricultural policy. And, thirdly, food security, and all that it implies to the European Union, involves cost. These are costs which we cannot pass on to consumers, and therefore I repeat: we need a strong agricultural policy, and we have to win the argument in the budget debate.
It is a system that is based on real policies and guidelines and, now, Mr Michel, on protagonists and a liberal rhetoric that have led to the current situation: promotion of the agri-industrial model, in line with protection of the interests of the large agri-food industry, and the resulting qualitative impoverishment of the world's farming industry; years and years of inadequate investment in farming, of promotion of abandonment of the farming industry, and of liquidation of small and medium-sized farms, a sector that provides subsistence for 70% of the world's poor.
CAP reform will determine the farmers' ability to produce food. It will also influence the price of food. If farmers are not supported by Europe through direct payments, the price of food will have to increase to meet production costs. My aim is to promote food production within Northern Ireland and food security within Europe. This will only be achieved by allowing farmers to farm. CAP reform will play a huge part in this, and food security should be a central component of our work as this CAP reform goes ahead.
I was also the author of a report on global food security and the CAP in the previous mandate, so I have worked very hard on this issue. Can I make one very simple point, which seems to escape many: it is farmers who will feed the world if they are given the right climate - and I mean that in the broadest context - to do that particular job. The rest of us will talk about it. It is our responsibility to develop and put in place the policies to allow our farmers to produce food. They will respond if they have two basic elements: one is decent prices and the other is stable incomes. The recent volatility has hit both of those and farming cannot survive on that.
Lest I run out of time - and as one of the authors I beg your forbearance on this - please do not demonise the common agricultural policy. Some of the arguments made now are historic and out of date; we have reformed absolutely this policy and perhaps without the CAP, we might have greater problems of food insecurity within the European Union. Why do we not adopt the best parts of it and ask the developing world to take onboard a common agricultural policy? Because let us be very tough on this: we should not let the developing world's governments off the hook; it is their responsibility to use the development aid properly; it is our responsibility to ensure that more money is spent and invested in agriculture. I think it is time to stop pussyfooting around this issue and be tough with governments and tough with ourselves. We have a moral responsibility and we are prepared to take it on board.
Madam President, I would like to ask the previous speaker to be specific about what export refunds. I made this point in my speech, and I accept that in the past, damage was done through export refunds and that Europe has now reformed its agricultural policy. However, when we introduced export refunds for the dairy sector last year, the only country which complained was New Zealand, which is not a developing country. Can I please ask for an example of where this is currently a problem.
(HU) An ever-increasing number of scientists in the world are saying that a severe oil, water and food shortage will develop simultaneously by 2030. However, it would seem that the first one we must face is the food shortage, as there are already one billion people on Earth suffering from hunger. The number of people suffering from hunger is growing at a faster rate than the world's population. Therefore, while only one person in six is suffering from hunger at the moment, we must face a situation where in a few decades' time, as many as one person in four or five will be suffering from hunger. Two children die of hunger every minute. The solution to this situation is obviously not for us to discontinue the European Union's common agricultural policy. The European Union can only be strong and play a strong role in the world if it has a strong common agricultural policy.
However, hunger is not unique to Africa. Hunger is present in the European Union as well. For example, there are regions in the European Union where people spend less than 10% of their income on food, whereas there are other regions too - some parts of Bulgaria and southern regions in Romania - where people are spending on average more than 50% of their income on food. These also include those people - representing the average - who spend many times more than this on food. It is worthwhile emphasising this point because we must face the fact that each time we draft a new regulation that makes agricultural production more expensive and reduces its efficiency, such as animal welfare regulations which increase the amount of fodder required to produce 1 kg of meat, we are not only harming the environment by increased CO2 emissions, but every single measure of this sort increases the number of people suffering from hunger. It is perhaps precisely this extra amount of fodder which we must use, for instance, in rearing poultry, that will be missing from a starving child's table.
(RO) The number of undernourished people in the world has passed the one-billion mark, exacerbating the tragic situation that one person in six suffers from hunger. Unfortunately, as has been mentioned earlier, the leaders of the main industrialised powers have shown an indifferent attitude to a summit which is so important and necessary like the one organised by the FAO in Rome very recently. The leaders of the G8 Member States did not feel it necessary to attend this meeting, with the exception of the Italian Prime Minister.
We have reached the most serious level of global famine since 1970. A child dies of hunger every six seconds. Unfortunately, the world's developed countries are closing their eyes to a tragedy which will affect us all through its complex implications. The best example of this, and also a warning to us, is the neglect shown to agriculture over the last two decades, which has ended up at the current food crisis. Out of the total amount of official aid for development, the funds allocated to agriculture have fallen as a proportion from 17% in 1980 to 3.8% in 2006.
Madam President, in 18th century England, Thomas Malthus predicted that population increase would exceed food supply. Now, in many ways, his ideas have been discredited because we have had a series of agricultural revolutions which have transformed our society. But his words were also true: in the lifetimes of many of us, world population has trebled - trebled, quite incredible - and, in too many parts of the world, that has exceeded our food supply. We need to be doing more if we want to prevent hunger and control population growth, and the way of doing that is to ensure that women everywhere have control over their reproductivity. And we have got to save the lives of children. The best way of reducing population growth is to save the lives of youngsters, so that people do not feel the need to have bigger families.
(DE) Madam President, adequate food is a human right and hunger is a crime against humanity. I also think that the human race has enough technical and scientific knowledge to ensure that no one in the world should have to suffer from hunger. Of course, money is also needed to combat world hunger. However, it is not just about money. We also need to meet the following requirements beforehand. Firstly, developing a stable democratic structure in developing countries, secondly, fighting corruption, thirdly, establishing a suitable agricultural system in developing countries and then, finally, investing in agriculture. Too little is often said about the first three points. In addition, a lot of funding disappears in these countries, gets into the wrong hands and is used for corrupt practices.
This means that adequate long-term funding for the CAP is required. The CAP is an important element of the EU food and security policy and after 2013, it will play a significant role in development policy and in external food security policy. Therefore, perfectly functioning ecosystems, fertile soil, stable water resources and further diversification of the rural economy are the highest priorities. International cooperation and solidarity, together with balanced trade agreements which promote, rather than jeopardise, food security are an essential element of global food security and this is where a strong CAP can make an important contribution.
Secondly, because the motion for a resolution is dealing with this issue, and I am pleased that the Commissioner touched on this subject, I wish to draw attention to the danger posed by the objective of food self-sufficiency, which is very much in vogue. This objective, which is not synonymous with food security, might have an undesirable effect in the current conditions because climate change affects every region in a different way. This situation makes trade more necessary than ever and not the ambition of every country to produce everything that it wants to eat.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I also deplore that none of the G8 leaders were present at Rome except for Commission President Barroso, and of course, it adds to the image that this has been a summit which did not bring that much new. When you look at the final declaration this is, I think, also obvious. On the other hand, I think it is also very important that we managed to keep the food security item on the political agenda and the result of the several summits we have been witnessing in 2009 has certainly been that it is now high on the international agenda and that, whenever world leaders meet, for example, latterly in Pittsburgh for the G20, there is talk of development cooperation and development policy. So that in itself is a very positive element.
I have been in Rome and I must say that apart from the final declaration which is, I must agree, a little bit disappointing, there have been very good discussions and also a very good presence, and something can come out of it. For example, there was a whole discussion on the selling of fertile land in developing countries and countries which have no arable land; buying them itself is a very interesting topic to discuss and I think it is also one where we can come to some common understanding.
The second thing I would like to say is that, as a couple of Members have already said, the CAP is, of course, not ideal. Nothing is ideal in this world, but when you look at the effect of the common agricultural policy on the developing world, I think we can claim that it is, by far, the least harmful system of a big trading block with respect to distorting effects in the developing countries. The WTO has acknowledged that most, if not all, of our subsidies are non-trade-distorting because they are supporting agricultural income, not the prices of agricultural products.
I am also a little bit, how should I put it, disappointed that we are blaming ourselves all the time. Europe is not ideal either but I think that with the Food Facility, for example, we took a major step forward. This involves EUR 1 billion on a two-year basis; it is not about supporting the delivery of food, but is largely focused on delivering seeds and so on, sustaining small agricultural producers in the developing world. I think this really is an innovation. It has also been acknowledged as such by the World Bank, for example, which is taking over this mechanism. So we should not blame ourselves all the time. By the way, this facility was an innovation by my predecessor. There is one thing I do not agree with him and that was about a gentleman who, in the meantime, has disappeared, Mr Le Hyaric. He is not a socialist, my predecessor, he is a communist; I mean you should look at his political group: he is a communist and that probably explains the reasoning he was using.
I will end by saying a last word on the new EU agricultural and food security policy because, in the 2010 work programme of the Commission, there is a plan to present to the Council and the Parliament a communication on a renewed policy for agriculture and food security for the European Union. This document will review current issues affecting agriculture and food security, for example, challenges posed by climate change, enhanced attention to nutrition and food quality, safety nets and social protection policies, the impact of biofuels on food production or the use and impact of new technologies and biotechnologies, increased calls for rights-based approaches, large-scale land acquisition, etc.
The communication will aim firstly at renewing the EU commitment to assist developing countries advancing their agricultural production. This remains crucial, notably in view of the increasing demand for food due to a growing global population and changing dietary patterns and the challenges and threats that climate change is posing to sustainable agricultural production. Secondly, it will aim at launching reflection on how the EU could best use its experience and know-how to support the emergence of regional policies and strategic frameworks in agriculture and food security. Thirdly, it will aim at providing the basis for the whole EU approach to harmonise existing ECMS policy frameworks following the commitments set out in the L'Aquila agenda for action. Fourthly, it will aim at proposing ways on how the EU could contribute to accelerating the process towards the achievements of the MDGs and notably, MDG1 in view of the upcoming review of the MDGs in September 2010 in New York. Fifthly, it will aim at better positioning the EU vis-à-vis current developments in the global food agricultural governance system, and lastly, at addressing issues that have recently gained prominence in the food security agenda.
(RO) I wanted to highlight above all the quality of the efforts made by Gabriele Albertini in drafting the motion. I also wanted to say that I voted in favour of this motion, given that enlargement is an important political gesture for the EU. I also want to point out that I have voted differently from my political group on several issues, basically linked to Kosovo, as I hold a different view to the majority of European countries about Kosovo. Therefore, I voted differently on Amendment 17 in Article 19, Amendment 22, Amendment 24 and also after citation 4 in point 10.
(BG) I voted against the enlargement strategy resolution because it contains many flattering words about the progress Turkey is making under the Copenhagen criteria. I do not see any sign of this progress. Fellow Members, please understand once and for all that Turkey is a country which, less than 100 years ago, committed genocide against the peoples within its borders and peoples which had recently liberated themselves from Turkish rule. Today, Turkey still continues to commit genocide, and its population and political class are proud of these actions committed by their country. Twenty years ago, Turkey sponsored terrorist organisations and exported terrorism. It continues to foster close links with terrorist organisations even to this day. If we want to have a country in the European Union which is still proud of genocide and sponsors terrorism, then go ahead and accept it. However, I am definitely against this.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also voted no, because I am of the opinion that Turkey must first fulfil all the criteria, before we can make such a positive statement here. In particular, I would like to highlight the border dispute between Cyprus and Turkey, which has still not been settled this year, and the illegal occupation of Cyprus, which has not yet been brought to an end. However, I did not want to vote against the other accession candidates. I would particularly make an exception in the case of the Balkan States which I would like to welcome here in this House as soon as possible.
It would be difficult to say something more absurd. In Poland, there are no honour killings, circumcision of girls is not a general practice, there is no selective abortion, there are no temporary marriages, and people are not stoned for actual or claimed adultery. Women do not suffer discrimination by the law in any way, and all instances of violence against women are universally condemned, both by the citizens and by the Catholic Church. Fortunately, extreme statements of this kind did not find their way into the resolution, so I only abstained.
(SV) Mr President, violence against women is a widespread problem throughout Europe and, indeed, the world. In Sweden alone, with a population of nine million, 380 women are abused every day. A fifth of the female population is subjected to violence and 45% of all women between the ages of 16 and 64 have, at some time in their lives, been victims of acts of violence. This is absolutely appalling. Being subjected to violence in the home is a horrendous violation of personal integrity. Men and women should have the same chance of physical integrity.
I am particularly sensitive to the women in conflict as I shared, provided help during, and lived through, all the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and partly also with the Red Cross in Darfur. I think that we now have a fantastic instrument with the Stockholm Programme to enable us to move from words to action. I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for having included empowerment and combating violence against women in the Stockholm Programme. I will definitely work towards there being a priority, in the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, for combating violence against women.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to stress that the subject of violence against women is extremely important, and I am very glad that the European Parliament has taken up this problem. Worthy of particular attention is the problem of the most aggressive and brutal sexually motivated crimes, which are committed against women but which do not always meet with an adequate reaction from the justice system in some European countries. Sentences handed down by courts in such cases are often extremely lenient, which in some cases causes women to lose motivation to report the drastic incidents which have happened to them to the law enforcement authorities. This leads to the existence of invisible crime statistics. This is why, in cases of these most drastic and serious crimes against women, where violence is used and which are sexually motivated, we should give greater attention to efforts at standardising sentencing, to give a sense of security and also a certain feeling of justice and moral satisfaction to women who have been affected in such a cruel way.
I do not believe - in common with the majority of my fellow Members in the European Parliament, which is very pleasing - that we in Brussels must impose regulations for the protection of non-smokers or that we are able to do this more effectively. The European Union has no authority in this area. We are only responsible for health and safety at work. This is where the problem lies, because for me the most important issue is protecting children and young people and this group, which specifically needs protection, would not be covered by regulations that refer only to health and safety at work.
However, we are in a slightly different position here in the European Parliament, where we have to consider the principle of subsidiarity. While indeed there may be an issue with regard to the protection of workers' health - we have legislation in this area already, such as on exposure to electro-magnetic radiation - we cannot ask, as we did in paragraph 7, that Member States, where smoking bans already exist, respect the principle of equality between different types of establishment in the hospitality sector. Yesterday, we voted on the role of national parliaments and their powers on proposed EU legislation in the area of subsidiarity under the new Lisbon Treaty, so we have to be very careful that we are coherent in the way we vote.
(PL) Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak. I support the action being taken by the European Union to reduce tobacco consumption, but I do not think this action should be based on reducing support for tobacco producers. This is because tobacco production is not related to its consumption. If we reduce or eliminate production, or if we withdraw support from farms which produce tobacco, there will still be consumption, only it will be consumption of imported tobacco. Fighting the tobacco producers is not the way to reduce smoking. That would be rather like trying to reduce beer consumption among young people by starting with a fight against hops producers. This is why I endorsed with my vote the position which says that production of tobacco does not influence its consumption.
I was delighted to support the approved resolution, even though I have reservations over the solution to the question of world hunger. The meeting of the World Summit on Food Security did not take the direction desired by the organisers. Even though the fight against hunger is a problem with socio-economic, financial and cultural dimensions, the discussions in the meeting were restricted just to the technical level. Even FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf was disappointed with the meeting and with the fact that representatives of western countries did not participate in the meeting. The representatives of the developed world did not adopt any concrete obligations.
I voted in favour of Mr Scurria's report on the European Year of Volunteering (2011), advocating greater support from the institutions of the EU for this sector, which involves millions of European citizens and is essential for the promotion of solidarity and social inclusion. I believe that both the budget and coordination need to be increased at Community level, so as to consolidate the initiatives that form part of the European Year of Volunteering, such as awareness campaigns and transnational exchanges focusing on ideas and good practice.
in writing. - It is with great pleasure that I have voted in favour of naming 2011 as the European Year of Volunteering. It is a great boon to the numerous voluntary organisations in all of our Member States of the EU. I would like to point out that sporting organisations play a central role in volunteering and, despite this not being stipulated explicitly in the legislative text, nevertheless needs to be acknowledged. Indeed, the largest voluntary association in Ireland is the Gaelic Athletic Association. The efforts of all involved in this great institution need to be duly recognised and lauded.
I voted in favour of the draft report on the European Year of Volunteering for a number of reasons. It is well known that voluntary activities offer a two-fold benefit: for the individual and for society. On the one hand, volunteering offers citizens the chance to learn and acquire new skills and for self-development. On the other hand, it also has a social function, contributing to the creation of a sense of solidarity and belonging. Bearing in mind the ever-growing interdependence of local communities in a globalised world and, at the same time, the worsening extent of individualistic behaviour, it is becoming vital to encourage social participation by citizens. I am referring in this instance to activities involving both young and old alike. Furthermore, I think that the exchange of experiences first-hand between volunteer organisations from the most diverse corners of the European Union has a major impact, given that the values motivating them all are the same. The purpose is identical: to raise the standard of living and improve the quality of life, ensure a high level of employment, improve social cohesion and combat exclusion. In other words, these are precisely the values on which the European Union is founded.
in writing. - Despite the request for a budget increase which I opposed and voted against at the committee stages, I nonetheless fully support the Report on the European Year of Volunteering overall. Volunteers are often unsung heroes. They make an immeasurable impact in their communities and on people's lives. In tough economic times like these, volunteering becomes all the more important and that is why I and others who brought this report forward are keen not only to raise awareness of the benefits of volunteering, but also to create a European Year where properly-funded initiatives will provide volunteering organisations the opportunity to encourage new volunteers to come forward.
I endorsed the report on the European Year of Volunteering (2011). In the Member States of the European Union, we must give more importance to the question of volunteering, and should plan political action which supports the work of volunteers. The amendments proposed by the European Parliament introduce many significant changes to the Commission's proposal, and these should be included by the Council. The budgetary amount earmarked for achievement of the objectives of the European Year of Volunteering (2011), which amounts to EUR 6 million, is insufficient (by way of comparison, the budget for the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion is nearly three times higher).
Volunteering is a gratuitous and unpaid activity, but this does not mean that it does not generate any costs. Volunteering needs financial and political support from all interested parties: non-government organisations, governments, administrative bodies of both national and local government, and businesses. Political commitment should be seen in the form of favourable policy which supports the development and infrastructure of volunteering. This matter is especially important for Poland, which will hold the EU Presidency in 2011. I would like to ask the Government of Poland to follow the example set by the European Parliament and take action to increase financial support for the European Year of Volunteering. I fully support the proposal to designate financial means for the creation of an interactive database for volunteers and voluntary organisations, which would be accessible to all stakeholders and which would continue to operate after 2011.
Volunteering also has economic value, and we must not forget this. It is, indeed, an unpaid and gratuitous activity, but this does not mean, however, that it does not involve any financial outlay. For this reason, it is important that volunteering receive support from the European Community. Volunteering requires policy based on friendly relations, which will support its development and infrastructure. I think that supporting the reward and recognition of voluntary activities by using certain financial means will motivate individuals, businesses and organisations.
I would like to explain my vote on the report of Marco Scurria on the proposal for a Council Decision on the European Year of Volunteering. Personally, I consider unpaid voluntary activities to be an important part of our society. In my own country, the Czech Republic, the most numerous and long-established voluntary organisations are the voluntary fire fighters. Their traditions go back a long way to a period when the need to avert catastrophic elemental disasters such as fires always brought together a few dozen volunteers whose aim was to protect their own property and that of their neighbours and other people they lived with. The most widely-spread and oldest organisations involved in voluntary work also include the Czech Red Cross, the Czech Tourists' Club, the Sokol gymnastic association, the Junák youth organisation and the voluntary mountain rescue service. All of these people who help in schools, hospitals and sports clubs or in the mountains, or who travel abroad to provide aid, deserve recognition. In this regard, it will surely be wholly beneficial to dedicate the year 2011 to this theme. For this reason I voted in favour of the report.
However, I would like to raise a specific reservation over the method of assessing the agreement. If the authors introduce efficiency indicators such as 'number of work trips and meetings', and even 'number of different areas of cooperative endeavour' then I have serious doubts as to the familiarity of the report's author with the issue in question. Section 7, 'Measures Against Fraud', makes a quite desperate impression, while statement 8.2.2 makes me question my sanity. In the age of electronic communications, I cannot understand why a 'report' on an agreement requires work trips and participation in meetings on the part of specialists and officials from the EU and Ukraine. In conclusion, I am happy to support this framework agreement because I know that in the Sixth Framework Programme, developments in science and research were already being integrated very actively and with genuinely good results. The aforementioned reservations notwithstanding, the GUE/NGL group supports the decision of the Council.
As we face a flood of applications for EU membership, the vote on this resolution could not have come at a better time. The EU is a rock of stability on this continent. It cannot remain a club which is closed to other European states, but it cannot open its doors indefinitely either. The European Union must, above all, make a success of the enlargements it has already carried out for the new Member States. As for the other states knocking on its door, the prerequisite for initiating any accession negotiations remains strict compliance with the Copenhagen criteria (democracy, rule of law, human rights, gender equality, market economy, etc.), along with unconditional observance of international law. Accession negotiations with candidate countries must be based on objectively measurable criteria, such as respect for rights and economic criteria, and avoid any kind of subjective reference based on values, religion or culture. In my view, what we therefore need to do is as follows: confirm the Balkans' suitability for EU membership; remember that enlargement and consolidation are inextricably linked; insist, in the case of Turkey, on compliance with the accession criteria; and, in the event of the negotiations' failure, propose a special association agreement.
in writing. - I voted for Amendment 4. I very much believe that we have to underline that by non-muslims, we first and foremost mean the Christians, therefore a mention of Christians explicitly next to other religious communities is needed. Christians are still persecuted in Turkey and it remains one of our biggest concerns. Christians and their communities are still not able to exercise their belief freely as they should be in a democratic state. I am convinced that Turkey will be ready for EU accession at the moment when it becomes as easy to raise a Christian church in Turkey as it is to raise a mosque in Brussels.
I understand that the accession of Turkey is seen as grounds for a preliminary debate, yet this indicates that there are doubts which, at the very least, justify this debate. The debate would include issues such as whether Turkey can, geographically speaking, be considered part of Europe, whether its secularity is merely the result of the army which keeps it in check, whether an EU with borders stretching to Iraqi Kurdistan would be wise, and whether, due to its enormous demographic mass, Turkey's accession would throw the EU off balance.
With regard to the resolution on the Commission's enlargement strategy paper for 2009, we would like to make it clear, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of Kosovo as an independent State. We feel that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States.
I strongly oppose the Commission's enlargement strategy with regard to Turkey. The clear majority of EU citizens is against Turkey joining the EU and yet they must help to fund payments of billions of euros to Turkey in its role of official accession candidate. Turkey is not a European country, either geographically or culturally, or in terms of safeguarding human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The enlargement strategy takes almost no account of the concerns of the citizens of Europe. Instead it represents the geostrategic interests of the US. In addition, the unresolved conflicts on Turkey's borders will become EU problems if Turkey were to join. I regret the fact that the entire enlargement strategy, which includes Iceland and the western Balkans as well as Turkey, was discussed as a whole and this made it impossible to have a proper, selective, differentiated debate. The arrogance with which the subject of Turkey's accession is being handled is reflected in this procedure. The unwelcome voices of those opposed to accession, who represent the majority of the population, are largely being ignored.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Commission's 2009 enlargement strategy paper concerning the Western Balkan countries, Iceland and Turkey, since 6-15 years ago, Lithuania, together with the Baltic States and other Central and Eastern European countries, was in a similar situation to the candidate countries. Membership of the European Union gave my country and the other new EU Member States and their citizens many new opportunities, and helped to boost the economy and to strengthen democracy and human rights. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will have a new, more powerful engine that will drive our ship forward more successfully and through the waters of the financial and economic crisis, taking us to a new stage of EU enlargement. Only once they have joined the EU will the Balkan countries, the infamous 'powder keg' of Europe, where the world wars were sparked off, be able to remove the barriers to cooperation between the citizens, the business structures and the cultural and scientific experts of the various states that have appeared there in recent years. It is important not to close the door to Turkey, which can be said to be Europe's link to the Muslim world. Turkey's rapprochement with the EU is changing this country in a good way and there is evidence of many positive steps to strengthen democracy and human rights. Although we are not yet discussing EU membership for Ukraine, Moldova or the countries of the South Caucasus in concrete terms, such a prospect in the future can contribute to stability, economic strengthening, reduced corruption and the consolidation of the rule of law in these countries.
in writing. - We vote against the motion for a resolution 'The Commission's 2009 enlargement strategy paper concerning the Western Balkan countries, Iceland and Turkey' by Gabriele Albertini, because we believe that neither Turkey nor the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows any progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria, nor do they demonstrate any political behaviour which would allow them to become EU members We hope to improve their efforts in order to meet the accession criteria, a fact that will be examined in the future. In any case, we do not wish to vote for a motion for a resolution that will give rise to vain hopes and will be used exclusively for internal consumption.
The motion for a resolution on the European Commission's current enlargement strategy is very balanced. It rewards the progress made by the accession candidates but, at the same time, clearly identifies the problems. Turkey, in particular, has taken a major step backwards. Therefore, I welcome the explicit criticism of the serious threats to, and genuine restrictions on, freedom of speech and of the press. The completely disproportionate tax penalty imposed on the opposition Dogan Media Group is a targeted attack against those who criticise the government. Objections have rightly been made to the discrimination against religious minorities and Turkey's refusal to implement the Ankara protocol. In addition, it is also important that we take a careful look at Turkish foreign policy. Its openness towards Armenia and the Kurds has so far been nothing more than gesture politics and has even been opposed by the Turkish parliament and by large sections of the population. The statements made by the Turkish Prime Minister also call into question Turkey's hoped-for role as a mediator between East and West. Turkey's flattery of the Iranian President, its invitation to the Sudanese President, who is wanted for genocide, to attend a conference, and its dealings with Israel, seem to indicate that it is turning away from the West. Therefore, our call for the Turkish Government to coordinate its foreign policy with that of the EU and to drop its objections to the cooperation between NATO and the EU is simply consistent.
in writing. - I am in favour of the EU being open to countries who meet the criteria for membership. I am concerned that this resolution presents enlargement as being imperative for the countries in question as well as the EU. It does not conceive of the possibility that it may be in the best interests of the countries concerned to remain outside the EU for a variety of social, economic or other reasons. EU membership is a big step for the countries concerned and it deserves the fullest possible debate and consultation involving the citizens of those countries. For this reason, I abstained.
The situation of this issue in Portugal is worrying. The number of crimes of domestic violence recorded by the Portuguese Association for Victim Support (APAV) has increased by 9% on the same period in 2008. According to the APAV, physical and psychological abuse, threats and sexual assaults have seen a major increase compared with the 2008 figures. Twenty-six women have died this year in Portugal already, as victims of domestic violence. Nonetheless, the vast majority of acts of violence are not reported through fear and shame.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the elimination of violence against women as I believe that the Commission and the Council need to consolidate EU action in this area. The EU urgently needs a more comprehensive policy on combating violence against women, specifically through the Commission drawing up a draft directive to ensure a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women, including trafficking. We should acknowledge and welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency makes this issue a priority in its plan of action.
It makes perfect sense for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality to remind us, as we mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, that, in spite of the countless legal instruments and UN declarations, not to mention the numerous resolutions in this Parliament made over many decades, we are still far from a situation of zero tolerance with regard to violence against women. There is no denying that violence by men against women is a violation of human rights and must be punished as such.
I welcome the vote in the European Parliament on the resolution for eliminating violence against women on this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. The declaration of this day by the UN in 1999 and the adoption of this resolution today are valuable instruments for reminding national governments of their obligations arising from the international treaties concerning the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. This is why I support this resolution, with an immediate request for Member States to reinforce their national legislations and policies on combating all forms of violence against women. At European Union level, it is particularly vital to guarantee assistance and support for all victims of violence, especially those affected by human trafficking, regardless of their nationality, as well as to ensure protection for women who are victims of domestic violence whose legal status might depend on their partner.
Somalia is one of the most blatant cases of the total breakdown of the central power and the return to a belligerent, tribal way of life, as the country is an epicentre of violence and instability which spreads far beyond its own borders. The coasts of Somalia have been constantly threatened by armed groups which not only fight for control of the coastal areas, but also carry out intolerable acts of piracy against other vessels, especially commercial, cargo, fishing, humanitarian aid and leisure boats.
I voted against Resolution because I think that piracy is not a military problem but a development problem. I therefore believe that the problem should be dealt with at its root, and that the solution cannot be a military one, either by land or by sea. The officer responsible for Operation Atalanta stated that a maritime solution is impossible, and that the situation in the area needs to be stabilised. I think we need to tackle the problem of governance, the stability of institutions and economic development in the region. However much we paper over the cracks, the problem will persist. By voting against the resolution, I also want to condemn the privatisation of the actions that are within the remit of the armed forces, as in Spain, private security companies are being allowed to go out on vessels with weapons of war. Moreover, I think we need to put an end to the pirates in Somalia, but also to the foreign pirates that are pillaging in Somali waters.
in writing. - The relative success of Operation Atalanta, now renewed for a year, underlines the fact that although the European Security and Defence Policy has the potential to achieve significant results for Member States, it is still unclear why NATO alone could not match this and thus avoid duplication. But piracy remains a clear and present danger in the seas around the Horn of Africa. We need to redouble efforts to defeat this menace, not only to protect our shipping, but to send a clear message of our resolve to the agents of al-Qaeda currently enjoying safe haven in Somalia.
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on a political solution to the problem of piracy off the Somali coast because sea piracy is a real problem and will continue to be a problem in waters off the Somali coast. The EU must protect maritime vessels passing through this region by means of international negotiations and protection measures. One part of the solution requires international support in bringing stability to Somalia. The other part of the solution is Operation Atalanta, recently launched by the EU in order to stop piracy off the Somali coast. Six frigates, three maritime patrol aircraft and 1 200 personnel from the United Kingdom, France and Greece will take part in the operation. Other states will contribute to the operation in the future. Operation Atalanta has succeeded in providing protection for high-risk cargos by escorting them. Thirty-six pirate vessels have been intercepted and 14 direct attacks have been avoided. However, to be able to enjoy the benefit of this escort, the responsible national bodies and the sea vessels must notify Operation Atalanta and request protection. It is vital that sea vessels avoid taking needless risks and request, on an official basis and in good time, protection from Operation Atalanta.
in writing. - We are in favour of robust international action to deal with piracy and have no doubt that the Royal Navy and allied navies from the US and other European nations will do a good job. However, we see no reason for the EU to run up its flag on a naval operation. We are opposed to the interference of the EU as an institution in defence matters. This brings no additional military capability and merely duplicates or adds complexity to the well-tried arrangements under NATO. Operation Atalanta was conceived as a political opportunity to add a maritime dimension to ESDP during the French Presidency. Despite the presence in the seas off the Horn of Africa of the US-led Combined Task Force 151 and a NATO Maritime Group, it was decided to concoct yet another fleet and a further command chain. We are also deeply concerned by proposals for an ESDP training mission to Somalia at a time when the EUPOL mission in Afghanistan has been a failure and many European countries have been unwilling to provide troops and police for urgent training missions in Afghanistan. Incidentally, we do not recognise such terminology as 'EU fishing vessels.'
I welcome this resolution enabling Parliament to support the Commission's highly voluntary anti-smoking policy. Exposure to cigarette smoke is the main cause of death and illness in Europe, with smoking imposing a heavy burden on health care systems as well. I hope that the Commission's measures will go further and that in the years to come, we will have the right to a healthy environment in all closed spaces and in the workplace. I cannot fail to mention that we still have a hypocritical policy in Europe. We want to have fewer health problems caused by smoking, however we support the retention of subsidies for cigarette manufacturers, even though they are gradually being reduced. I think that the common agricultural policy should be defined to reward products which help maintain and improve people's state of health, not jeopardise it. I hope that the Council meeting in December will discuss protection for children, especially in cases where they are exposed to smoking by adults in private cars or in other closed spaces. I believe that adults have a responsibility in this respect, and where the legislator can intervene, it must do so.
Having said this, I would still like to express two concerns. Firstly, are we heading towards a society that imposes blanket bans? What do we do about individual responsibility? I feel a sense of unease about a society resembling the one described by George Orwell in his novel '1984'. Secondly, if smokers have to be made to break their harmful habit for themselves and others, this must be done with the utmost respect. Tobacco is a drug. Banning it completely would be tantamount to denying that most smokers are in a state of dependency. A total ban may be regarded as an act of exclusion, which may prove to be counterproductive. Why, therefore, have we not provided the option of reserving areas specifically for them?
Firstly, I believe that smoke-free policies should be decided by the Member States and that the role of the European institutions, while respecting the subsidiarity principle, must remain at the level of non-binding recommendations. On the other hand, I also believe that Member States should promote smoke-free policies, but that they should not impose any restrictions on freedom of choice for operators, particularly in the hotel sector, where owners should have the option of being smoke-free or not. Against this backdrop, the act that was recently passed in Portugal was a well balanced one.
I do think, however, that these actions should be implemented by each Member State, in the first instance. The original text of the resolution mixed up and confused the production of tobacco with its consumption. I therefore welcome the adoption of the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which removes part of item 9 from the original text, deleting the references to the production of tobacco. These two changes have improved the final resolution. I consider the remaining points positive, so I have voted in favour.
Mr President, I voted in favour, though I would have liked to see a tougher resolution. Smoking is the greatest single cause of premature deaths in Europe. Tobacco smoke is an environmental pollutant that contains over a hundred compounds that do harm to the health. Nevertheless, parts of Europe allow not just users of tobacco but those around them to be exposed to it. Passive smoking is a moral problem, because those who suffer have no choice. It is necessary, in particular, to protect children.
Studies suggest that a child whose parent uses tobacco actually 'smokes' every fourth cigarette that his or her parent smokes. Every year, smoking leads to the premature death of almost 100 000 Europeans. Many Member States have already implemented some excellent measures. When Finland finally also banned smoking in restaurants and bars there was an outcry. Now, two years later, people are only grateful. That reflects the nature of public health policy: lasting results might be achieved through prevention and awareness-raising, but it takes the resolve of the legislators to deal with the resistance. I disagree with some of the other Members here that the Community does not need binding legislation on health and safety at work. It needs to be recognised that the recommendations have not been sufficient everywhere. I do support paragraph 13 of the resolution, in which the Commission is urged to put forward a legislative proposal for smoking to be banned in indoor workplaces and also on public transport.
Smoking is expensive for society, and, furthermore, the 70% of Europeans who do not smoke end up paying the bill. I therefore agree with the view that Parliament expressed in 2007 that the content of the Tobacco Products Directive needs to be made more stringent and incorporate the liability of the manufacturers for the costs of health care due to the consumption of tobacco. The Union first needs to take the mote out of its own eye. It is high time we brought the gradual phasing out of subsidies for tobacco farming to a complete end.
Mr President, I voted for the resolution supporting smoke-free environments because I believe that it is vitally important to monitor the progress being made towards the widespread introduction of smoke-free environments in the European Union and to facilitate the exchange of good practice between Member States and the coordination of the policy for protecting citizens against the risks of smoking. I also voted in favour of keeping paragraph 9, declaring the end by 2010 of the direct production-linked subsidies for tobacco growing because of its implication for health issues. I also support my fellow Members from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who have reminded us that smoking remains the number one identified cause of death and illness in the European Union. Thank you, Mr President.
I cannot promise them miracles, but we are working in collaboration with our government to devise measures which will not allow them to be left without any choice, having lost their principal means of livelihood. Fellow Members, I can understand the arguments of those who are campaigning against smoking. However, I urge you to ensure that we do not mix up the fight against smoking with the risk of us destroying tobacco growing in Europe. I call on you at a time of economic crisis to ensure that we remain prudent and wise.
They believe therefore that Europe does not have its place in this debate and provides no added value in terms of guaranteeing European citizens healthy areas in all public places, at work and on public transport. In other words, they are not bothered about discrimination being created among workers in Europe. Just to give one example, people in Ireland will be very well protected by a national law, while we can only wonder if, one day, people in Greece or the Czech Republic will have this chance, or rather this right.
The proposal in the resolution dealing with non-smoking areas envisaged a considerable change - the imposition of a smoking ban in pan-European public institutions and public spaces. The intention of the resolution was to task the Commission with preparing the necessary legislative act, which would come into effect in 2011. Although very many delegates, including myself, voted for a ban on smoking in public rooms (in particular, workplaces), the People's Party unfortunately took an opposing position. The majority of Parliament has not shown any consideration for protecting the health of every European citizen and, in particular, those people who do not smoke themselves, and yet are forced to breathe in smoke in public spaces and, as a result, suffer health problems themselves. I hope that this subject does not end up in oblivion, and also that it goes up the current agenda once more, since many Member States have not thus far imposed a ban on smoking in public places, although they have had the opportunity to do so.
I share the concern, through this resolution, of making progress in the battle against passive smoking imposed on those who do not smoke. However, some people are taking advantage of the situation to insert a provision in this resolution opposing the subsidies paid to tobacco growers. I am personally in favour of providing this support to those practising what is a dying art. You should be aware that tobacco accounts for less than 10% of what goes into cigarettes; are so many questions asked about the additives that account for more than 90% of their content, and about their harmfulness?
in writing. - Given that over 40 million people die of hunger and poverty each year, including one child every six seconds, and that the global food crisis is one of the major threats to peace and security in the world, I have voted to support this timely Resolution. The Resolution calls for the Commission to conduct a full impact assessment of the EU's policies and programmes in the areas of agriculture, development and trade in order to guarantee a coherent, sustainable policy approach to global food security. As the Resolution stated everyone has the right to safe and nutritious food, the European Union must act to ensure these policies can deliver sustainable food security.
There is a strange situation in the world today: a billion people are suffering from obesity, yet at the same time, a billion people are starving. This situation is disastrous and requires effective measures, particularly on the part of the wealthy European Union. However, we do not believe that the EU's common agricultural policy, as it currently stands, is the solution. Our agricultural policy has been successful in the past, but it has no place in the future. Since this resolution opposes the revision of the current European system for agricultural aid (something that could benefit the climate, the world's poor and Europe's farmers), we could see no other alternative than to abstain from the vote.
I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the FAO World Summit on Food Security - Eradicating hunger from the face of the earth, because I believe that urgent measures are necessary to put a stop to this scourge, which affects a sixth of the world's population. In light of the impact of climate change on agriculture, particularly reduced productivity due to water scarcity, especially in countries which are already struggling with these problems, we must ensure that we develop coherent agricultural policies that are consistent with protecting the climate and fighting hunger.
However, we would like to point out that we do not share Parliament's view that we should not reduce market support measures and aid payments to farmers within the framework of the EU's common agricultural policy. We do not believe that these support measures and payments will help to bring increased security of food supply to developing countries in the long term. On the contrary, these measures will have the opposite effect. Subsidised, cheap European food is being exported to developing countries and, on account of its competitive prices, it often knocks these countries' own food production out of the market, so denying these countries the chance of more long-term self-sufficiency.
We, the Danish Liberal Party's MEPs, voted in favour of the resolution on food security as we want to emphasise the importance of the EU taking global responsibility in the fight against hunger and poverty. We are opposed to paragraph 9 of the resolution, however, which puts question marks against the continued liberalisation of EU agricultural policy. The Danish Liberal Party wants to see a gradual abolition of agricultural aid plus the establishment of common rules that ensure a level playing field for Europe's farmers in terms of competition.
Therefore, perfectly functioning ecosystems, fertile soil, stable water resources and further diversification of the rural economy are the highest priorities. International cooperation and solidarity, together with balanced trade agreements which promote, rather than jeopardise, food security are an essential element of global food security and this is where a strong CAP can make an important contribution. Net food importing countries are hardest hit by rising food prices, yet many of these countries throughout the world are the least developed. The EU must take measures to counteract this.
The authors of this resolution, although forced to highlight the problem of hunger and the problems raised at the Food and Agricultural Summit in general, have nonetheless concealed the basic cause of the problem, namely the capitalist system of exploitation and the strategy which the EU also loyally serves so that capital can profit. The food production and distribution multinationals are uprooting farmers and concentrating the land, thereby striking a heavy blow at poor and average farmers. The working and grassroots classes, even in developed capitalist countries, are finding it harder and harder to safeguard healthy, safe food, while the food multinationals are raking in massive profits and buying up huge swathes of land, especially in Africa, calculating that food production needs to double by 2050. The EU leads the way in the liberalisation and privatisation of all food production factors - water, energy, transport and technology - and is imposing the same on third countries through the WTO and bilateral agreements.
Ortega was elected President in elections in 2006. The Sandinistas returned to power. From the very outset, he began to use the tried and tested methods of intimidation and elimination, under a variety of pseudo-legal pretexts, of any kind of political competition. The Sandinista apparatus began to duplicate state apparatus, following the example of the Cuban Committees for the Defence of the Revolution. In December 2008, the European Parliament drew attention to the campaign of harassment being perpetrated by state authorities, parties and people associated with the Sandinistas against human rights organisations and their members, journalists and representatives of the media. Amnesty International wrote of the violence which followed local authority elections. Attacks and beatings of journalists multiplied.
I will remind you that on 19 October, the Supreme Court decided to remove constitutional obstacles which prevented President Ortega from standing for a further term of office. The fact of this change itself is not outrageous, because, of course, there is no such law in many European countries, but what is outrageous is the way in which this decision was made. As we all know, President Ortega does not have a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and so he had to turn to violating the constitution in order to remove the ban on his re-election. If we allow Daniel Ortega to run for President again in 2011, we may wake up in a situation in which Nicaragua is controlled by a real dictatorship.
author. - Mr President, I am very thankful for the support in this House for the delegation of Liberal International which I led to Managua. We came in peace on the invitation of a parliamentary majority to speak about the Constitution, the election, the election campaign and human rights and civil liberties. We were cursed, we were called pirates and that kind of thing. We were threatened with expulsion from the country, threatened with being persona non grata, and it was said that we were staging a golpe - a coup d'état.
But, more importantly than that, they cursed my country and they oppress their own people. I think that the European Union should monitor what happens in Nicaragua and should send observers to the elections in 2011 and support the democratic opposition. I also hope that we will do the same and will be objective regarding the result of the election in Honduras. Let us see whether the elections on Sunday are free and fair, and let us make a decision then. It could be that, if we recognise the result of the elections, it will put an end to the constitutional crisis in that country.
Having said this and on a more serious note, I would like to say on behalf of my group that we are not getting involved in this game. What I mean is that, while the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) refused us an urgent debate on Uganda about the laws against homosexuals and another urgent debate on Iran about the executions being carried out there, they would now like us to get involved in the game of being for or against Ortega, with the demonstrations going on over there.
Mr President, along the same lines, I think that it is not only sad but clearly shameful that a sitting as important as this, on urgent matters, is being manipulated in this way, and I am therefore surprised not only that the subject today is Nicaragua, but also that on other occasions when we were supposed to have discussed much more serious matters, that did not happen. Today, moreover, we have the added factor that other subjects that were on the agenda have been dropped precisely because this one has been included. This is entirely inappropriate from the point of view of the content of debates on urgent matters.
Most importantly, however, I would like to highlight the fact that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation in Germany, a foundation which has close links with the German Free Democratic Party, was involved in the coup in Honduras. There was a debate about this at least in Germany. The foundation's scholarship holders distanced themselves from this policy in an open letter. We must not forget that Mr van Baalen is the president of Liberal International and on the website of the Friedrich-Naumann foundation, it states that he discussed the possibility of a coup with the armed forces in Nicaragua. I think it is appropriate that in these circumstances - and this has not been contradicted - a country such as Nicaragua is bold enough to expel a politician of this kind. In all honesty, we must admit that the situation would be just the same in Europe.
I do not understand why it is not urgent to take the floor, discussing the issue of the treatment of one of the Members of this Parliament who has visited a country exercising his right as President of Liberal International. I do not understand why we cannot take the floor and speak about this issue and also speak about this new tendency in Latin America to try to change arbitrarily the constitution of the country and stop a tradition that has always existed concerning one or two terms of office of the Head of State in that country.
(LT) I wholeheartedly support the opinion of my group that this matter should not be included on the agenda, as there are much more relevant and much more pressing problems throughout the world. If we are to discuss Nicaragua, we should firstly talk about the fact that this is a country with the highest debt in the world and that it is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. The communist experiment was not the answer there, but neither was the neo-liberal experiment. It is a country where there was too much interference by the superpowers, America and the Soviet Union, and that is why that country is constantly on the verge of civil war. It is understandable that there are strong-arm tendencies there and those must be condemned. However, let us not forget that we also have strong-arm tendencies in Europe. Therefore, let us concentrate on far more important matters.
My third point is that it was said that Mr van Baalen was accused of discussing a coup and this is why he was expelled from the country. If you cannot openly discuss all kinds of subjects - for us this is part of the freedom of the press and of speech, two freedoms which we have here and which we value highly - is this really a reason for expelling someone from the country, simply because a subject of whatever kind was discussed? The fact that this happens in public is no justification for expelling someone from the country, simply because a discussion took place. This is totally the wrong approach.
In this respect, he is no different from his fellow leftist Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. Both men have made their names denouncing caudillos, but they themselves are turning into caudillos of the Left and, as such, represent a genuine threat to regional democratic stability, especially given the chaos in nearby Honduras. Daniel Ortega has failed his people and his country many times over. If we truly believe in democracy and freedom, we cannot ignore the plight of the citizens of Nicaragua.
There was criticism last week in the Development Council that there were no previous discussions on this with the Member States. Without going into the details of this, I think it is very important that, when we take that kind of decision, we have a kind of a procedure whereby we at least try to make sure that the European Commission and the Member States are taking the same line with respect to individual states. If, in the end, it is not possible, then of course everybody is allowed to do what he or she thinks to be necessary.
I would like to mention just one case which I think is typical, that of Mrs Tran Khai Thanh Thuy. She is a writer, blogger, journalist and activist who is currently in prison for vague reasons, the most plausible of which is that she was defending freedom of expression and human rights in her country. She is diabetic and in a poor state of health. We fear for her life and are demanding not only adequate health care for her in prison, but also her immediate release.
Mr President, the human rights situation in Vietnam is disturbing. Religious persecution, in particular of Christians and Buddhists, is the order of the day. Anyone who speaks out in favour of freedom and human rights is intimidated and kept under systematic surveillance. At the end of September, hundreds of monks from the Bat Nha monastery were attacked. Major damage was caused to the entire monastery complex while the police simply sat by and watched. The monks who sought refuge in the nearby Phuoc Hue temple were beaten up. This sort of abuse must not be tolerated. It is outrageous that the numerous calls from the European Union and other parts of the world for improvements in the human rights situation have simply been ignored. There are hundreds of reasons for at last introducing changes, particularly as next year, Vietnam will hold the presidency of the ASEAN group of countries.
The 5 000 Hmong refugees who are currently living in camps in northern Thailand and who are a persecuted minority are also in an appalling situation. They have not been granted the status of refugees. The organisation 'Doctors without Borders', which was represented here in Parliament this week, has said that it is almost impossible for it to provide humanitarian aid in the camps because people are constantly and generally completely arbitrarily being arrested and forced to return to Laos. Any claims that these people are returning voluntarily are simply not true.
The position of religious communities seems to be becoming more and more difficult in Vietnam. We really have to condemn the fact that more than 300 monks and nuns from two monasteries had to leave as a result of violence and that religious communities are continually being harassed. It is important that Vietnam takes notice of the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which propose, for example, that United Nations Special Rapporteurs be invited to the country to monitor the implementation of freedom of opinion and religion, as well as other basic human rights.
Mr President, negotiations which are in progress on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties. The information reaching us shows that the situation in this regard in Vietnam is extremely disturbing, especially in relation to the repression being used against internet users. The internet is a medium which is founded on free exchange of information and views on every subject, and that on a world scale. Meanwhile, Vietnamese legal regulations on use of the internet penalise free speech in areas considered as sensitive, such as human rights and the propagation of democracy.
(PL) Mr President, in this Parliament, we spoke of Vietnam, particularly in the context of the religious persecution of Buddhists, in the previous Parliamentary term. Today, the time has come to talk once again about the violation of religious rights in both of those countries, this time against Christians. This is, unfortunately, a permanent feature of political reality in these two countries. The European Parliament, which is so sensitive to violations of human rights and the rights of minorities, must make a statement on this matter.
(PL) Mr President, we should note with satisfaction every measure which is intended to stress the importance of human rights and to highlight instances in which they are not observed in some parts of the world, in countries where people's fundamental rights are violated. When, however, we turn our attention to the violation of these rights, we must pay particular attention to those situations in particular countries in which there are violations of the rights of people of different religions and of their right to free expression of their faith and attachment in the area of religious liberty, and to demonstrate their convictions in this realm. Therefore, we should raise the alarm in every instance of drastic violations in this area.
We should also remember that, here in Europe, we should always be an example of a place on the world map which remains a model of great tradition, liberty, freedom and respect for other religions. This is why it is with a certain unease that I notice something. It is something which cannot, of course, be compared to the facts referred to here in this Chamber. I am thinking of a trend which is appearing in the judicial decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, which seems to encroach on the area of freedom of religion and the traditions of particular countries, in this case, the ruling on Italy and crosses. I think that rulings of this kind may also create a certain bad atmosphere, where some symbols and emphases are open to misinterpretation.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission maintains that in recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the general political situation in Laos, and agrees with Parliament that the ratification by Laos of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a welcome step towards respect for the freedoms of faith, association, speech and the press. The Commission also welcomes the ratification of the Convention on Disability Rights and the UN Convention against Corruption.
However, we share the concerns of Parliament regarding political prisoners. As to the three individuals mentioned by Parliament, the authorities repeated in October 2009 their earlier statement to our delegation in Vientiane, namely that Mr Keochay had already been released in 2002. Two of the other three, Mr Seng-Aloun Phengphanh and Mr Tongpaseuth Keuakaoun, were reported to be in good health. The authorities claim to have no knowledge of Mr Bouvanh Chanmanivong.
Mr President, my group has withdrawn its signature from the 'China' resolution. Why? Not because we regard human rights as secondary and subordinate to commercial interests - after all, we submitted a resolution from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament without any concession, highlighting our commitment - but because, in order to achieve a change in China's behaviour, we need to have dialogue, and this erratic resolution devoid of any structure ruins any chance of dialogue. It certainly has everything in it: Tibet, the Dalai Lama and his succession, the religious crusade and even, in case anything had been missed out, criticism of any present, past and future Communist regime.
Recently a Socialist colleague of my own was banned from China. Laurence Coates, a Socialist who writes under the name of Vincent Kolo, who is the editor of 'chinaworker.info', was detained at the border and banned from China. 'Chinaworker.info' campaigns for workers' rights and free trade unions. We should stand with workers in China. Independent and democratically-run trade unions and the right to strike should be campaigned for, as well as the release of all political prisoners and detained labour activists.
However, sadly, China is the world leader in executions. In 2008 alone, at least 1 718 people were executed. The estimated number of unreported cases is much higher. Even the minimum figure means that China is responsible for more than 70% of all executions throughout the world. In addition, China has increased the number of crimes liable to the death penalty. This means that Chinese people can be executed for committing more than 68 crimes. That is why we are calling in this resolution for China to suspend its planned executions and introduce a moratorium on the death penalty immediately.
The administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people, systematic torture in prisons, religious and political repression, executions - all these methods are incompatible with the People's Republic of China's obligations as a member of the United Nations. Moreover, they are ineffective methods, which will not succeed in silencing or containing those who clamour for freedom and human rights. This is the case in China, just like the rest of the world, for the Chinese are not Martians; they are no different to people elsewhere.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we, as Liberals, are against the death penalty in general, but here the death penalty in China is used to oppress minorities, like the Tibetans, the Uighurs and others. Furthermore, China is not a democracy. Human rights are not respected. China has a harsh policy against Taiwan. China should be put under pressure. This is difficult, I know. It is an enormous market, but we should fight for our principles. Therefore, we support this resolution.
It is, in fact, impossible to imagine that China would act any differently in this respect from any other nation which has had to recognise the fact that, in order to develop its society, it needs all those creative forces that it now oppresses and tyrannises. If we believe that human rights are universal, we really cannot regard China as the exception, as Mrs Gomes remarked - and I quite agree with her. So let us apply the same yardstick to China as we do other countries.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I have been a long-standing critic in this House of the lack of human rights in the People's Republic of China. I have criticised the bullying of peaceful Taiwan in excluding this country from all international organisations, including the World Health Organisation. I have criticised the repression of peaceful Tibetan culture, the persecution of Falun Gong, as well as other religious minorities, and the presence of widespread censorship in China, including the media and also the internet and Google.
(LT) I would hope that in the 21st century, the death penalty will die out and that the instruments of the death penalty will only be found in a museum. However, until then, there is still a long road to travel, and I hope that China resolutely follows that road. For several decades, China has led in terms of the rate of economic growth, but sadly also in terms of execution statistics. Of course, Beijing would say that there is no other way in such a huge country and that not even the USA has abolished the death penalty. However, despite this, if we are seriously considering a strategic partnership between the European Union and China that would be very important to both parties, then Beijing should undoubtedly change its policy regarding the implementation of the death penalty, as well as its policy on dialogue between ethnic minorities, for the sake of their harmonious coexistence.
(DE) Mr President, the question of human rights and respect for minority rights has been a constant source of conflict for years, if not for decades, in the relationship between the European Union and the People's Republic of China. The situation of the minorities in particular worsened after the end of the Olympic Games and the Tibetans and the Uighurs have been subjected to strong pressure over recent months. For this reason, I cannot understand why my fellow Members do not want paragraph 9 to be included in the resolution, because this would encourage peaceful dialogue rather than the prevailing oppression.
(DE) Mr President, I have already mentioned in this House that the World Uighur Congress, the central organisation for free Uighurs, is based in Munich, for the same reason that thankfully many Czechs and many other people lived in Munich: because Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were also located there. The city still retains this spirit of freedom today. At the same time, Franz-Josef Strauß, who always defended these freedom radio stations against calls for their closure, ensured that we developed a relationship with China very early on. The two things are not mutually exclusive, but complementary: positive contacts with China, but clear defence of religious freedom and human rights.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse what Reinhard Bütikofer has said. My group had proposed that we discuss the imminent executions of the Uighurs in China and the participants in the protest demonstrations against the fraudulent elections in Iran who had been condemned to death, because these are two countries where executions are likely to take place very soon and, therefore, an urgent debate is needed. It is true that the Chinese hold the world record for executions, as you have said, and that the Chinese regime is unjust, because it disregards human rights. I would like to state explicitly that this is an intolerable situation.
However, in the Conference of Presidents, we asked for the two things to be kept separate: the urgent issues which we are discussing now, in other words, the imminent executions, and the question of the relationship between the European Union and China on economic, cultural, political and defence issues and in other areas. We want to discuss this in a debate on the EU-China Summit and to summarise it in a resolution. This is why the mishmash that has come out of this has nothing to do with urgent issues. This is also why our group is insisting on a vote on the urgent matter which we proposed and not on the hotchpotch that you have submitted.
(HU) Mr President, it is a major event that this issue has been urgently included on the agenda now. The group of Hungarian MEPs from Transylvania also proposed this issue for discussion. We want to thank some of the groups for their participation and support, but we are surprised that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament withdrew its signature from this proposal for a decision. I regret that at the meeting the day before yesterday, certain sections were removed from the draft text as a whole, namely, those relating to the criticism of Communist regimes and the protection of minority communities. The EU should finally face up honestly and openly to Communism's enduring legacy and to Communist regimes still surviving today, which includes China.
Many people hoped that China would show more respect for human rights as a result of the Olympic Games and also that, because the Chinese are aware that the eyes of the world are on them, they would commit fewer abuses of human rights. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. The executions have continued and, therefore, it is very important for us to discuss this today, following the executions in November of nine Uighurs, which many people in the world are completely unaware of, and before that of two Tibetans.
The summit between the EU and China is not far off and, as several of the previous speakers have mentioned, China is an important trading partner. This is what makes it so difficult to bring up the breaches of human rights repeatedly, but that is why it is particularly important to talk about this subject today in the run-up to the summit. We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere. It is good that Parliament introduced a moratorium on the death penalty in 2007 and we must do everything we can to keep this subject in the forefront of people's minds while the death penalty is still in place.
(PL) Mr President, as a Pole, I always feel my heart beat faster when there is talk of human rights in China. On 4 June 1989, Poles regained their liberty by voting in the first free election, in which we returned a non-communist Prime Minister. The same day, 4 June 1989, the Chinese regime crushed protesting students under the caterpillar tracks of its tanks in Tiananmen Square. The free world had found a recipe for overcoming Soviet communism, but had not found one for overcoming Chinese communism.
I fear that if we put off making a resolution, we will unduly restrict this matter. Of course, abuse of the death penalty is a horrible crime, but there are also arrests. People are killed in labour camps in China, people are beaten with cudgels, they are imprisoned, freedom of speech is stifled, there is censorship. This should all be found in this resolution. It is good that the resolution has been tabled, but most important of all is that the primacy of human rights values should be victorious over economics. That is what I wish for everyone.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first outline the state of play in EU-China relations. Our policy towards China is one of constructive engagement. As two major actors on the global stage, our strategic partnership is increasingly focused on addressing global challenges. A key goal of the 12th EU-China Summit, to be held on 30 November in Nanjing, will precisely be to work together to ensure success for the Copenhagen climate summit and to address EU-China relations, including human rights, the financial and economic crisis and other international issues.
My colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, had an extensive debate with you on Tibet in March, where she outlined the EU's position. I would like to recall some essential elements that the EU position encompasses. We have always supported the dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Dalai Lama. For the EU, human rights are universal, and the situation in Tibet is a legitimate concern of the international community. Tibet's situation has invariably been approached as such. We have consistently passed this message to our Chinese counterparts and listened very carefully to their views.
The EU respects China's right to bring those responsible for violent action to justice but reaffirms its long-standing universal opposition to the use of the death penalty, under all circumstances, as well as the importance it attaches to the right to have a fair trial. The EU has raised these concerns repeatedly with the Chinese authorities and reiterates its concerns in the two declarations published on 29 October and on 13 November, as it always does in such situations. The statements called on China to commute any other death penalties passed in connection with the disturbances in Tibet and Xinjiang. Moreover, the EU will continue to press to be allowed to observe any further trials arising from Tibet and the Xinjiang disturbances.
We all share the goal of a more open, transparent China, adhering to international standards on human rights and working together to address global challenges. We all hoped that the Olympic Games would be the start of more Chinese flexibility with respect to the human rights of individuals. Up to now, this has not materialised. We must continue to work on the development of our strategic partnership and the respect of human rights as an integral part of our continued dialogue. The 12th EU-China Summit in Beijing is a privileged occasion to do so at an important stage of our respective evolution.
China has recently said goodbye to US President Barack Obama and will soon say hello to European Council President Fredrik Reinfeldt. We must, however, see more action than just diplomatic gestures. China has stated to its own people and the world its commitment to human rights, including those of the minorities residing within its borders. Nevertheless, their record speaks otherwise. Lately, there have been a number of disturbing incidents involving executions that were conducted with questionable trials and with uncommon haste. These activities were all conducted in secrecy. There is also the serious case of the Uighur minorities, where the Chinese Government is implementing birth control policies that are phasing the group out. As the European Union speaks out for minority rights and abhors the death penalty, we urge the Chinese Government to open up the process by which citizens are tried and sentenced to death, and commute the sentences of those who were not given fair and open trials. We urge the Chinese authorities to respect the rights of minorities living within their borders with regard to both UN resolutions and their own constitution. We also urge China to improve its human rights with the support of the international community.
Only recently, I was on a visit to Pakistan, where I met the President, the Prime Minister and prominent ministers to discuss human rights and the fight against terrorism. I would say that sometimes in our resolutions on human rights, we also need to mention the good news. There is cause for that now. A year ago, Pakistan's new democratically elected government appointed the first Minister for Minorities, who himself represents the Christian minority. The government's achievements in this area have been significant: the country has approved a 5% quota of public offices reserved for minorities, religious festivals for minorities have been made official, minorities are to have their own special day of celebration on 11 August, and the Senate is planning the same 5% quota for that institution.
The most important project relates to the reduction in incidences of violence. Minorities together with Muslims are forming local 'inter-faith harmony' committees, whose purpose it will be to soothe tensions and improve dialogue between the various groups. There will be one in 112 local areas. Ideally, they will also be able to prevent recruitment by the Taliban very effectively. Pakistan is the most crucial country in terms of global security. If the government succeeds in eliminating terrorism by such peaceful means as these, the example will be worth following. The situation should be interesting to watch.
With your permission, I would also like to mention an anniversary which is important to me personally. Yesterday, it was 28 years since the imposition of martial law in Poland by the then Communist authorities. As a result, almost 100 people lost their lives, including the nine miners who were shot during the strike at the Wujek Mine. Many thousands of democratic opposition activists were interned, and others were even imprisoned. This was intended to break up and destroy the Solidarity trade union. I refer to these events because I would like to draw attention to how greatly Europe has changed in the past two or three decades, but also to how we ought to strive for peace and human rights in our continent and throughout the world.
I would also like to take the opportunity to remind you that on Wednesday at 12.00, a ceremony will be held to present the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. This year, the prize has been awarded to Lyudmila Alexeyeva, Sergei Kovalev and Oleg Orlov, who represent the Russian human rights defence organisation Memorial. Our continent experienced very great suffering during the 20th century, so we understand very well the importance of striving for human rights around the world, and especially in the continent of Europe. This event, therefore, holds particular value for us.
We are ardent opponents of Mr Berlusconi, but we are political adversaries. We do not view Mr Berlusconi, or any other opponent, as our enemy. There is no other way to fight and win except through political and civil battle. We will not allow anyone to force the liveliness of political debate down a dangerous road of hate and violence, which is the first step towards authoritarian and antidemocratic practices. It is right that, once again, this Parliament shows its superior equanimity, respect and democratic maturity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several urgent matters are scheduled for next Thursday. As the third of these urgent matters, we are due to discuss the situation in Azerbaijan. The media, including the Western media, have reported on a scuffle that involved two young bloggers and another two people in a public place. An arrest was made and a sentence handed down and I believe it is only right to get to the bottom of the matter and ascertain whether everything has been done in accordance with the law.
We would like to point out, once again, that the assistance provided by the Globalisation Adjustment Fund should not replace measures which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, or measures for restructuring companies or sectors. For us, there still remains one point of criticism - and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will certainly not let up in this - and that is that payment appropriations are clearly being systematically transferred from the European Social Fund, but the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is ultimately a separate and specific instrument with its own objectives and deadlines.
The total amount in question for these three applications that we are talking about today and on which we must take a decision this week is EUR 15.9 million. In this regard, the Swedish and Dutch applications are based on Article 2(a) of the legal basis, namely at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State. The Austrian application is based on Article 2(b), namely at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises. As I said, the Swedish application relates to a total of 4 687 redundancies at the car manufacturer Volvo and 23 of its suppliers and downstream producers. Sweden has applied for EUR 9.8 million from the Fund for this.
In accordance with the Commission's assessment, which, after thorough examination, we are also able to support, the applications fulfil the eligibility criteria set. Without wanting to pre-empt my colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to point out that this committee, as has also been agreed in the procedure here, will issue an opinion prior to the decision by the Committee on Budgets and it will also look at the details very closely. For example, it has pointed out that, in the Swedish case, of the 4 687 redundancies mentioned, only 1 500 are targeted to receive the assistance.
The first budgetary point you raise relates to funding sources. You tell us that the European Social Fund cannot be the only source of funding. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is, from a budgetary perspective, a special instrument which does not have its own resources. Resources must be transferred before they can be released which firstly means identifying budget items that offer suitable opportunities and secondly, proposing to the budgetary authority that the sums identified in this way be released via a budget amendment. This activity is performed on a case-by-case basis, according to need.
It is true that the European Social Fund has been the main source of funding so far. This is not merely a result of the similar nature of this fund. It is largely down to the fact that the fund has significant resources at its disposal. In 2009, the European Social Fund has almost EUR 11 billion available in resources for payments. By the end of November, EUR 6 billion of this overall amount had been used. The total volume of payments to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund represents EUR 53 million in 2009, i.e. 0.5% of the allocated budgetary resources of the European Social Fund. Up until now, the method we have chosen and which was, from a certain viewpoint, logical and easier than other methods, did not delay or put at risk fulfilment of the objectives of the European Social Fund. Nevertheless, however, I agree that it is necessary to diversify the sources of payments and I can assure you that the Commission is addressing this issue. I hope therefore that we will be able to present a number of possible scenarios to you next time.
The second point you raise is not exclusively budget-related, but relates rather to decision making, since you ask that in future, the Commission submit its proposals for releasing resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in individual documents. The Commission is aware of the advantages of this case-by-case approach, which would completely eliminate the risk of secret agreements or guarantees, for example. It is true that the method originally used was an entirely normal approach which, to a certain extent, facilitated administrative handling of the problems, but in my opinion, the pragmatic and political fundamentals speak very strongly in favour of a case-by-case approach and the Commission will use this method from now on.
Mr President, unusual times call for unusual measures. With its Globalisation Adjustment Fund, a very special bespoke instrument, Europe is matching its words with deeds. The mass redundancy of more than 700 regular workers at Dutch construction company Heijmans N.V. - not to mention the numbers abroad, for example in Belgium and the United Kingdom - calls for targeted action. The construction sector occupies an important place in the Brabant region, which is also my home region, and the effects of this kind of mass redundancy are palpable far beyond the region itself.
Europe's action is rightly aimed at preserving expertise and skills. The crisis has meant people now losing their jobs even though experience has taught us that there is a great shortage of skilled professionals, particularly in construction. A mobility centre, along with the preservation of expertise and also of jobs where possible, is a good choice of instrument for Heijmans, therefore. The Dutch ministries and also the regional authorities, for example, those in the province of North Brabant, are now working to accelerate highly targeted investment in projects, infrastructure and construction. We are seeking thus to show the people losing their jobs that we are providing active input, including in financial terms.
I would again point out - this week in particular, against the backdrop of Copenhagen - that we are in particularly urgent need of energy supplies and energy measures in the fields of construction and also of transport. We have amended the rules in Parliament in other fields - I would draw your attention in this connection to the accelerated disbursements and advances from regional funds - and so an active contribution by Parliament must be supported. A company such as Heijmans, which always focuses on continuity and quality, would also profit from this. It is in that spirit that we give these three proposals, particularly the one concerning Heijmans, our wholehearted support.
This shows that, in the face of the crisis, within this institution of the European Parliament, when political goodwill is present, high-quality political instruments are made available to our fellow citizens. Political goodwill can still do its work, since, on reading the report by Mr Böge, I find that the essential points for improving the fund's operation are there: speeding up the handling of requests in order to be responsive in the face of the crisis, ceasing to present requests jointly, and using funding other than from the European Social Fund.
I have taken a quick look at the gender breakdown of the three programmes targeted for assistance and they run 91%, 72% and 79% male. I have looked at some of the other programmes that we have funded before this, and there seems to be an indication that there is a much greater percentage of the funding going towards male workers that have been made redundant. This may be a statistical aberration or it may be a situation where, for one reason or another, a greater number of the applications are for male workers.
Yet I should like to seize this opportunity to draw attention to a major shortcoming of the EGF. We are currently developing a shared vision of the future of the economy and the labour market in Europe. The various political groupings in this House may not fully agree on how exactly to do this or how far to go in this regard, but we are in reasonable agreement on the broad lines. More sustainability and more inclusiveness are required. If we wish to achieve these objectives, we must seize the opportunities now. At this very time, when tackling the crisis, we must take action that brings us closer to this sustainable economy.
In my opinion, we are letting some opportunities go to waste with the present mobilisation of the EGF. It is a crying shame that the fund, one of our instruments to confront the crisis, is not pointing the way forward. We must dare to make real choices. If we ensure that people who are now losing their jobs in polluting industries such as the car industry are retrained for work in sustainable sectors with a view to the future rather than remaining stuck in the past, this will make clear what direction we want to move in, and will also bring the innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy that bit closer.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing further cases involving the release of funding from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. It is a question of whether money is available to meet requests from the governments of Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands in connection with layoffs in firms operating in the automobile and construction industries. We have approved a number of similar contributions in the past. In my opinion, however, this is an incorrect measure and the European Union should not continue with it. I would like to present two arguments in support of this position.
Firstly, this is an unjust measure. Globalisation, or rather competitive pressure, applies to almost all employees and employers in small businesses in the EU. As a result of this, many jobs are both lost and created every day in Europe. Support relating to job losses, however, is provided in the EU at a European level only in the case of large companies where the job losses are sufficiently high. People made redundant from small firms cannot access this form of support and it is therefore a selective and ultimately unjust measure.
However, this represents a piecemeal approach. Subsidising the training of those who have lost their jobs in certain industries will not resolve the situation of the said industries, nor will it help to create an alternative industry that will absorb this workforce. This is just a waste of taxpayers' money. If the European Union was really looking to help Europe out of the crisis, it should be investigating and working on the causes of the crisis, but it prefers to be seen as the charity that will come to rescue the poor.
Of course, this action will initially return support for the European Union from those affected. Moreover, the report and the motion for a resolution being proposed for vote do not indicate what the scope of this subsidy will be - i.e. how many industries it will cover and how many companies within a certain industry. What is most worrying is that the report emphasises the need to speed up the payments of the subsidies, without ever mentioning the need to provide evidence that the funds are reaching the right people for the right purpose. Worse still, the report does not call for regular monitoring of the effects of the subsidy, leaving this evaluation to the general assessment of the programmes within the process of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the European Union has a budgetary instrument that provides financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns. Now, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is also providing direct assistance to people affected in my home country. I have pointed out on many occasions that the Globalisation Adjustment Fund must not be wrongly seen as a backup solution for multinational companies, but must go directly to help the citizens affected. For that reason, I am in favour of control mechanisms and would like to see regular progress reports from Steiermark. This fund is utilised precisely where society needs it most, namely to help the affected people themselves. That is something positive that the European Union does for its citizens.
I am grateful that the focus here is on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. I believe that transitional assistance is particularly important to allow them to continue working and to be able to take advantage of any appropriate new opportunities on the markets. We should carefully analyse the results of this funding to see where we have used best practice and where we were actually able to help secure jobs and, above all, where we have succeeded in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
Now it is a question of providing help quickly and therefore I also support the mobilisation of the Fund as quickly as possible, particularly in Steiermark in Austria, where a whole region involved in car manufacture is affected and where there are many suppliers involved which, of course, are particularly important for the infrastructure. I think it is good that this EUR 5.7 million is being made available. However, in this regard I would like to ask that, for all cases that we take a positive decision on here today, an analysis be carried out and that the money does not merely flow out, but that proof is also provided that it is resulting in restoration or that new enterprises are being set up and that active economic activity will, in future, enable this region to regain the vigour that it has had up to now. Thank you, Commissioner.
(DE) Mr President, the Austrian application for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) concerns the former employees of a total of nine automotive suppliers in Steiermark. If we look closer at this case, we can immediately see that it is a classic case for the EGF, namely the provision of remedial assistance. The EGF can provide exactly that, and that is why it was set up, in other words to provide assistance to those directly affected by the negative effects of globalisation and who, through the abrupt loss of their jobs, have to suffer the consequences of the irresponsibility of financial market speculators.
Steiermark, unfortunately, is characterised by its large dependency on demand in the automotive industry. That means that the whole region has been badly affected by the current slump in the market and, in particular, in the demand for cars. Car sales have fallen by 59.4%. In this context, the EUR 5.7 million represents an excellent investment for the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market. In other words, this investment will enable workers to attend local employment foundations, specifically for the automotive sector, while also facilitating the implementation of measures aimed at worker preparation and qualifications.
I would like to point out that the European Parliament has already asked the Commission on one occasion for individual requests for the release of resources to be presented and discussed separately. The requests are again accompanied by a whole series of ambiguities. In the case of the Swedish request, for example, it is not clear what volume of resources will be used and, in the case of the Austrian request, the volume of resources requested for each person losing a job is startling. While in previous projects, sums of several hundred euros were requested per person, Austria is asking for EUR 14 300 for each unemployed person. We remain unconvinced that the proposals correspond to the aims for which the globalisation fund was created and we do not support the release of these resources.
(DE) Madam President, as you can see, this is clearly an Austrian issue, and Steiermark, one of our provinces that has been hard hit, is of great concern to us, with its above-average proportion of the population involved in the automotive industry on the one hand and, of course, a disproportionately high percentage of these products being exported on the other. The global fall in demand has resulted in a total of 744 redundancies, as has already been mentioned, and we are very pleased that 400 of the people affected will receive support through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. That is very much to be welcomed.
In this case - and this needs to be clarified with regard to what the previous speaker said, too - it is not about subsidies for simple restructuring, it is about supporting individual workers by providing assistance with living costs and measures for further training. In this regard, I agree with Mrs Cornelissen, who said that this further training must be particularly geared to the future. We need to have better trained workers for the future and retraining in the areas of technology and renewable energy is certainly a worthwhile step. Steiermark will surely be in favour of that.
The European Union cannot provide such opportunities from a single fund. The changes are too great and too significant. If we think this can be resolved by means of a globalisation fund, then we are not presenting an accurate picture of the situation. We were against the creation of such a fund. However, when it comes to the car industry, we realise that Europe is in a special situation at the moment, with a multitude of different kinds of support at European and national level, and we are at risk not only of the distortion that comes from giving public subsidies to individual players, but also of this distortion being increased if enterprises and industry in different regions are not able to obtain equivalent support. In view of this, we will be voting in favour of this proposal, because we have already come so far in the subsidy process that if support is not provided, then competition would be distorted. However, we would like to emphasise that we cannot carry on like this in the future.
(FR) Madam President, I would like to stress the fact that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund that we have set up is addressed to workers, to improve their employability. Therefore, it is on this point that we must truly take fundamental action. This is the approach that we adopt in examining the cases within the group on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to ensure that workers can be included in the world of work, and stay in employment, because there is no social integration without professional integration.
In the region I come from, I can tell you that during the last year, roughly 2 500 redundancies have been made in the iron and steel industry, approximately 700 in shipbuilding, and an announcement has been made about around 6 000 redundancies to follow in the rail transport sector. This is why I believe that it is important for us to be prepared in 2010 for many similar applications which will come about due to the economic crisis. The existing procedure must be simple so that states and beneficiaries can gain easy access to it. Sweden applied in June, Austria in July and the Netherlands in August, which shows that several months have passed since their applications. This is why I believe that the procedure must be simple.
A number of anomalies have been mentioned and I am going to repeat them very briefly. Firstly, I think the start date needs to be looked at. Secondly, the time span needs to reflect the length of the course, not just the particular two years, as it is at the moment. Thirdly, concerning administration, it is very important that it is not gobbled up, particularly by government agencies. Fourthly - and more importantly - as much help as possible should be given to entrepreneurs. Thirty-five per cent of start-up companies in the EU have been started by people who have been unemployed. If they are helped, they will deliver. Necessity is the mother of invention, and I think it is very important that we give them every assistance we can.
(DE) Madam President, if we assume that most jobs across Europe - not just in my country, Austria - are at risk due to the effects of globalisation, then we must consider, in particular, that younger workers - some of whom have not yet been registered as unemployed because they have just come from a training course or from school - are at risk as a result. We need to take particular care - and this applies to Austria, primarily - to ensure that we use these sorts of measures to support those workers who need to be integrated into the labour market for the first time, and give them the opportunity, including with assistance from the European Union, to enter the European labour market.
Ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the debate has shown clearly that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is functioning and we are able to state that it has now been used several dozen times and it has always brought considerable benefit to the people making use of the fund. As a Commissioner, I have always tried to familiarise myself with results in the field, which is not proper analysis of course but merely direct experience, and I was delighted to see how positively the fund is rated in those areas where it has operated.
The debate has thrown up many questions of a serious nature which demand a response and which call for a clear and realistic opinion. First is the idea that the fund can be used only for big companies. Experience fortunately shows that the fund can be used by anyone, regardless of whether a large or small country or a large or small firm is involved and this was our original intention. The newly adjusted rules clearly provide the possibility for using this fund also in the case of employees of small and medium-sized enterprises which are in areas or fields affected by the crisis. The fund thus operates without discrimination and does not disadvantage anyone.
Concerns over gender inequality were expressed in one speech and I think it was the speech of Mrs Harkin. This inequality, which really does exist at the level of reports, merely proves that the crisis, especially in its first phase, has markedly affected the male-dominated industries. Today also, we are talking about the automobile industry and the construction industry, in other words, two male-dominated industries. In overall figures, therefore, the fund has provided more assistance to men. The crisis has changed the structure of the labour market in a specific way and I noted the statement of President Obama, who declared that at the end of this year, the majority of workers actively engaged on the labour market in the United States would be women. Also in the United States, therefore, the crisis has produced a very striking result in industries dominated by men. As far as the question is concerned, there is no gender inequality at all in the concept or the structure of the fund.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the MEPs from the Committee on Budgets and all of the MEPs involved in this issue because it has emerged clearly from the debate that consideration has been given to all of the contentious matters that are present in every decision of such complexity. In my opinion, it also emerged clearly from the debate and from the proposal of the Commission that all of these cases fall within the scope of the globalisation adjustment fund. I am delighted therefore that your debate has confirmed the view of the Commission and I expect that the vote will go in the same direction, or at least I hope it will.
It is absolutely clear that this Globalisation Adjustment Fund cannot neutralise the consequences of structural change, nor can it accept and overcome the challenges of globalisation, and that, of course, is not its intended purpose. However, it can certainly help the individuals affected, who find themselves in a difficult situation in terms of employment after being made redundant and it can give them the opportunity, through gaining qualifications, to have prospects once more and to find work. That is something that, in spite of the debate about subsidiarity, which of course also plays a part in this connection, we should support and welcome as a supplementary fund to all the measures under the European Social Fund, which we also have.
Thank you very much, Madam President, and I am also very grateful for this clarification, as it is vitally important that we are now going to talk about the microfinance facility. I would also like to welcome Commissioner Špidla to the following debate. Let me begin by saying that when I became rapporteur for this programme, I thought that I would have a very easy job, given the wide-ranging consensus and support on this issue, something which was also in evidence during the debate. This support was wide-ranging in many respects. On the one hand, as a crisis management facility, it will also help precisely those who are in the most desperate situation, who have lost their job and who cannot access credit or assistance either due to the financial crisis.
On the other hand, this is typically a facility which does not provide people with fish, but teaches them how to fish. It triggers precisely the type of creativity which we need most from the point of view of ensuring a positive outcome to the crisis. The third aspect which received, and still receives, wide-ranging support is the fact that the European Union's resources are growing, which I think is the finance ministers' dream. Some of the resources are being contributed by the European Investment Bank, while others are coming from other commercial banks as the European Union will be primarily covering the risk, thereby making it easier for the other participants to assume the risk.
As I have mentioned, there is wide support for the programme's content. I think that, thanks to these aspects, the issue which provoked debate during the discussions with the Council and Commission was to do with which resources the European Union will use to finance this particular primary risk that has been assumed. The second point of contention was the extent of the resources which could help launch the facility and can be expected to actually attract other significant resources. The Council and Commission originally proposed that EUR 100 million should come from the Progress programme, which is primarily used to draw up policies for combating social exclusion and supporting equal opportunities.
We, for our part, said right from the start that the Progress programme cannot be jeopardised in any way since, during the current crisis, it is needed even more than before. It is also not acceptable for us to tinker with the Progress programme to such an extent that could really jeopardise it. Parliament was extremely willing to compromise during the debate. We also held three informal trialogues, one of which went on until the early hours, where we proposed that we could tinker with the Progress programme in any way that would not jeopardise its function. We suggested that, considering the original proposal, we could envisage launching the programme even with EUR 100 million rather than EUR 150 million.
Parliament's 2010 draft budget found resources of EUR 25 million, which will enable it to launch the programme at the very start of 2010, and it was able to find these resources without touching the Progress programme in 2010. We also requested this item be removed from today's agenda because we failed to reach agreement on it. Another matter we felt was an issue was that the Presidency arrived during the trialogue on all three occasions without any mandate, making it very difficult for it to consider our proposals properly.
I believe it is important for Parliament to vote as soon as possible on this matter, this very week even, so that this project can therefore be launched at the start of 2010 with a fund of EUR 100 million, because this conveys the message that this is a crisis management facility where speed is a particularly important consideration. I sincerely hope that Commissioner Špidla can help us get the Commission to withdraw its original proposal on diverting the EUR 100 million from the Progress programme so that this programme can be launched as soon as possible.
I would like to congratulate the Committee on Employment for the outstanding work they have carried out in this area and, in particular, to applaud the contribution made by Mrs Göncz to this initiative. I am aware of the efforts that were made in the negotiations between Parliament and the Council aimed at achieving agreement at the first reading. In view of the fact that both bodies support the micro-financing instrument, it was possible to make considerable progress over the essential wording of the proposal. This progress is reflected to a considerable extent in the amendments proposed today. Of course, the most difficult question is the budget. Although both bodies will probably approve an overall budget of EUR 100 million for this instrument, identifying the sources of the finance continues to be the main obstacle.
As you know, the micro-financing proposal forms part of a package which includes a proposal to transfer EUR 100 million from the Progress programme. You have decided not to vote on this second proposal this week. The transfer of funds from the Progress programme is support by the Council and, for many of the Member States, it constitutes a fundamental element of the whole package. Without an agreement over the source of finance in this area, we will not achieve our objective of implementing the new instrument rapidly. Today, however, we are debating the wording of the decision through which the instrument is to be set up.
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). - (SV) Madam President, if we are to reduce unemployment, then both the EU and the Member States must shoulder greater responsibility. The proposal for microfinancing is an initiative that Parliament has been pushing for. It is about giving the unemployed a new start and opening the door to enterprise for some of the most vulnerable groups in the EU, including young people. The proposal is intended to facilitate small-scale investments and provide microenterprises with the opportunity to grow.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we could sense during the previous debates as well that the economic crisis and how to emerge from it are a preoccupation for every one of us and are being given ample attention. As the coordinator from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would simply like to confirm that we support in every single dossier tabled before us one of the most important items for us, namely, the protection of jobs and the creation of new jobs.
Let me remind you that the PPE Group has been supporting the issue of micro-credit for a long time. In fact, it was my former colleague, Zsolt Becsey, who first tabled this topic before the House in his own-initiative report in 2009. This was based on earlier and current experiences in Hungary with this facility, which was called the Széchenyi card, and had the same purpose as in the current case: providing micro-enterprises with small, short-term credits. Let us think of butchers, bakers, greengrocers or perhaps even chemists. They are also being affected by the crisis. They employ a huge number of people. In some countries, this sector even accounts for more than 90% of employees. This is the case, for example, in Hungary for more than 90% of firms and enterprises. They do not need a large amount of money and they do not want to pay a great deal of interest either. In certain cases, they need temporary working credit and temporary assistance.
The Commission's proposal addresses this very problem and, as the rapporteur said, this proposal really has wide-ranging support and consensus. Therefore, I think that it is important for us to agree on the issue of funding as soon as possible as well. We also support the 35 proposals jointly submitted by the PPE Group, along with the Socialists, Liberals and Conservatives, because we feel that this provides the guarantee that we can approve this facility at first reading and launch it as soon as possible.
Madam President, I am rather surprised. We are going to adopt an instrument that creates an innovative tool, a vital tool, to allow those most vulnerable to this crisis to face it and to come up with their own jobs in the future. This is an instrument to be adopted using the codecision procedure, but the Council is not here. This must be because the Council has nothing to say to us on this issue and does not consider itself bound by the European Parliament's position. In any case, that is the impression that we have had at times throughout the negotiations.
The European Parliament is going to assume its responsibilities. Thanks to the cooperation and constructive understanding between all the groups, it is going to adopt the microfinance instrument, which is consistent with its actions over many years, as Mr Őry reminded us. However, I would also like to point to the pilot projects that we initiated. We know that in this crisis situation, the most vulnerable people - those who do not have access to the large banks to release loans to fund their initiatives - are able, through this tool, to launch their own strategies and, in a way, to create their own jobs.
It is this sleight of hand that this Parliament does not accept, and that is why we have not concluded the negotiations. That is why, taking a responsible attitude, we say that we are prepared to examine our proposal with the Spanish Presidency at the very beginning of January: EUR 40 million taken from the budgetary margins, EUR 60 million taken from the Progress programme, with EUR 20 million redeployed, enabling the burden to be distributed fairly. We will then assume our responsibilities as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to look at how such a programme is implemented in each of the Member States, to bring about a synergy between the various experiments to be conducted in the Member States - we are sure of this - when the package as a whole is adopted in January.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the proposed microfinance facility. Earlier, we spoke about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and how it can assist redundant workers in certain sectors. The microfinance facility is another piece in the jigsaw where the EU, in this case, is trying to ensure access to micro-credit for those who would not be able to access that credit from what we might define as the normal or usual financial institutions. This would enable them to set up their own business and promote entrepreneurship.
In my opinion, the Swedish Presidency did not seem to have the facility to have any meaningful negotiations on the matter. I do not know about you but, as I said, I was very disappointed that a figure of at most EUR 40 million over three years for 27 Member States was all that divided us. Obviously, many finance ministers did not support real negotiation. I could not help but think that many of those same ministers allocated billions to support banks, but were unable to support other financial institutions that would provide micro-credit to those who have lost their jobs and who would have difficulty in accessing credit from the same banks that have been saved.
However, EUR 76 billion is available for the European Social Fund, and with cofinancing that becomes EUR 118 billion! Even a tenth of that would still be EUR 11 billion that the Member States could use. However, they do not use it for micro-credits. For that reason, the Commission created a test phase for micro-credits with an instrument called JASMINE - also financed from European structural funds, and because this was so successful, a new instrument is intended to follow in its wake. However, this will no longer come from the structural funds, where we have billions available to us, but from the smallest of all of the European Union's programmes, the poverty programme Progress, for which a total of only EUR 743 million is available over seven years. It is intended for NGOs which are establishing networks in the Member States in order to provide a pressure group for the poorest of the poor. The European Roma Information Office alone gets 50% of its funding from Progress. It establishes national and regional information and advisory offices and gives the Roma minority a voice, particularly in the Eastern European States.
If this House follows the Council and names this instrument Progress, as proposed in the compromises put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, then the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will not give its approval to this instrument. We cannot allow such conjuring tricks - on one side, taking away money from the poor and, on the other, paying out ...
Ladies and gentlemen, in a time of continuing financial and economic crisis it is necessary to support not only banks and big companies but also small firms and self-employed people. We all know that it is these small firms, including family-owned firms, which create and sustain large numbers of jobs. We support the creation of the new financial instrument of the micro-finance programme for employment and social inclusion which, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank, will improve the availability of loans precisely for self-employed people and small start-ups and family firms.
We agree to the release of resources amounting to EUR 100 million for securing these small loans for a fixed period. We regard this programme as a good and effective instrument for an active policy on employment and as a good way of spending so-called European money, in other words, our money. We fully endorse the proposal to release the necessary resources for this financial instrument from the resources originally intended for the Progress programme. We do not agree to funding for the micro-financing instrument being obtained from reserves or from other budget chapters. The resources of the Progress programme, which amount to EUR 700 million if I am correctly informed, are used for building up study and analysis networks. None of the resources of the Progress programme have been earmarked for directly supporting people who are seeking work or creating jobs. I do not doubt that it is necessary to build up networks and produce analyses and studies. In the current period, however, which is not easy for entrepreneurs and employees, I give precedence to using these resources from the EU budget for programmes directly targeted at employers and employees.
I wish like to stress, however, that this programme will require a comprehensive approach. The social benefit, holiday and pension systems in small companies also need to be developed in line with other sectors. Europe is especially lacking in high-risk funding and those individuals, the business angels, who are prepared to invest in a company in its early stages. Entrepreneurship education and connections to work and employment should also be supported at all levels of education, and there should be more young people's workshops and business incubators and more funds available for them.
As I was saying, this is no time for the Council to haggle over what is a tiny amount of money given the scale of the jobs crisis, the size of the overall budget and certainly in the context of the support that Member States, and indeed the European Central Bank, have given to the banking sector - a banking sector, incidentally, which will not lend to the people that we are seeking to facilitate. I have every confidence that if there is goodwill on the part of the Council, we can reach agreement based on the pragmatic approach of our rapporteur. I sincerely hope they will do so quickly.
In addition, the marginalised shipbuilding industry, which has been efficiently eliminated in Europe by the dumping policy of states in the Far East, has also not gained the support of the European Commission. In my country, Poland, alone, the actions of the European Commission have led to the collapse of the shipbuilding industry and, as a result, many thousands of people have lost their jobs directly, while it is estimated that indirect job losses have been suffered by nearly 80 000 people. However, this sector will not disappear from the world economy. Following the pattern of recent years, it will move to countries in the Far East, at the expense of the labour market in Europe. The lack of a strategy to return ships to national colours is extremely dangerous. As a result of this policy, Europe is irretrievably losing huge incomes, which will flow instead to tax havens.
Another extremely important element of European Commission policy is fishing which, not uncommonly, is the only sector that stimulates non-industrialised areas of the European Union. The Commission is concentrating mainly on reducing the size of fleets while, at the same time, failing to curb mass imports to the European market from the Far East, such as of the highly damaging panga. At a time of crisis, European Commission policy must create the basis for development of the economy, and not hastily treat the effects of erroneous strategy.
The microfinance facility is precisely an instrument targeted at people, the aim of which is to provide a response to all those individuals who, excluded from the bank credit market and having difficulty entering the labour market, intend to start a project, an economic activity, which, nonetheless, can generate individual income and thus contribute to overall growth. In particular, if we want the micro-credit instrument to be effective and to yield lasting results, the Member States must prepare themselves sufficiently, including by establishing links at local administrative level, which is in more direct contact with situations of social crisis, and by taking an active role in making this new facility easily accessible.
It is important to stress that the long-term effectiveness of activities financed by micro-credit instruments and the possibility of fully achieving social integration largely depend on simultaneous guidance, mentoring and training programmes, which must accompany microfinance. At the same time, given the objectives to be achieved with the micro-credit instrument, it is necessary to emphasise one crucial action, namely actively promoting equal opportunities for men and women in access to microfinance programmes. In fact, it is women who are particularly discriminated against and disadvantaged, in terms of access to both the labour market and the conventional credit market.
(ET) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has made a proposal to create a new means of financing - micro-credit financing. The initiative is a good and important one, but the fact that it has been suggested that the resources needed for this should be taken from the already running Progress programme is not acceptable. I would like to remind the Council and the Commission that the people did not elect us in this chamber in order to be a rubber stamp. At the end of 2006, when we adopted the Progress programme here in this chamber, the Member States set their respective aims and began work. The results from the programme were well executed, and there is no reason to think that the programme will not therefore continue running until it ends in 2013.
The programme was and is aimed at all those groups of people finding themselves in an unfavourable position, and there has been help available for them from this programme. Today the economic crisis is growing into a social crisis. Unemployment is increasing month after month, and today the Progress measures remain necessary. At the same time, however, the Commission is going forward with its desire to reduce funding for the measures, which are still being implemented. Such an approach is not responsible, and it is unacceptable. I am sure that we in this chamber cannot approve micro-credit financing until it is clear where the money for these measures will come from - until it is clear that the funds will be found somewhere other than from plans targeted at all those people who are suffering.
(LV) Madam President, the economies of the EU States are still experiencing the effects of the global economic crisis, but the crisis is having the hardest impact on young entrepreneurs and managers of small enterprises, whose entrepreneurial ideas are, at the moment, not receiving support from lenders. Economic growth takes place when new jobs are created. New jobs are created when businesses have access to finance in order to make their ideas into a reality. Unfortunately, in the current crisis situation, the banks do not want to lend money to enterprises because they are frightened of risk. Private capital has also dried up. In these circumstances, it is usually micro-enterprises and young entrepreneurs that suffer the most. They have ideas for development, but no finance, and it is clear that if these enterprises cannot develop, then new jobs will not be created; the creation of jobs is, however, a prerequisite for emerging from the economic crisis.
One solution to this problem is the European microfinance instrument, which plans to allocate EUR 100 million to the development of micro-enterprises and new enterprises, reallocating resources from existing sources of money. In contrast to the large stimulus packages which, over the last year, have been set up predominantly to rescue the financial system as such, this programme is aimed directly at entrepreneurs, not banks. That means that this money will help in the most direct way to create new jobs and will stimulate the real economy. I call upon my fellow Members not to hesitate in taking the decision to establish this microfinance programme. The countries of the European Union are experiencing the crisis now; Europe needs new jobs now; support for new entrepreneurship initiatives is needed right away.
However, in order for the idea of microfinance to work in practice, it needs to operate properly and it needs to operate soon, meaning that on Thursday, when we vote on the 2010 budget, we need to say 'yes' to the first EUR 25 million which will come out of the budget. However, that is not enough. There is another EUR 75 million which I think needs to be found from the budget because, if we take the money from the Progress programme, then it is very simply as if we were taking from the less poor and vulnerable in order to give it to the more poor and vulnerable.
Solidarity, which is one of the European Union's fundamental principles, dictates that they should receive special attention. There is now a great deal of interest in this instrument, especially in Bulgaria, and I assume that this is the case in other countries too. I have kept myself informed on this issue, right from the very start of the debates, through the media, many representatives of which are following its development. It is in the European institutions' interest to demonstrate to the EU's citizens that our immediate task is to look after those affected by the crisis and the poorest members of society.
However, we are, of course, seeing a rise in the unemployment figures and we have to assume that they will rise still further over the next year. I therefore welcome this new financing instrument for people who want to go self-employed. It is, of course, common knowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises create jobs. For many years, we have been discussing financial support for these enterprises. However, every year, we discover that the funds have not gone where they were supposed to go.
I was able to follow the end of a pilot project last week, but as a result, there was not time to put the experiences gained from it in this report. I would therefore like to mention it here. The pilot project used participants who are self-employed or who want to go self-employed, and they were supported for a year along the path to self-employment. It was so successful that I would like to call for it to be included in this project, in other words, that the project not only provide finance for people who are going self-employed, but also for those who support these people. That is necessary because the banks, which will not, of course, give them credit, perceive a certain amount of risk in this regard. I think we can neutralise this risk with this financing.
(LT) I would like to underline that currently, one of the most important tasks for the European Union is to curb the mass unemployment caused by prolonged inactivity and the social crisis. It is unfortunate that it was not possible to reach agreement on a microfinance source of funding during the trialogue. During this difficult social and economic period, the Commission's proposal to reallocate EUR 100 million from the Progress budget would be an unsatisfactory solution, as it would not reduce the social isolation of the most vulnerable groups. I am convinced that the microfinance facility will be more effective and will achieve its goal if it is coordinated by taking national, regional and local programmes into account and receives sufficient funding.
It is also important to take into consideration the fact that European social well-being is directly linked to employment and opportunities provided to find employment. Therefore, I suggest that the Commission consider not only those people at risk of losing their jobs, but also those who are finding it difficult to enter or return to the labour market. Even before the onset of the economic recession, many educated and hard-working citizens had no real opportunities to find employment and therefore, a large number of them emigrated beyond the European Union. As for socially disadvantaged people, I urge the Commission and the Council to bear in mind that apart from young people, there are other socially disadvantaged groups, including women, the disabled and the elderly, who need additional guarantees of employment. Thus, there is no other way but to find additional funds for microfinance facilities.
(DE) Madam President, we have now listened to three or four speakers from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who have said that they do not want to take any money from Progress. However, the amendments state that the instrument is to be called Progress, and Mrs Berès has also said that EUR 60 million will come from Progress. That is two thirds! I would be interested to know what the Socialists' position actually is. Should the instrument be financed from Progress - yes or no?
To illustrate that: I became aware at the weekend of a situation where a company, which had a significant order delayed for three months, went to its bank - the bank it had been dealing with for 15 years - for bridging finance. It was refused. The company director was told that if he took out a mortgage on his own dwelling house, then they would allow him. He did this, and a week later he got a letter withdrawing the overdraft facility on the grounds that they were now in a high-risk situation. The result was that the company closed down and 10 more people were made redundant.
(PL) Madam President, hundreds of thousands of Europeans have felt the effects of the economic crisis in a way which has hit them hardest, for they have lost their jobs. In every country of the European Union, the rate of unemployment has risen, and this is the feature of the crisis which most disturbs our citizens. Essential help is reaching financial institutions. Unfortunately, help is not reaching people at risk of losing their job in time, and it is they who will feel the effects of the present crisis the longest.
The path to self-employment often goes in stages. Initial small investments are easier to cope with than to pile up large mountains of debt. A more manageable risk for starting out in self-employment is something that women, in particular, seek and they often ask for start-up capital in order to secure the start of the business and then, when the business is going well, to expand. Women want to grow with their businesses. Therefore, citizens need to be offered credit amounts that are as small as possible. By that I mean amounts significantly lower than EUR 25 000, which is the amount generally provided for micro-credits.
I believe that it is pointless to keep reiterating that this is what solves or attempts to solve the problems of the most needy citizens, which makes them more confident and more hopeful with regard to entrepreneurship and with regard to the future, so I believe that here we are not thinking of the damage caused by this perfect storm of crises and we are hearing much talk of the exit strategy, of how to get out of this crisis. We will only get out of it if we solve the problem of employment, which is our tragedy, so we should seek to ensure that things move as quickly as possible and ensure that firm guarantees are in place regarding the resources for this facility since we should mobilise much larger resources than those we have heard discussed this evening and certainly should not divert money from one instrument to another, since all three need this money.
This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses. In this time of financial crisis, the most vulnerable people, especially the unemployed and young people, have been the worst affected. In fact, over 3.5 million job losses have been recorded this year in the European Union. The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true. We should not forget that over a third of micro-enterprises are created by unemployed people.
Madam President, I would like to welcome the real added value of micro-credits, which will go hand in hand with new support measures, such as training and mentoring, which will enable the youngest people and the unemployed to obtain guarantees and assistance for their investment plans. I hope that this new instrument to promote employment will be adopted as soon as possible and that an agreement will be reached between Parliament and the Council on making this tool, which is vital for our fellow citizens, and particularly so during this crisis period, a permanent one.
It is clear that, given the currently reduced level of bank lending and given the difficulties that now exist in accessing credit, if the weakest sectors of our society, the unemployed and disadvantaged groups, want to undertake an action, an entrepreneurial activity, all this must be supported robustly, because it is one of the instruments that can help us combat what is the natural epilogue to the financial crisis, namely an endless employment crisis. Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the signs are still negative with regard to employment.
(PL) Madam President, the Progress programme is an important initiative intended to help Member States effectively implement objectives in the areas of employment and social affairs. Last week, I had a meeting with the members of the programme committee concerning implementation of the Progress programme. My conclusions are as follows. Firstly, the advertising campaign, which should introduce potential beneficiaries of the programme to the scope of its operation, is not being conducted in a sufficiently visible way. Secondly, most of the information about tenders and competitions is available in only three languages: English, German and French. This constitutes a functional barrier for people who do not speak any of these languages. I think a review of the principles of the promotional campaign is called for. We should, as quickly as possible, increase recognition of the Progress programme and disseminate knowledge about it throughout the entire Union.
I think that special attention must be focused on young people who, unfortunately, going by the recent European statistics, are facing ever-longer periods of unemployment or are hired on a temporary basis. In addition, an annual report on the use of the budget allocated will enable a serious analysis to be carried out in the near future and, if necessary, a top-up to be provided for this budget. If we transfer sums from one programme to another, we run the risk of undermining both.
We need both instruments, as not everyone is destined to be an entrepreneur. Neither should it be the goal of our employment policy to make new self-employed entrepreneurs out of former employees and the non-self-employed workforce purely for business reasons. For such people, the term 'putative self-employed' would be more appropriate. The Member States must also take appropriate precautionary steps in this regard. However, for all of those who want to accept the challenge of self-employment, the resources must be made available to allow them to start or expand their business. Along with this, however, it must be ensured - and this is the duty of the European Parliament and the Member States - that normal social security continues to be provided. We need new money for new ideas.
(LT) I believe that today, MEPs are completely unanimous in their opinion that this microfinance support facility is now very necessary. Living and working conditions have changed fundamentally and the scourge of unemployment that has affected almost every state is forcing us to put forward certain proposals that certain support facilities should be amended. Until now, most financial support was earmarked for large companies and organisations and on many occasions, it has been underscored that until now, ordinary European Union citizens have had little or no hope of financial support. I believe that the Commission's future solution to seek agreement together with the European Parliament is absolutely essential. 100 million is the very beginning. It is a first attempt, but I am convinced that this attempt may be successful.
The debate saw frequent mention and frequent criticism of the Commission over the issue of the Progress programme and its use within the framework of this new instrument. I have to say that the Commission was not faced with a simple issue because it had to move within the framework of the existing budget or within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement. It was only able to use money which was available. When weighing up our decision concerning the use of Progress programme resources, we very carefully considered the consequences and came to the conclusion that although it was not an ideal solution, it was probably one of the possible solutions.
It was repeatedly asserted in the debate that this involved some sleight of hand or shifting of money from one pot to another. That is not the case, since all of the analyses show clearly that resources used within the framework of the micro-credit principle are subject to an estimated five-fold multiplier effect. In the other programme, these resources would achieve an index of 1 while in the micro-credit programme, they can theoretically achieve an index of up to 5. From this perspective, it is not a matter simply of transferring from one pot to another but of a new use for the resources. I would like to reiterate that it was no easy decision, and I do not even think that it was the only decision and, in the debate over a compromise, a decent basis will surely be found, or at least I hope so.
As I have already said, the idea is to make use of the human capital that is in people who would normally not be able to make use of their capital in this entrepreneurial way. However, it is also very important to make use of time. In my opinion, holding an unduly long debate would be against the very sense of this instrument which is particularly needed in a time of crisis. I also believe that it will be needed in times when there is no crisis and that it will become a permanent component of European labour market and economic policy.
Thank you for the supportive remarks and comments. Allow me to share the view of those who expressed their disappointment due to the Commission's lack of willingness to compromise. I must also say to the Commissioner that if we reallocate what are exclusively Progress resources, this conveys the message that, when it comes to resources for social inclusion, we can only envisage support for the most vulnerable if we take the resources from places serving the same purpose. We are unable to find any other kind of resources. I think that this is unacceptable.
The codecision procedure also means that everyone, each party, must take steps. Parliament came up with a number of suggestions and proposals on this matter, whereas there was no such proposal forthcoming from the Council and Commission which would have helped reach agreement. I must say to Elisabeth Schroeder that the fact that we are defending the Progress programme here conveys our conviction - which is a shared conviction that we are still willing to come to a compromise on this - that this programme must be implemented as soon as possible.
The assistance provided will only be effective if the facility can be launched at the start of 2010. If Parliament actually votes on this matter this week, then it will have done, for its part, what it can to ensure that this programme is launched at the start of 2010. As Parliament will presumably vote for the EUR 25 million from its own resources for next year, and if Parliament votes for the entire amount, this will be sufficient for the Commission to sign the agreements which can facilitate the programme's launch.
The economic crisis has become an acutely felt social crisis for which we have not yet found a solution. Unfortunately, one of the indicators which could help launch a recovery, the level of lending, has reached a record low in the euro area since 1991 and is experiencing an unprecedented collapse in the new Member States, as is the case for Romania. This is one of the elements which cast doubt on the prospects for beating the recession. Against this background, I appreciate the welcome proposal from the European Commission on setting up the microfinance facility.
Since autumn last year, more than 5 million European citizens have lost their jobs, giving a total of 22.5 million unemployed in Europe. In this context, we cannot ignore the serious level of unemployment among young people. It is deeply concerning that one young person in five in Europe does not have a job, which has repercussions at an economic and social level, as well as from a demographic and crime perspective. In some countries, the percentage of young people out of work is even higher in proportion to the national unemployment rate as well. For instance, one young Latvian in three is unemployed, while approximately 43% of Spanish citizens under the age of 25 are affected by this problem. I think that more attention needs to be focused on young people. In this respect, the initiative put forward by the European Commission on microfinance programmes which are entered in a separate budget line will help encourage and motivate young people to enter the labour market, thereby reducing the unemployment rate which has risen among this group.
The current efforts being made at both EU and national level must be stepped up in order to boost the offer of micro-credits. The European Microfinance Facility must provide useful assistance to the unemployed and vulnerable people who would like to set up or run micro-enterprises. I believe that the European Microfinance Facility must have a separate credit line as the beneficiaries of this scheme are different to those for the Progress programme. Progress programme funds must not, under any circumstances, be reduced during this crisis period as they are targeted at the most vulnerable groups. I also believe that the European Microfinance Facility should have a sufficiently large budget to make it really effective in achieving its objectives in terms of employment and social inclusion. Member States and the EU as a whole must continue to implement the Progress programme effectively at a time of global economic crisis
The debate this evening has been triggered by media reports in one particular Member State - Germany. They originate from the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment and from the Technical Supervisory Association (Technischer Überwachungsverein). Neither institution has approached the Commission directly. The German Government has not, as yet, come to the Commission with regard to this matter either. Thus, we do not know any more than what was stated by these two institutions in their press releases and what could be read in the German media. Nevertheless, it is a subject that needs to be taken so seriously that, even if all we have to go on is reports in the press, we still need to address the matter.
The analysis in the reports we have before us indicates that we need to deal with four different issues. The first is a question that is very easy to answer. According to the statement by the German Technical Supervisory Association, a considerable proportion of the toys on the German market that were tested did not comply with the European Union's current legal provisions. In this case, ladies and gentlemen, the rules are perfectly clear. If a Member State makes such a discovery, it is obliged to inform all the other Member States and the European Commission of this immediately and put the necessary measures in place. They can go as far as taking these products off the market immediately, and indeed this means throughout Europe, and also imposing an import ban if these products are manufactured outside the European Union. I hope that the German authorities will very quickly notify the other Member States and the Commission accordingly via RAPEX. Should import bans be necessary, then I assure you here and now that the Commission will approve such bans directly and without delay. However, as I said, as yet, no such information has been submitted to us by the German authorities.
Market surveillance - and I have to say this very clearly at this point - is the sole responsibility of the Member States. Neither the European Commission, Parliament nor the Council have any market surveillance instruments at their disposal. These are the sole preserve of the Member States. However, they are obliged under law, including under the current Toys Directive, to carry out this market surveillance. When I read news from Germany that it is doubtful that the country's market surveillance is in a position to meet the requirements of the new Toys Directive, then there is only one thing I can say, and that is that the German Government is under obligation to ensure that the German market surveillance authorities can meet these requirements. Thus, I think the answer to this question is fairly clear.
The second question is simple, too. It is an old topic on which Parliament has had intensive debates in connection with the adoption of the Toys Directive and where the crucial vote in this Parliament resulted in a clear and unambiguous majority decision in a roll-call vote. It related to the question of mandatory certification of toys by a third body. This proposal was put forward by Germany. The German Technical Supervisory Association was behind the proposal, which was quite rightly rejected because certification by a third body would not provide any additional safety at all in the case of toys, which are normally not technically complicated, as it would be the prototype that would be certified in this case.
When it comes to toys, however, the problem is not the prototype, but, as we know from experience, the problem is whether the high requirements that we set are actually complied with during the entire manufacturing process by all suppliers and all of those involved in the supply chain. As in all other areas, when it comes to toys, we abide by the principle that the manufacturer must take full responsibility for a product being in compliance with the law in force. Regardless of where in the world they are, we must not release manufacturers from this responsibility.
If there is a problem with reliability in a particular country, we need to talk to this country about improving its production conditions, and that is exactly what the European Commission is doing. I am talking about China. We are in close and intensive contact with China with regard to the question of how we can actually ensure that the production conditions in this country, which is by far the largest toy manufacturer in the world, meet our requirements. Progress has indeed been made here, but there is certainly still more that needs to be done.
The third complex of issues relates to chemical substances and heavy metals in toys. This is an extremely difficult and thorny issue. The political guideline that I gave to my colleagues when work was being carried out on the Toys Directive was to lay down the most stringent rules possible - the most stringent possible! This view was also shared by the Council and by Parliament. As a result, the limit values that we included in the new Toys Directive, which will be introduced in stages from 2011 onwards, represented the state of the art in terms of scientific knowledge at the time the directive was adopted.
However, we were aware that this is an evolving process - science is, of course, always progressing and there are always new research results and new findings - and, together, we deliberately framed the directive in such a way that new scientific findings that there are risks that we had not previously observed and that limit values have been set too high can very quickly be incorporated into the directive in a comitology procedure involving Parliament. According to the current legal situation, adopted by the European Parliament, the involvement of the competent scientific committee is needed for the assessment of the risks posed by products.
There have been indications twice this year that new findings may be available. The first was via a letter sent to me by Germany's Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in the spring of this year. The letter concerned cadmium. I immediately arranged for this issue to be submitted to the scientific committee, not only with regard to cadmium, but with regard to other heavy metals, too. We are expecting the results of their examination during the first half of 2010 - by the end of June at the latest. If their examination does indeed reveal new findings, we will immediately bring forward a proposal to tighten up the directive, which has not yet entered into force, so that it enters into force in 2011 with the more stringent limit values in place.
At this point, let me point out that we are dealing with a problem here that, as politicians, we are not really able to solve. These are technical issues that are extremely complex. I will quite openly admit to you that I do not always understand the extremely complicated scientific analyses that are presented to me. I do not imagine that there are many Members of this Parliament, even if everyone were here this evening, who could claim to understand them. We cannot understand them because we have not received the relevant education. To a certain degree, therefore, we have to trust our experts. This is where the problem lies.
The last point is quite an annoying one. In this regard, I have to say that I really would have expected an institute belonging to the government of a Member State to observe the minimum requirements of good scientific conduct. The claim by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, which has been widely taken up by the German media, that, when it comes to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we have a limit value for tyres that is a hundred times more stringent than the limit value for children's toys is simply scandal mongering. It is pure scandal mongering and the scientists there know that.
The truth is that the rules applying to the manufacture of tyres, in particular, to the oils used in this process, originate from the time before REACH and before the Directive on the safety of toys and that, in this case, one of these substances is taken as a reference value. However, this substance represents a group of around a hundred others. Thus, you need to multiply the reference value by one hundred. You then come to exactly the threshold value that also applies to other products within the European Union.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for the clarity and credibility of your statement with regard to the limit values under discussion here. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - we also provided the rapporteur for the Toys Directive at that time in Marianne Thyssen - I would therefore like to make it clear that we, too, want to achieve and maintain complete protection in respect of all hazardous substances. We know that, in this regard, we have a particular responsibility for the health of our children and therefore our future.
Particularly before Christmas - you mentioned this, Commissioner - it needs to be possible for parents and grandparents to be certain which toys are safe for their children or grandchildren and which toys they can buy for them. Like you, I, too, call on the market surveillance authorities in the Member States, in particular, in Germany, to fulfil their obligations and remove dangerous toys from the market. I believe that we made the right decision at the time not to implement certification by third bodies as a general evaluation criterion for toys.
As regards the limit values, a similar appeal was made a year ago - as you mentioned. At that time, I wrote a letter to you asking you to refer the matter to the Commission's scientific committee, and that is something for which I am very grateful to you. I tried, back then, to obtain more scientific opinions from Germany and I have since received these. I would like to quote from one study by the Chemisches und Veterinäruntersuchungsamt Stuttgart (the Stuttgart Chemical and Veterinary Testing Office): 'Comparisons of the higher migration limit values in the new directive with the fifteen year old values in DIN EN 713 are ultimately difficult to evaluate from a technical point of view.'
With this, I believe I can explain that it is not a cheap way of palming the issue off on to science and saying 'we do not want to examine this any closer because we do not want to understand it', but it is a genuine and difficult dispute among experts and one institute in Germany is clearly putting its point of view across particularly strongly. However, I urge you, Commissioner, to do everything possible to bring together the scientific institutes involved to enable them finally to agree on a scientifically objective opinion.
I have just listened to the Commissioner basically blame the institute for doing its work. I have listened to him heaping blame on scientists. I have listened to him heaping blame on the Member States, who are responsible for supervision. I have listened to all this with a great deal of interest, just as I have listened to him constantly telling us, with a great deal of honesty and solid data, that every previous directive is improved every now and then with new data. That fact alone confirms that the Federal German institute has done its job properly. So we need to bear that in mind.
Sixthly, it is totally unacceptable, should this be the case, that lower standards should apply to imports into the EU than, for example, into the US. However, the threat by the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, to go it alone and prohibit so-called 'toxic toys' herself is, in my view, completely the wrong way to go about it and totally counterproductive when it comes to creating confidence in the European internal market. Merely cultivating national popular opinion not only destroys confidence in the European Institutions; it also damages the German Federal Government, because it approved the Toys Directive.
It cannot be the case that children can take up many times the quantity of carcinogenic substances in just one hour of skin contact than are contained in the smoke from 40 cigarettes. These substances can be avoided. The study shows that this is technically possible. Seventy percent of toys sold are below these thresholds. Therefore, it is possible at any time to require the other toys to meet these limit values, too. It is presumably a question of price, but that cannot be regulated by the market alone when the safety of children is at risk. Political action needs to be taken to adjust and raise the threshold values accordingly.
Of course, Member States are responsible for market surveillance, not Europe, Parliament or the Commission. We have also called on Germany many times to take its duties in the area of market surveillance seriously and to take the relevant action. However, that does not, by any means, mean that we do not need to take action where there is doubt as to whether our threshold values reflect the latest scientific findings, and therefore it is my hope and request that the new Commission will present proposals to Parliament as soon as possible so that we can then adjust the relevant limit values in the comitology procedure.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the safety of children - our smallest and most vulnerable consumers - has always been a priority for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and indeed for everyone in this House, and it was for this very reason that, one year ago, we adopted a new, strict, Directive on the safety of toys. Thanks to the excellent cooperation with the Commissioner and his services, with the Council Presidency and with my fellow MEPs across all the political groups, we were able to complete that mammoth task; and quickly, namely in a single reading. All our institutions were convinced that we had drawn up legislation that was the strictest in the world and was being followed attentively as far a field as China and the United States.
Parliament acted sensibly as far as third-party certification was concerned, and took a particularly strict line concerning the standards on chemical substances such as allergens and heavy metals. With regard to the substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR), we opted for a total ban, with a few exceptions under very strict conditions. This legislation provides for a transitional period, but that goes without saying - it is inherent in the system - and, in any case, this transitional period is shorter than the industry had said it could cope with. Ladies and gentlemen, either we got it completely wrong and failed with regard to this act, or science and technology have evolved to such an extent that the act already needs amending, which can be done very quickly through the comitology procedure, or there is nothing wrong, in which case we cannot play unnecessarily on people's fears and on their justified concern for their children's safety. I have listened to and believed the Commissioner, and I see that the European Commission is doing what it has to do.
(DA) Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, for your introduction. If I have understood you correctly, you wanted to ensure that a study was started into whether there are, in fact, too many toxic substances in children's toys in Germany, as the study indicates. If I have it right, then I would say that your idea is a good one. It is extremely important for us to act quickly. If we have any reason to suspect that our children's safety is at risk, then we must act. Furthermore, we would, of course, appreciate it if the Commission could get back to us here in Parliament very quickly to let us know whether or not there is anything in these claims. However, I would like to point out that, when it comes to softening agents in toys, there are, in fact, a number of researchers who are saying that there is no safe limit. The only safe thing to do is to leave the softening agents out of our children's toys completely. I really think that we should take a stand on this and consider whether we should not have tightened up the rules. I am not sure that the rules are good enough, even those in the new Toys Directive.
However, there is another matter that I would also like to raise in this regard, and that is that, a month and a half ago, we received a Commission study into how the new market surveillance legislation had been implemented in each Member State. It is indeed right that it is the task of the Member States to ensure that market surveillance functions properly. However, this study showed that, despite the fact that we have tightened up the rules, only two Member States chose to put more money into market surveillance. We ought to be able to do better than this. It is precisely to prevent terrible stories of unsafe toys on the market that we need significantly better market surveillance. I therefore also hope that the Commission will ensure that the Member States achieve this.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am, however, disturbed by another piece of information. At the end of November, in the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission decided to recall over a million children's cots from the market. Another million will be recalled from the Canadian market. A cot is an item of everyday use, and children come into contact with cots more often, perhaps, than with toys. In view of the scale of the operation, I would be grateful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter. Can we be sure that the children's cots available on the European market are safe?
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank you most sincerely for the clarity of your words. Essentially, it should be said that, overall, the Toys Directive has brought a considerable improvement in the protection of our children. We all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world. However, many parents and grandparents are now concerned - as you said - because of the studies by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. We now need to ask ourselves whether or not the Institute's statements and opinion are right. In any case, we need to examine the facts of the matter very closely. It is a question of the protection of our children.
At this point, I would like to thank you most sincerely for having stated that you are willing to do that. However, I think that things need to move more quickly. Not until next year, you say, during the first half of the year, will the findings of the scientific committee be available. It must be done quicker than that. It is a question of the protection of our children. I really cannot understand why the Federal Institute left it so long to come out with these statements. I want to make that point here, too.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted at the broad consensus that this debate has shown. Allow me to make a preliminary comment. We are dealing with a scientific institute, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, which I have been aware of for some time as a result of its tendency to make alarmist announcements to the public without informing the Commission or any other European institutions of its findings. You can judge that for yourselves. The only thing that I know about this is that the continued funding of this institute from Germany's Federal budget is under discussion. Perhaps that is one explanation for the institute's intensive public relations activities, while it clearly sets no great store by allowing us to examine its findings in any appropriate way.
Nevertheless - and it seems I have been misunderstood on this point - even if we only read something in the media, we still regard it as an indication of possible new scientific findings and I have already passed this on to the scientific committee. The call for me to do this that has been expressed here is not needed. The moment that I receive an indication that there may be new scientific findings available concerning the safety of toys and the limit values that we have set, this information is sent to the scientific committee.
However, I must reiterate that you cannot expect me, and likewise I cannot expect you, to make a decision in respect of the disagreements among scientists regarding methods. You cannot do that. I cannot do that and neither can you. I can do nothing more than say that the question of methodology in the measurement of possible limit values has been rigorously debated here in Parliament, in the Council and the Commission. Furthermore, the opinion of this German institute is not shared by any other scientific institute in Europe - not one! If you believe that I am obliged to follow the opinion of a single institute and ignore that of all the others, then please tell me so and you can reprimand me for this. I cannot assume this responsibility. Not one of you can do that either. However, I will say it once again: if any new findings come to light, the process will be set in motion.
Mrs Weisgerber, you said that the process should go quicker - unfortunately, it cannot go any quicker. These are very complicated scientific issues. Tests are needed. You are perhaps not aware of this, but extensive animal tests are needed, for example, in order to be able to verify this sort of claim. You cannot force scientists to produce findings within a particular timeframe. I am sorry, but that is not possible. I must therefore simply ask you to be satisfied with me telling you that the scientific committee has told us that it will be able to provide substantiated results by the middle of next year, and it will indeed do so. On the basis of these results, the Commission will immediately prepare new proposals if it should emerge that there are indeed new findings. I hope that makes it clear.
Mrs Rühle, you say that I should have gone to the press sooner. It will surprise you when I say that I did exactly that. Just as I do not think that what I have said here this evening in Parliament will make it into the European media, and particularly not the German media, so my factual and, I thought, calm statement of the facts was not taken up by the German media. However, I issued the necessary statement and explained the facts of the matter. I would be happy to provide you with the text.
The last question from Mrs Hedh is a very important one. With regard to the standards for different areas, you mentioned two examples, one of them being sources of noise. The relevant instructions have been sent to the European standardisation organisations. However, for standards, it is no different than for other scientific work. You cannot expect them to be available in a week or in one, or indeed several, months. It takes time. However, all of the standards that we have talked about are in progress and will be available in good time, and they will also allow us to develop an exact comparability of the products and to strengthen market surveillance.
There is one last point I would like to address. Baby seats, which have been mentioned here and with regard to which there have been some safety problems in the US, are not toys. They do not, therefore, fall within the scope of the Toys Directive, but rather within that of the General Product Safety Directive. We need not hide from the Americans in this regard. The system that we have in Europe with regard to the general safety of products has continued to prove its worth over the last few years. If unsafe products appear on the European market, we can now assume with a degree of certainty that all the other Member States and the Commission will, in fact, be informed about them and that the appropriate steps will also then be taken.
in writing. - I welcome the fact that the new Directive 2009/48/EC on toy safety will come into force in 2011, although it is regrettable that the directive will not be in force for the Christmas 2010 period next year, when the majority of toys made or imported into the EU, are sold. I hope that Member States will see fit to transpose all elements of this important directive before the final deadline for implementation in order to give parents, as consumers, greater peace of mind.
Taking the opportunity of this debate, I would like to draw attention to the need to improve the functioning of the European Union's register of consumer accidents, which anticipates, among other things, collection of information about fatalities and bodily injuries resulting from the use of various products intended for children. The register should be an important element of the mechanism of the system for protecting consumers, including the youngest and most helpless. Unfortunately, according to an expert from the Technical Committee on products for small children and toy safety of the Polish Committee for Standardisation, rapid exchange of information between Member States and the European Commission on products which pose a hazard, and steps taken in particular countries to prevent or restrict their coming onto the market, is still not functioning satisfactorily. I would like to ask that this matter be thoroughly investigated.
However, I must point out that we have to be very careful here when using state financing and taxpayers' money. In my own constituency, I am aware of some microfinance facilities, such as the excellent Croydon Caribbean Credit Union, which helps underprivileged communities come out of poverty. These facilities have been squeezed out by local government and other state microfinanced facilities. It is important, in pursuing increased accessibility to microfinance, that we do not squeeze out the many excellent private providers that are already there.
I voted in favour of the creation of this microfinance facility for employment, since it aims at providing opportunities for the unemployed and encouraging entrepreneurship. This facility, which is aimed at people who want to start or develop a micro-enterprise (less than 10 employees and a turnover of less than EUR 2 million), will open up new horizons for many unemployed people. Given the current state of the economy, it would have been useful if this important programme had been launched sooner, because people have been finding it difficult to access credit for a long time now.
in writing. - One of the most detrimental consequences of the global economic crisis is the lack of credit being supplied by banks, which is preventing individuals as well as large companies from conducting their economic activities. The proposal being made by the European Commission provides for the establishment of a microfinance facility that seeks to aid in alleviating the current hesitation in funding by banks and other financial institutions. It is for this reason that I have decided to support the rapporteur on this issue and vote in favour of the report.
Generally speaking, what we need are policies which call for an increase in the Community budget and which overturn the neoliberal framework of the Stability Pact and low deficits. I also believe that funding within the framework of this mechanism should be purely voluntary and should not in any way force anyone to use the mechanism under the threat that their social security benefits will be cut or reduced. Unfortunately, amendments to this effect tabled by me and my fellow members in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected.
In the current context of economic crisis and rising unemployment it is important to foster the growth of self-employment, as well as the creation and development of micro-enterprises. Micro-credit will help achieve this objective. I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal and Parliament's work on this subject. This is a way to encourage entrepreneurship and raise the levels of employment and social inclusion. This microfinance facility is complementary to other programmes that support employment and inclusion. I therefore think it is important that this facility should not be financed at the expense of existing programmes or jeopardise them.
We regret that a majority in this Parliament has yet again gone back on its word and approved a proposal that takes money out of the Progress programme, which was already clearly underfunded for its areas of action in the social field. Irrespective of any considerations regarding the objectives of the new European microfinance facility, it is unacceptable that it should be financed by reducing the funds available to existing programmes, in this case Progress, a Community programme in the area of employment, social inclusion and equal rights.
Thanks to the Göncz report on micro-credit and the controversy that surrounded the financing of this project, I went to see what this famous Progress programme - which the left is so adamant should not be deprived of a single cent for the financing of micro-enterprises and individual initiatives - is all about. Because, for the moment, what purpose does Progress, defined as the 'Community programme for employment and social solidarity', really serve? That of creating paperwork, and of financing studies and reports. Because, for the moment, Progress's 'target' audience is neither the unemployed nor the excluded, but political decision makers and opinion formers.
Some people are refusing to deduct EUR 100 million for micro-credit from the paltry sum of EUR 700 million allocated over seven years. A little less money for those who profit from the system, a little more money for Europeans, with a constant budget: one cannot argue with that! The time has come to stop observing the poverty and the difficulties of our fellow citizens and to take concrete action instead. I have one reservation, however: micro-credit is necessary only because the 'banksters', who are so quick to pocket State aid, are not doing what they are supposed to be doing: pumping money into the economy.
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Mrs Göncz, because I feel it is crucial, especially in the context of an employment crisis and of a social crisis, to support micro-finance by providing it with a specific budget line. This is a special instrument in the fight against banking exclusion and poverty. Contrary to what the European Commission is asking, we oppose the idea of reallocating appropriations from the Progress programme to the European Microfinance Facility, because that would send out a negative message to economic operators. We must maintain the Progress programme, which targets the most vulnerable groups, and it is the joint responsibility of the Member States and the European Union to implement it effectively in the current circumstances.
I am absolutely delighted that the vast majority of the European Parliament has today approved the report on the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion. The planned micro-credit system can contribute significantly to the creation of social cohesion and new jobs, not to mention greatly help alleviate the harmful effects of the financial and economic crisis. During the global recession, it is particularly important to provide new opportunities for citizens who have been squeezed out of the labour market and the traditional credit market, and pave the way for stable, long-term self-employment. Furthermore, it is vital that a simple financial facility exists for those in disadvantaged regions intending to start up their own business and for the most vulnerable groups, which, in spite of the high risk, low margins and risk of default, helps businesses to start up and thrive. The overwhelming majority of employees in Europe are employed by micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises.
Faced with the insatiable commercial appetites that the European Union's liberal dogmatism has created, we need a policy that protects European workers, the creators of the wealth of which they are being deprived in the name of profit. Again, this is a case of the Europe of big profits and of small, arbitrary handouts. The paltry sums pledged, the lack of clarity concerning their allocation and the individualistic logic behind the vehicle promoted testify to this. This bears no relation to the Europe of the general interest and of social equality that our peoples need.
At a time of crisis, when credit is scarce and access to it difficult, this kind of facility is essential to help provide micro-credit for small enterprises and people who have lost their jobs and want to start up new businesses on their own. It is difficult to achieve such goals without this kind of support facility. Furthermore, in the current crisis situation, banks are not sensitive to the credit needs of start-up enterprises which, in most cases, makes it impossible for them to get off the ground. With the prospect of several million more jobs being lost in the EU, it is important to have incentives that people who are made redundant can access in an attempt to make a new life for themselves, thereby avoiding social crises and reducing Member States' spending on social support measures.
The financial and economic crisis caused primarily by British and American speculators is now leading to growing unemployment in Europe as a result of the economic downturn. It is mainly young people, who were already at serious risk of unemployment, who have been particularly hard hit by the changing situation. Therefore, it is especially important to give them an opportunity to start or restart their careers and to pave the way for some of them to start their own companies. I hope that the new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion - Progress - will give them significant support in this respect.
This new instrument also allows us to respond to the continuing credit crunch. As well as interest rate support, people who set up micro-enterprises will also receive support in the form of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building. I support the committee's initiative to increase the funding for the microfinance facility by 50%, compared with the Commission's proposal, to EUR 150 million. Looking at the huge sums that have been spent on rescuing the banks, it is important to be generous to those people who have been hardest hit by the situation. For all of these reasons, I have voted in favour of this report.
The microfinance facility is supposed to give easier access to financial services to the unemployed and groups of businesspeople who have found themselves in a difficult situation. It is concerned with people from certain social groups who do not have the creditworthiness required by commercial banks but would like to start up in business. Introduction of this type of support facility, which comes from EU funds, has particularly significant meaning in a situation in which lending levels are currently reduced and the value of loans which have been made has fallen.
The situation in the lending sector shows that the financial and economic crisis is changing into an employment and social crisis. The report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs contains significant amendments to the Commission Proposal, including opposition to transfer of the necessary funds from the Progress programme to the European Microfinance Facility. The rapporteur proposes putting the facility under a separate budget line, and also proposes increasing the facility's budget for the next four years by EUR 50 million. In view of these aspects, I endorse the report.
I have voted in favour of the resolution to introduce the microfinance facility, because for me, the top priority is to adopt this resolution quickly. This will give disadvantaged sections of the population the opportunity to take out loans and to help themselves. However, I am calling on the Council not to take the funding from Progress. It is important that this programme retains its funding in full. In particular in this crisis, EU money must not be redeployed at the expense of the weakest members of society.
in writing. - I am delighted that the European Parliament has today approved a scheme for ensuring that additional loans will be made available to small businesses. This decision will allow EUR 100 million to be made available at regional and national level over the next four years. This is a valuable and timely development which will provide many of those people suffering the effects of the global recession with new opportunities. The measures announced today will support those wanting to start new businesses, as well as providing professional training - thereby increasing the range of skills upon which citizens can draw to set up the enterprises which are vital to Europe's economy. More and more, we are seeing greater consideration of small and medium-sized enterprises in European Union policy and legislation. I welcome this new development and, in particular, the European Parliament's contribution to stimulating the development of small businesses in difficult economic times.
Currently, the financial and economic crisis is changing into a social crisis and an employment crisis. The unemployed and people from social groups which are in an unfavourable situation need active support and advice if they want to become independent. The Progress programme is aimed at the most exposed groups, and in relation to this, I think Member States and the European Union are responsible for effective implementation of the programme. The Union should also make every effort to increase the range of directed financial support for new sole traders and the founders of micro-enterprises in the form of monitoring, training - including practical training - and skills development.
Microfinance is an interesting instrument to provide people who are unemployed or in danger of losing their jobs, and also enterprises in the social economy, with financial support in times of crisis. I voted against this report, as it is not certain that this instrument is to be financed with fresh money. It is possible that resources from the existing Progress programme will be used, a programme that was launched in 2007 and comprises actions concerning poverty reduction, anti-discrimination, social inclusion, gender and employment. Taking money from programmes that fight poverty in order to fight poverty is not a good strategy.
The Council, in particular, rejects a separate budget. The Member States clearly lack political courage. To enable this to start at the beginning of 2010, EUR 25 million is being released from the 2010 EU budget. There is no agreement between Parliament and the Council at present on the financing for the following three years (2011-2013). What Europe needs is a sustainable strategy and not a one-off injection such as this initiative. The microfinance instrument has no coherence and no long-term vision. In addition, micro-credits can already be granted under the European Social Fund, and also under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. I say an emphatic 'no', then, to this report.
I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to ensure this money did not come from the 'Progress' programme, which is designed to help vulnerable people, but was created using money from the 2010 budget for the first year. The EUR 100 million fund, available from early 2010, is exactly the kind of help that small businesses need at this time of financial crisis when banks are still unwilling to release credit. This will help businesses across Wales, and I am disappointed that colleagues from UKIP were unable to support this progressive initiative.
Mr President, what Parliament wants is not merely to be informed after the event about proposals by the Commission and the Council; it wants to actually participate in developing and implementing the 2020 strategy. How are you going to ensure this, and what timetable are you working to? The Council President has announced that the intention is to reach conclusions as early as March. Will you take the initiative? Can we expect a specific framework in the near future containing starting points and objectives as a basis for participation by Parliament in this discussion? Can you let us know what timetable you are working to and who is responsible? Are you Mr 2020?
President of the Commission. - As President of the Commission, I will be responsible for that, in coordination with my colleagues in the Commission, because this will be the central task for the next Commission, as was presented in my political guidelines. Regarding the timing, we hope to have a formal communication ready in time for the Spring Council, but I feel it would be better only to have the formal conclusions at the June Council. That will be my proposal to the European Council, so that we can have - and I very much wish for this - full participation and ownership for Parliament of the strategy.
Mr President, Mr Barroso, 2009 is drawing to an end in a difficult situation, with major unemployment and economic and budgetary problems. At the same time, the five-year period of the Barroso Commission is coming to a close. What conclusions do you draw from the first five years about the second five years, providing that the Commission is confirmed in office, in particular, with regard to these economic and social issues? What will you be saying to our citizens and also to your commissioners about the things that should be different in this new period?
Mr President, my question concerns the situation in Greece. This situation is very alarming, of course, with a government deficit of 12.7% and government debt poised to exceed 130%. This is exactly the situation I found in Belgium when, at a young age, I became Minister for the Budget in 1985. The figures were exactly the same - I shall never forget them - 12.7% government deficit. Clearly, then, Greece will have to work hard and implement reforms it has not implemented to date. Yet we, too, can do something, President Barroso. We can enable the costs associated with the government debt of the various Member States to fall by installing, at long last, a European bond market that would cover a large proportion of this government debt. We are currently paying several hundred billion euro too much in interest on our government debt owing to the fact that there is no European bond market and all the bond markets are still segmented, with an enormous shortage of liquidity. My question is whether you will take the initiative in this matter and launch such a European bond market at long last. This would not obviate the need for Greece to make an effort itself, but it could help.
We were also very impressed by the candid presentation made by the Prime Minister of Greece in the last European Council. He is fully aware of the problem and he has shown us his determination to address it. Greece will submit to the Commission in the course of January an updated stability programme, as foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact. I trust that this programme will include concrete measures to strengthen fiscal adjustment in 2010 and to ensure lasting consolidation of public finances. Naturally, the Commission will continue to monitor very closely the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and the implementation of the measures in Greece.
Mr President, to come back to what I was saying, a European bond market could help Greece. It would by no means obviate the need for that country to carry out reforms, but it would help all the other EU Member States too, as it would mean a much lower interest rate being payable on the debt. Let us compare the interest rates payable in Germany and the United States. The Americans pay 0.4% less interest on their treasury bonds than the Germans, even though German public finances are in much better shape. This is proof that we urgently need to take that course. I expect the Commission to do so.
Let us be honest about it. Greece and the countries of the euro area have a specific obligation when it comes to implementing the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is very important for them and, above all, for their own economy, but it is also important for others. I believe that raising this issue at this moment and suggesting that there could be a solution outside Greece's own efforts is not the best way to help our Greek friends to implement, with determination, the measures announced by Prime Minister Papandreou.
I would like to ask you today about the structure of the next Commission. The portfolio responsibilities that you have presented seem to us to have very presidential overtones. In our opinion, you are organising this structure in such a way as to give you personally, as Commission President, a great deal of power. We are surprised that you want to abolish the working groups of the members of the Commission. In our opinion, these groups have produced good results during the last parliamentary term. We are also surprised that the responsibilities in some areas have been fragmented in a way which seems to us incomprehensible. It is a mystery to us how you will handle the division of responsibilities between Mrs Reding and Mrs Malmström. It seems to us that Mrs Malmström will be creating a sort of homeland security office. I definitely have nothing against making the climate into a separate responsibility. However, if you appoint a climate commissioner, you must also show that she has real power and will have access to areas such as energy, industry, transport, the environment and agriculture. We do not believe that this is the case.
There will also be a Commissioner for home affairs, which is basically what happens in most, if not all, Member States in Europe - there is a minister for the interior and a minister for justice. I believe that it is much more efficient so that they can work with their colleagues in the respective Councils. It will also be much better in terms of the amount of work because, as you know, we have just approved the Stockholm Programme. This is a very ambitious programme in which this Parliament has a lot of important competences now, so it is fully justified to have two different Commissioners. It is not because of the role of the President in this case. It has nothing to do with the role of the President of the Commission. It has to do with the need to have some kind of division of labour in such an important area. I would like the Commissioner for fundamental rights to have security concerns in her hands, and I would like the Commissioner for security to do the job whilst respecting fundamental rights and the spirit of liberties in the European Union.
I would like to repeat my previous question. How can the climate commissioner be a powerful force and how can she assert herself, if this, on the basis of the second option, is not reflected in the structures? Secondly, there is another issue in the detail which seems totally unreasonable to us and that is that green genetic engineering, which you, Mr Barroso, are in favour of, now forms part of the health portfolio and is no longer included in the environment or agriculture portfolio. We need you to explain this.
Mr President, I would like to ask for your assessment of the EU-Ukraine Summit which took place almost a fortnight ago. At the same time, I would like to raise two matters. When I was in Kiev, I learned that the European side refused to accept a reference in the final declaration to Ukraine's European identity. I will not hide the fact that this surprises me greatly, because it seems to me that the question of Ukraine's European identity should not be a matter of dispute. Secondly, I learned in Kiev that our European delegation refused to lay wreaths at the monument to the victims of the Ukrainian famine, something which is customary for all diplomats visiting Ukraine, and I must say that these two facts surprise me greatly.
Also linked to the issue of innovative financing, I personally believe that, if we want to meet our obligations regarding the fight against climate change, it cannot be only with the money from our budgets. It is obvious that our budgets are under such pressure that our national budgets alone over the next few years cannot provide the resources for fighting climate change. We have to think of innovative ways of financing. A global financial transaction tax seems to me a very good idea, and we are working on that area in order to put forward proposals at an appropriate time. I hope the new Commission will put forward some proposals in this area.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr Barroso, we have recently heard that there is to be a closure of the Corus steel works on Teesside in northern England. This is due to an EU target reduction of 20% of carbon emissions. Thanks to the carbon credit, Corus can no longer afford to employ over 5 000 steel workers, including suppliers. We also have the spectacle of the British Government admitting that its hands are tied on this issue because of punitive EU competition law.
The real gain to Corus from stopping production on Teesside is the saving it will make in its carbon allowances allocated by the EU under its emissions trading system scheme, which will be worth up to GBP 600 million over the next three years. But surprise, surprise - guess what: the head of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri, is also the head of the Tata Foundation, so, one must ask, cui bono? Because Tata owns Corus.
(FR) Mr President, the European Commission, in response to the referendum in Switzerland on minarets, has gone to the lengths of making a statement that is disturbing and ambiguous, to say the least. It felt it necessary to reaffirm, for the benefit of those Member States that might be tempted to take similar decisions, the need to 'respect fundamental rights such as freedom of religion'. This thinly veiled threat requires some explaining on your part, when opinion polls show that the vast majority of Europeans would have voted in such a referendum had it been an option in their respective countries.
(MT) I had intended to address a question to the President of the Commission concerning the Commission. However, an intervention was made today by the Socialist Party concerning the hearing we have with the Commissioners. I hope that the Socialist Party will not start playing around with the portfolios assigned to the nominated Commissioners. We do not have the competence to change the Commissioners' portfolios, since this falls under the exclusive competence of the President of the Commission. The selected individuals, from our Party, the Liberals and the Socialist Party, are all very valid persons, and we should not have the competence to start debating as from now, prior to the hearing, whether we can change the portfolios of the Commissioners. I am aware that this was not the subject, but following the Socialist Party's intervention, I felt that I had to make this intervention.
When the Lisbon Strategy was being revised, we put forward a proposal based on the Wim Kok report, and it was refused by Member States. After this crisis, I think there is now much more awareness of the need to have real coordination in the response to the crisis. I am going to fight for that but, of course, we need the support of the Member States to achieve this. We need them, because some of those policies are made at national level and some are at Community level.
In this connection, I read in the memo with which you have presented us that you are talking about internationalising SMEs, the main creators of jobs in the EU. Do you not think, Mr Barroso, that the urgent requirement today is to stabilise the situation, to reassure people? Moreover, can you guarantee today that the Commission will oppose any regulatory hysteria and will apply, on a daily basis and in all its policies, the principle, the strategy, 'Think small first'?
Thank you, Mrs Ries. This was one of the priorities of my Commission, but it is also a priority for the current Commission and will certainly be a priority for the next Commission too. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the ones that create jobs. We created the Small Business Act on the basis of the very principle - 'Think small first' - that you are talking about, and we are embarking on a programme to reduce administrative burdens, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why we have placed the completion of the internal market at the heart of our priorities, as there is potential and also an international dimension to exploit, because the truth is that our small and medium-sized enterprises are still coming up against a number of obstacles when trying to work with other markets. I therefore believe that this is one of the priorities of the new strategy, of the 2020 strategy. It is precisely a strategy that is linked more closely to the international dimension, because, today, the effects of globalisation are being felt, and it is only by adopting an aggressive, proactive stance that we can win this battle of competitiveness.
President Barroso, I welcome your vision for 2020. You show that even in the dark days of recession, one can dream of Utopia. I welcome your comments on European research areas. I represent Cambridge, which is home to the leading research cluster that has already seen great successes in high-tech, green-tech and bio-tech. If we are to turn your dreams into anything like reality, then we could do with listening to, and learning from, the Cambridge experience. Research needs funding; innovative businesses need funding; world class-innovation needs world-class funding.
President of the Commission. - Congratulations to Cambridge. I think Cambridge is one of the greatest universities in Europe and in the world. It is precisely because we do not have so many Cambridges in Europe that we have been working to have a real European research area, because Cambridge and other very important universities in Europe are quite international. They are able to attract very important funding, but in other countries, especially small countries and some of the poorest countries, they do not have those kinds of resources. That is why we not only need private funding like the ones you mentioned, and I certainly welcome all the work of foundations such as the ones you mentioned, but we also need public funding from the states and from the European Union budget. That will be one of the points I intend to put into the next European Union budget.
(NL) Mr President. President Barroso, I should like to ask you a question regarding the future of the automobile sector which, indeed, will remain one of the most important industrial sectors even after 2020. Some of our crown jewels are about to be sold off to China, which is an unwelcome development. In my opinion, it is by no means too late to avert this, but to do so we - you, Mr President, and the new European Commission - must move up a gear as a matter of urgency. We must mobilise more resources for research and development, with greater focus on the automobile sector, and we must also, of course, mobilise more financial resources from the European Investment Bank. As I see it, this is the only way to ensure that our current dependence on oil is not replaced with a future dependence on Chinese electric batteries, for example. Hence my question: are you and the European Commission prepared to assume a coordinating role in the short term, including with regard to the Opel dossier, so that we can join together resolutely to focus on the new, environmentally friendly technologies in the automobile sector?
(PL) Commissioner, implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is not going very well. How do you intend to change the document on the Europe 2020 Strategy in order to achieve its objectives? Do you foresee preparation of something in the way of a programme for realisation of the strategy, a separate document for the Commission's five-year term of office, which would set out the actions to be implemented? I think it would be a good idea. We could monitor realisation of the strategy and, at the same time, appraise the Commission on what has been implemented.
President of the Commission. - The deadline is the deadline for the consultation based on this document, but there will also be other opportunities to consult. In fact, there have been consultations on the future of the Lisbon strategy at least since 2008. The Committee of the Regions has prepared a very interesting report, as has the Economic and Social Committee, and I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am prepared, if the European Parliament so wishes, to hold a debate on this matter - not just this question hour with one-minute replies, but a special debate on this matter alone - whenever you want, because I really believe it is extremely important.
(DE) Following up on the question which has already been asked, I would like to return to the 2020 climate strategy. Mr President, is it right that the provisional emissions trading system gives the largest steel company in Europe 90 million tonnes of CO2, despite the fact that it had 68 million last year and will have 43 million this year? Can it be that the largest steel company in Europe will have earned GBP 1 billion by 2012 from emissions, having been allocated too large an amount as a result of its lobbying activities with, among others, the Commission?
However, on an emissions per capita basis, we are still far above those economies and let us be fair about it: we also have some historical responsibility. The Americans produce more greenhouse gas emissions per capita than we do, but we produce much more than China and much more than India, for instance, if you are referring to the Indian case. This is indeed a problem that we have to address in a spirit of global fairness. If we want to solve the problem and if we believe there is a threat to our planet - that of climate change - we need cooperative efforts on all sides. So, yes, we do have more stringent conditions than in some other parts of the world, but we are also viewing this as an opportunity to develop new technologies so that we can meet our targets without putting at risk our companies, because we do not want to export our companies and our jobs.
President Barroso, as you mentioned, interest rates are indeed affected by the state of the economy. They reflect the confidence in a particular economy and the international economic community is affected by them. Interest rates are affected by the confidence the Community has in a particular economy and that confidence is, in turn, affected many times by statements on the confidence that the European Commission shows in measures taken by Member States. In that sense, speculators also try to speculate on a bad economic situation and sometimes make it worse.
President of the Commission. - I have already said that I was happy to hear yesterday Prime Minister Papandreou's commitment to cut the public deficit and reduce government debt through permanent expenditure cuts and revenue increases. I even added that the 2010 budget currently being discussed in the Greek Parliament and the Prime Minister's statement are steps in the right direction. Naturally, the Commission will continue to monitor closely the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and the implementation of the measures in Greece. This is very clear in my statement of support for the measures announced. I believe that this is the best way we can help Greece in the very difficult situation they are now facing in terms of budget and debt. I trust those measures will have some important results.
I want to ask him about a policy to help framework conditions for research and innovation - which I was rather disappointed to see did not make it into this first draft of 2020, but I hope will be there in future - and that is to harness the huge potential of public procurement, throughout the European Union, to stimulate innovative products and services. I want to ask him today if he would take up the recommendations endorsed almost unanimously by this Parliament in my report last November, which showed how this could be done. Just to give him an idea and to share it with colleagues, if 1% of European public procurement was secured for innovative products and services, it would raise the investment in innovation across the European Union by no less than EUR 15 billion.
Do not expect from me in a reply of one minute to give a decisive answer to such an important issue as the one you have put forward. I am aware of your report. I am aware of some of the interesting proposals you have made in terms of public procurement and, yes, it is also my intention, it is in the broad guidelines. I presented this to Parliament, as you will remember, in a reference to the need to deepen those commitments in terms of more market friendly, more innovative public procurement rules in Europe. This is certainly going to be part of our future strategy but I cannot, at this stage, commit to exactly how it will be incorporated.
The point we are at today is the following: we believe it is important to set priorities for the future, to see what we have to spend at national level and what we have to spend at European level, and then to have a discussion about the fair way of sharing that investment. However, we believe that in some cases, it makes more sense to spend a euro at European level than at national level because of the potential benefits of exploring the European dimension and the European internal market. We will come to that discussion and, I hope, at the end, we will come to an agreement.
With these conclusions, the Council and the Presidency want to send a very clear and strong message from Europe that we hope may result in the negotiations between the parties being resumed soon. We are concerned about the lack of progress in the peace process in the Middle East. We have therefore made clear our support for the efforts by the United States to achieve peace. The EU is calling on the parties to accept responsibility and begin negotiations on all final status issues, including Jerusalem, borders, refugees and security. Our conclusions also reflect the EU's position on the Middle East, based on international law, that we have held for a long time and that we have expressed on many occasions.
The EU's position is, among other things, that an agreed two-state solution must be based on the 1967 borders and that the settlements are illegal. Jerusalem is a final status issue and we have made it clear that, if genuine peace is to be achieved, Jerusalem's status as the future capital of two states must be settled through negotiations. Resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations was linked to the settlement issue for a large part of the year. Recently, the Israeli Government announced a partial and temporary settlement freeze. The Foreign Affairs Council welcomes this decision and we hope that it will contribute to a resumption of meaningful negotiations.
However, we note with concern the surprising decision by the Israeli Government on 13 December to make the settlements part of the National Priority Areas programme for the first time. This goes against the spirit of the settlement freeze and damages the efforts to create an atmosphere that can help to bring about a long-term resolution of the conflict. My colleague, the Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation, Gunilla Carlsson, visited the Committee on Development in the European Parliament at the beginning of September. She promised to follow developments locally, to provide assistance and to intervene in the areas that we are all aware of - the situation in and around East Jerusalem, the settlements and issues such as access and movement, particularly with regard to Gaza. We have fulfilled this promise.
Over recent months, under the leadership of the Presidency, the EU has adopted a clear position with regard to the settlements and the continued closure of Gaza. The policy of closure is unacceptable and counterproductive. The EU is continuing to demand that the border crossings be opened immediately and unconditionally for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons. The Council has also called for the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1860 and for international humanitarian law to be respected. Those holding the abducted Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, must release him immediately.
Our diplomats in the region have followed the situation in East Jerusalem closely. In their view, Israel is weakening the Palestinian community in the city. This causes us concern. The EU will increase its assistance to East Jerusalem to ease the living conditions of the Palestinians. The strong message concerning East Jerusalem in the Council's conclusions is clear evidence of our concern for the situation. It is important to remember that settlements between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon are prerequisites for there to be peace in the Middle East. The EU welcomes the recent statements by Israel and Syria confirming their willingness to advance the peace process. It goes without saying that this would have extremely positive repercussions in the whole region.
Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Mr President, the Council adopted very substantive conclusions on the Middle East peace process last week. These set out a principled position on a number of crucial issues in a clear and determined manner. I will not dwell on the conclusions or repeat what the Presidency has said. Suffice to say that in reaffirming our principles, I hope we may have helped restore some Palestinian confidence and willingness to enter into the peace process. The conclusions, of course, will also be of great help to me, in providing me with a clear steer for the months to come.
You have invited me here today to talk about our political work, but also about the situation in East Jerusalem. This is an area of deep concern. East Jerusalem is occupied territory, together with the rest of the West Bank. The EU is opposed to the demolition of Palestinian homes, the eviction of Palestinian families, the construction of Israeli settlements and the route of the 'separation barrier'. The EU is addressing these issues at political level, through diplomatic channels and in our public statements. We are also addressing the situation through practical assistance, aimed at supporting the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem. For example, there is a lack of 1 200 classrooms for Palestinian children in the city, so we are helping to reinforce education facilities. In addition, we enable Palestinian hospitals in East Jerusalem to remain viable and we do a lot of work with Palestinian young people in the city who suffer from high rates of unemployment and psychological problems. To date, in East Jerusalem, the EU is implementing activities costing EUR 4.6 million.
It is now time to move to action and put the Council conclusions into practice. We now need to think about how we can re-engage a political process. The two sides appear to have strayed further apart, in terms of engaging on an end game. I will be travelling to the region shortly and my main objective will be to meet the main actors and see first hand how the EU can be a force for change. I believe we all agree with the overall and overriding priority of a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations - not negotiations for negotiations' sake, but negotiations to achieve a peace deal and turn the page. We cannot - nor, I doubt, can the region - tolerate another round of fruitless negotiations. Negotiations have taken place on and off for several years starting with the Oslo Declaration of Principles signed in September 1993. That was 16 years ago. Negotiations should be based on international law and respect previous agreements. All issues should be on the table including the status of Jerusalem as the future shared capital.
The US remains an indispensable and crucial actor in the Middle East. Conditions for an effective EU-US partnership on the Middle East have rarely been as good. It is time to turn this into a reality by closely coordinating our positions and strategy. The EU will continue to support and work closely with the US via the Quartet. The Quartet needs reinvigoration - the current stalemate in the peace process demands it. The Quartet can provide the careful, yet dynamic, mediation that is required.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, during a visit of young Israeli and Palestinian leaders to the European Parliament, a thorough discussion was held which outlined a peace settlement for their future - a secure and recognised two-state solution, on the basis of the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the capital for both; demilitarisation of the Palestinian state; the reiteration of the 2007 Arab peace initiative; NATO guarantees; and the refugee issue to be arranged in a way that does not alter the demographic character of the Hebrew state.
While the young have a vision of a common future, their seniors still argue about whether they should begin negotiations. The Egyptian initiative for inter-Palestinian reconciliation - so that there is one interlocutor - is still pondering and the security arrangement in Gaza, with the liberation of prisoners, such as Gilad Shalit, is still awaited. In the meantime, the faits accomplis on the ground, according to the report by the EU Head of Mission in East Jerusalem, renders the Palestinian state less and less viable.
Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Swedish Presidency for this initiative. It was a good initiative and I would like to congratulate you on it. I would also like to thank Baroness Ashton for sitting on the Commission's side on her first appearance here, even though she has spoken primarily in her role as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. This is all about a common foreign and security policy. In some ways, it may not be important where you sit. What is important is that you are here and that you are representing a common foreign policy.
A few days ago, we were in the US having discussions with our colleagues from Congress. When faced with one-sided approach of Congress and its lack of understanding of the situation of the Palestinians, President Obama has very few options open to him. We have great sympathy for the situation in Israel. We are also opposed to any form of terrorism and we want the captured soldier to be returned to his family at last. However, we are equally concerned about and sympathetic towards the unfortunate position which the Palestinians find themselves in with regard to everything referred to in this statement and, in particular, the 1967 borders, the difficult situation in Jerusalem and the settlement activities. It is completely incomprehensible, although it is a continuation of the policy of the last few years, that a highly conflicting approach is being taken to settlement growth. First it was stopped and then it was included in the national priority programme. After this, only natural development continued and then roads were built which cut through Palestinian settlements. The way in which land is being taken away from the Palestinians on a day-to-day basis is totally unacceptable.
What happened to a delegation from Parliament is also completely unacceptable. Mr de Rossa will also give his view on this. The Members of this Parliament must join together with the Council and the Commission to state clearly that Members of Parliament have the right to travel to Gaza and to see the situation there for themselves. What does Israel have to hide? Why is it preventing Members of Parliament from going to Gaza? We must not accept this and I hope that we will oppose it jointly. Transparency and openness, among other things, are the prerequisites for a reasonable Middle East policy. We must give this our clear support.
Ladies and gentlemen, we debate the Middle East every few months, and sometimes it seems like the Echternach procession: one small step forward, then signs of a backwards step, then more cause for hope. Unfortunately, there is also cause for despondency, but we continue to hope, of course. It is of the utmost importance, of course - including to my group - that both Israelis and Palestinians be able to live side by side in peace in two separate states, to benefit from all the available development opportunities and to guarantee each other's security. I believe we all agree on this. We also agree on what steps would ideally lead to this and, of course, we are prepared to make our contribution.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission, but my question to them both is when are we are going to go beyond the fine words - which I very much agree with - when are we going to have real action? We have heard the same words over and again that we need to ensure that Israel does this or does that, but we need the real leverage to make that happen, otherwise Israel will simply ignore us, as it continues to do.
I also pay tribute to the authors of the EU Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem itself. That report speaks with a clarity and vision which is all too often absent in these debates. It sets out how Israel's policy of illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is deliberately designed to weaken the Palestinian community in the city and prevent Palestinian development. But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report, and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that.
Mr President, particularly at this time of Advent, many are praying for peace in the Middle East, but sometimes one loses heart and thinks this peace will never come. It is, nevertheless, important that all parties continue to work for peace, yet therein may lie the main problem. Are all parties able and willing to work for peace? Israel has already taken action to exchange land for peace in the past - I am thinking of its withdrawal from parts of the Gaza Strip - but, unfortunately, this did not lead to peace. Indeed, the rocket fire increased and, in 2009, Israel invaded the Gaza Strip. Now, Israel has announced a temporary halt to construction on the West Bank. A series of roadblocks has also been removed. This was a gesture to help bring about peace talks.
This action by the Netanyahu Government is already fairly far-reaching by Israeli standards, yet I still see little movement on the Palestinian side. People keep saying that what Israel does is of no account, but I fail to see a Palestinian gesture to enable talks. Is the Palestinian side willing and able to bring about further talks? Hamas seems to be embroiled in its struggle with Fatah and to be kept on a tight leash by Iran. Mahmoud Abbas seems to be a paper tiger, no longer wielding much influence to speak of. I think it is time the Palestinian side, too, made clear that it wants peace.
In addition to advocating the solution of two states, the European Union should take specific measures against Israel. The continuing violation of human rights is sufficient cause for the European Union to impose sanctions on the basis of Article 2 of the treaty, because if, on the one hand, it chooses to support the peace process but, on the other hand, continues to upgrade economic relations with Israel without limitation, the only thing it will achieve is to serve Israel's policy, which consists of forcing the Palestinians to abandon their land and expanding Israeli sovereignty to the whole of Palestine.
Mr President, has Europe taken leave of its senses? This rhetorical question was put by the United States at the start of December. The subject of this fierce criticism from Congress was the unilateral designation of East Jerusalem as the capital of the envisaged Palestinian State in a draft Council Resolution in circulation. As Chair of the EP Delegation for relations with Israel, I had imagined and hoped for a more constructive start to our transatlantic dialogue. Also, I hasten to add, careful examination of both the draft and the final Council statement left me, like our counterparts in Congress, extremely dismayed. I distance myself emphatically from the proposal to divide Jerusalem, in particular. I consider the Council statement on the Middle East to be a serious diplomatic and political setback for the peace process, and hence am very disappointed in the Foreign Ministers for being led by the Swedish Presidency, of all presidencies, with its strained relations with the Jewish State.
I have several fundamental objections to the said Council statement. This is hardly the way to encourage the Palestinian Authority to resume talks with Israel. In addition, the statement goes against the Quartet's principle, laid down on 9 November 2008, that 'third parties should not intervene in the bilateral negotiations'. The official reaction of the United States to the Council statement of 8 December underlined this principle once more. Is there nothing for it, then, but to resign ourselves to the impasse in the peace process? Absolutely not! Following recent delegation visits to Israel, I firmly believe that a gradual, solid process of rapprochement between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority is both necessary and possible. Gradually transferring administration on the West Bank, for example in Area C, and strengthening economic cooperation, whilst strengthening and establishing reliable Palestinian institutions, will really move the peace process forward. I call on the Council and the Commission, therefore, to stop making counterproductive declarations on the peace process and instead to invest in specific projects involving cooperation between the Israelis and Palestinians. This is an established European formula, is it not?
Mr President, as a member of the parliamentary delegation to Israel, I listened with interest to the Foreign Affairs Council's comments on the Middle East peace process and the Commission's statement. However, I, like my previous colleague, are left with an overriding sense of concern in relation to these. Israel is the only functioning democracy in the region. The favourite tactics of its opponents have been terrorism against the state. I believe that the Council and the Commission statements fail to give proper weight to Israel's security concerns. In fact, I did not hear the High Representative mention those concerns in her statement to this House.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to welcome Baroness Ashton to her new position. I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency for the resolution and for acknowledging that it will not be possible to implement the two-state solution in the long term unless we can solve the settlement problem. The Heads of Mission report has been mentioned several times and we also believe that it is very good. On this basis, I have two questions. What is the current status of this report and where will it be published? Secondly, what will you, the Commission and the Council, do to implement the recommendations in the report? I would now like to quote three of the recommendations from the report. The first is:
However, our words in this House will clearly have no effect if we do not follow them up with concrete acts. We must act and, to do so, we can suspend the European Union-Israel association agreement until such time as the Israeli Government complies with international law. We therefore need to act to ensure an end to the colonisation, the lifting of the blockade of Gaza, the destruction of the wall of shame, the return of the refugees, and the release of all the political prisoners.
I would, however, like to add that we must now proceed to take action, since the situation in Jerusalem is deteriorating on a daily basis and cannot be tolerated any further. There are problems of blatant violations of international law, there are difficulties which are causing great suffering to many persons, including expulsion from their homes, destruction of their residences, and the construction of illegal residences. We cannot remain silent in the face of such injustices, because by doing so, we would be conveying the message that law, diplomacy, and the much cherished principle of peaceful solution of conflicts are worthless. I do not think that we would have allowed this to happen in our country. We must therefore act by creating the right environment conducive to confidence building between the two parties, and to have two distinct and viable states which can cohabit peacefully. Kindly allow me to give credit to the instrumental role Jordan is playing in this regard. A final word to Baroness Ashton - you have been assigned a new role by the Lisbon Treaty, an important role which provides us with an opportunity. Let us please not miss this opportunity.
They were days filled with emotion and suffering, etched on the faces of the children gripping the window bars of their homes on the Hebron road, the deserted road that no Palestinian is allowed to cross. We saw the suffering of an 85-year-old woman, driven out of her occupied home, forced to sleep in the cold in a tent set up in the garden of what used to be her own house, and the suffering on the faces of the Palestinians who had built a farm using European funds, subsequently destroyed by Israeli soldiers.
Israel has the right to be an independent state, but the Palestinians also have the right to a homeland, a state and a passport. The decision of the Council of Europe represents a considerable step forward, but we need to act immediately. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just the tip of the iceberg in a larger conflict. On the final day of our visit, the Israeli authorities prevented us, the European Parliament delegation, from visiting the Gaza Strip. I believe that in this regard, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, should step in to protest on behalf of democratic Europe.
(NL) Mr President, in their report of 23 November, the EU Heads of Delegation in Jerusalem and Ramallah made very clear that Israel is actively engaged in illegally annexing East Jerusalem and completely isolating it from the rest of the West Bank. I ask myself, therefore, why the Foreign Affairs Council is not drawing the right conclusions from this. Why is it simply disregarding the specific recommendations, in particular, of such an important factual report - its own report, at that - knowing that the current developments are irreversible and, in so doing, even casting serious doubt on the chances of establishing an independent, viable Palestinian State alongside the State of Israel? The Middle East peace process has no need for woolly pronouncements. It is high time and the right moment for the European Union to assume an active, visible role in the region, and this is only possible, of course, if we also show the courage to take a clear and unequivocal position, particularly on East Jerusalem.
The Council has tried to bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, despite their opposition to some Israeli measures, and we, too, are insisting that needless obstacles to the peace process are removed as soon as possible. The demolition of Palestinians' homes in East Jerusalem and the building of settlements and separation barriers on occupied territory are not acceptable. It is also unacceptable, however, for us to expose Israel and not to manage to defend it actively against all attacks and terrorist activities aimed against citizens of the State of Israel.
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, in other words, the Palestinian parliament. Last week, our delegation was refused entry to Gaza by Israel. The situation in Gaza is very disturbing, particularly now that winter has come. Only 10% of the population can obtain the supplies they need by smuggling goods through the tunnels and this is exactly why the tunnels are tolerated by everyone.
On the Goldstone report, I would like to congratulate Mr Bildt, on behalf of the Presidency, for praising the - and I quote - 'credibility and high integrity' of the Goldstone report. I do think it would be useful if Mrs Malmström could repeat today in the European Parliament what her Ambassador said in the United Nations - that the EU urges Israel and the Palestinians to launch appropriate, credible and independent domestic investigations of human rights violations in relation to the Gaza conflict.
Under the Swedish Presidency, we had become used to better, much better. Mrs Malmström, please forgive my frankness. Designating, decreeing, as she has done, East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian State - just to begin with, I know - is, in my view, a rare diplomatic error - I am speaking euphemistically here. The error is not one of substance - let no one be mistaken about what I am saying here - but the way in which this declaration, which prejudges the final outcome of the negotiations, patronises, indeed scorns, the parties concerned. Moreover, there are many Member States that have taken a stand and kept their distance from this first draft of the text.
So yes, of course, a thousand times yes to an open capital, a shared capital, this form of sharing that, since the 2000s now, has been part of the Clinton Parameters for a negotiated peace, a principle that has been accepted by Ehud Barak in Taba, and by others too. Furthermore, we also remember, in this very Chamber, the powerful way in which it was defended by Avraham Burg and Ahmed Qurei. Jerusalem: a sacred city for three religions, the capital city of books, an open capital. The only thing is, our role is not to impose sharing, a timetable or methods, but - as was said earlier - to encourage dialogue so as to enable the parties concerned, Palestinians and Israelis, to come to a conclusion.
Indeed, the right approach is the one also stressed by the Council conclusions, which is to reaffirm the further development of bilateral relations with Israel. However tempting it is, the Council can only be an influential player politically, as well as with economic support, if it resists the temptations - motivated sometimes by frustration at one or other of the parties - to have some sort of sanctions or punish one or the other. It is too complex a situation and it simply undermines a consistent, coherent EU pressure on both parties to get back to the table and have a peace agreement.
(SL) I, too, am against the language of sanctions and threats and I, too, am in favour of a constructive policy and dialogue. However, I regret that we have heard far too often today the message that Israel is a democratic state. Israel is a state which is not behaving democratically when it comes to the Palestinians and when it comes to our common objective, which is the establishment of two independent, self-confident and secure states which will co-exist alongside each other. This is why, Baroness Ashton, I think that today you have been given many incentives for the development of a more constructive and a more effective European Union policy. I regret to say that Israel continues to see us as a paper tiger, not as a real entity with which it ought to establish a dialogue and which could be useful in resolving the problem.
Finally, I would like to say that it is extremely gratifying to see the high level of support in this House for the conclusions. Everyone, with some slightly differing opinions of course, appreciates how important it is to try in every way possible to support the peace process in the Middle East and we all feel an enormous amount of frustration about the fact that it is progressing so desperately slowly. The peace of Christmas that will soon settle over this Chamber and many places in the world will once again not be experienced in the way we would like it to be in the region this year.
At the beginning of the Swedish Presidency, we had hoped that the efforts of US President Obama would bear fruit in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. It is important for the EU and the US to work closely together. This has not happened yet, but - as always with regard to this issue - we must be patient and persistent. The EU must be consistent and stand firm in its message with regard to East Jerusalem, borders, settlements and security. I am very pleased at the high level of consensus here in Parliament, including with regard to our conclusions, which are clear and consistent. They will form the basis for the EU's work for a long time to come. In this regard, it will be important for all institutions to work closely together.
The EU is continuing its European security and defence policy mission in the region, and the European Union Police Co-ordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support (Eupol Copps), in particular, has made a significant contribution over the last year to improving the social and economic conditions for Palestinians in the West Bank. The EU also supports the preparations for the formation of an independent Palestinian state. A lot of work is needed here, and we, of course, support the programme drawn up by the Palestinian authorities: Palestine: Ending the Occupation, Establishing a State.
In order to put an end to this conflict, a negotiated settlement must be reached between the parties. This must include all of the issues. We cannot accept a solution that is determined through unilateral measures, which then becomes a fait accompli. The solution must be comprehensive. It must include the Lebanese and Syrian track and it must be part of a regional strategy that settles the Arab-Israeli conflict. We are not there yet, but the EU has nevertheless taken a huge step forward. All of the institutions are very much in agreement about the need for this and I look forward to continued cooperation on this matter.
Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Mr President, can I just say that the issue of where I sit, I suspect, will keep coming back. I am sitting here because the Council is over there. I may have to go and sit over there or you may have to build me a seat equidistant, because I assure you I will be in trouble somewhere for wherever I sit. It is a great delight, though, to be here with Cecilia and I look forward very much to working with her.
What strikes me about the debate that we have just had is that pretty much - and I think, Mr Atkins, you may be the exception in what you said, though I listened with great care - there is a shared conviction that what we are looking for is a two-state solution. There is an enormous amount of passion from all parliamentarians, especially, if I may say, Mr De Rossa and those Members who have recently come back, and who have clearly seen for themselves the dreadful situation that exists on the ground.
I believe what is significant about the Council conclusions is that they are very clear. They give me a real sense of the direction that we need to move in. What is also very clear - and I pay tribute to the Presidency for the work that they have done on this - is the frustration in this House that things are not moving, frustration borne of views that are sometimes quite different, but nonetheless converge on a desire to see a solution. The nuances are important. The views that you hold on the differences, as well as the similarities, matter to me as I navigate our future in these discussions and negotiations.
There is no doubt to me that we have got to do two things. One is the rather political issues that you quite rightly raise. What is our relationship to be? I am at the beginning of that journey, and this debate is extremely important to me in listening to the views that have been put forward. What I take away from it is, first of all, that the Quartet must demonstrate that it is worth the money, that it is actually able to be reinvigorated. I have already talked with the staff by video link in Jerusalem, I have already talked to Mr Blair about his work and I have already talked to Secretary of State Clinton about the same things. It is very important, if it is going to work, that the word 'reinvigorate' is absolutely right.
That brings me, in a sense, to what I call the practical. A number of colleagues have raised particular issues, whether it is a question of what the UK is doing on labelling, whether it is issues about the association agreement, whether this report - the Heads of Mission report - and the recommendations that I have not yet considered within it are there. We need to consider all of these issues carefully, but what we have got to do is demonstrate the practical support that we put on the ground.
That is the most significant and practical thing I need to do first of all. I would describe the work that I want to do as this: we have the potential to do the political and the economic. What I want to do is draw those two things together, to find a way in which we can enhance what we do, to support the work that is going on, to make the Quartet more effective, to bring together what has been, in a sense, the Council and Commission operating side by side, and to meld it into one so that what we do on the ground really makes a difference.
During the last Foreign Affairs Council, the Council of the European Union made it known that it wanted a Palestinian state to be created in the near future, within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital. Europe is thus outlining the conditions of a viable solution to the Middle East conflict that is acceptable to both parties. The solution proposed by the Council is fair. Israel and Palestine can use it as a basis on which to exchange land for peace. The European Union has a major role to play. It can support inter-Palestinian reconciliation, without which there will be no Palestinian interlocutor in the negotiations with Israel. It can encourage the resumption of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean.
in writing. - I welcome the recent Council conclusions on this matter, particularly regarding the issue of East Jerusalem. The Council has set out a clear position on several key issues, including the 1967 borders, Israeli settlements, access to Gaza, and support for a two-state solution in which Jerusalem would be a shared capital. These remain some of the crucial sticking points and the Council has succeeded in addressing them in its conclusions. The Council has provided the EU's High Representative with a list of concrete objectives and a clear direction in which the EU wants to see the negotiations moving. I am hopeful that this clarity and unity from the Member States will lead to more effective EU involvement in the negotiations, and an increased capacity to engage with other key actors in the peace process.
Mr President, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms are what the EU stands for. In the fight against terrorism, however, the EU is less principled. Take the UN blacklist, for example. People or entities suspected of having links with Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda network or the Taliban can be placed on this list, which results in a travel ban and the freezing of their financial assets. This measure is all well and good as far as terrorism is concerned, as this terrorism must be fought - that is beyond dispute - but the lawlessness with which terrorists operate must not be allowed to creep into the way we fight terrorism.
Once a person's name is on the list, it is very difficult to have it removed. There have already been enough cases of people listed wrongfully for many years who had to fight for due legal process. They are condemned to poverty, cannot key in their PIN to pay for shopping and are not allowed to leave their countries. I am arguing today not for more rights for terror suspects but only for them to be able to rely on their rights like anyone else. I advocate transparent procedures and due legal process for everyone.
The list also has far-reaching side effects. Since authorities can decide to place people or organisations on the list, this can also be used as a political tool. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) fighting for human rights, for example, who are a thorn in the government's side, can be designated as terrorist organisations to paralyse their activities. The Commission was forced to revise the current procedures by a judgment of the European Court. The Commission gave this a decent impetus, but it failed at Council level.
A new situation has now arisen as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Is it to be Article 215 or Article 75 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union? In other words, is the European Parliament to take no part in examining the proposals, or is it to be involved via the normal procedure, namely codecision? The Committee on Legal Affairs has indicated that Article 75 is the correct legal basis, as has Parliament's Legal Service. I should like both the Council and the Commission to tell us today how they see the way ahead for these proposals for restrictive measures. What role is envisaged here for Parliament? It is time we had transparent, democratic procedures. The question is whether we can count on your cooperation.
Restrictive measures against third countries, individuals, natural or legal persons or other entities are an important tool for the EU in its foreign and security policy. In general, you could say that they are used to bring about a change in a particular policy or activity. They should, of course, be used as part of an integrated, comprehensive policy that may include political dialogue, various forms of incentive and conditions that need to be met. Restrictive measures alone are not always sufficient to bring about a change, but they can be a way of exerting pressure on repressive regimes or stopping the flow of money and other resources that support such regimes or terrorist networks.
In some cases, restrictive measures are introduced by the Council when we implement resolutions that have been adopted by the UN Security Council in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter. In such cases, the EU's various legal instruments must adhere strictly to these resolutions. They relate to situations and acts, including terrorism, that constitute a threat to peace and security. They can only form part of the EU's external action and, in that way, they differ from measures to create our own area of freedom, security and justice, which is, of course, our goal within the Union.
The Council interprets the Treaty of Lisbon in such a way as to apply Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of these and other restrictive measures within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, including with regard to terrorism. The EU can also decide to apply further measures alongside those decided by the UN and we can also introduce measures on our own. Sanctions that the EU decides on by itself can be introduced to support other foreign and security policy objectives - respect for human rights, democracy, the principles of the rule of law and good governance - all in accordance with the EU's obligations under international law.
The measures are currently most often levelled directly against those who have been identified as being responsible for the policy or the measures that we are opposed to, or against their interests or their sources of income. This is more effective than broader sanctions in the form of general trade embargoes or other more arbitrary measures. Targeted sanctions are intended to minimise the negative impact that these measures can have on the population of the country in question. This is a very important consideration when the Council is preparing a decision regarding the introduction of new sanctions.
All sanctions are reviewed regularly to assess their effectiveness. They may be adjusted or lifted completely, depending on the developments. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, restrictive measures will also continue to be used as a tool within the common foreign and security policy by means of Council Decisions in accordance with Article 29 of the treaty. One important change in the new treaty is that decisions on restrictive measures relating to natural or legal persons are now subject to legal review. This means that the court can examine whether a decision regarding sanctions is lawful. This was not the case previously.
With the experience that we have gained in applying sanctions, we have carried out thorough assessments and have looked at how sanctions can be imposed in a constructive way. A number of tangible improvements have been introduced. These include a requirement for the criteria for using certain sanctions to be specified, as well as the grounds for including an individual, a natural or legal person or other entities on a sanctions list. This must be continually reviewed and adjusted if necessary. In this work, the Council has taken account of the European Parliament resolution from last year on the evaluation of EU sanctions as part of the EU's actions and policies in the area of human rights.
A number of UN Security Council resolutions have set out the procedures for handling the sanctions list at UN level. Most recently, UN Security Council Resolution 1822 provided that a summary of reasons should be made available on the UN al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee's website in connection with each listed person, and provided for a review of all names on the list by 30 June 2010, with provision for regular review thereafter. The resolution demanded that the relevant state take measures to inform the listed person of their listing, the reasons for it and information about exemptions and delisting requests.
The strengthening of Parliament's powers has been a keynote in a number of politicians' speeches on the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The President of the Commission, Dr Barroso, for example, said the following here in Strasbourg on 25 November, on the preparation of the European Council: 'Now the Lisbon Treaty gives us a new opportunity to move ahead. We all know that freedom, security and justice will see some of the most significant changes from the treaty. [...] And, in particular, it extends the democratic framework for these policies by the full involvement of your Parliament.' I would emphasise 'the full involvement of your Parliament.'
In his first official speech, the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, also said that the treaty was a powerful tool with which we can face the challenges of our times. If that is the case, then, it would make no sense to highlight the strengthening of our powers and competences in official discourse and then to adopt a restrictive interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon, so as to deprive Parliament of prerogatives that it used to have and which it would make no sense to lose.
The questions that have been asked are, therefore, based on common sense, but this common sense goes beyond a mere evaluation of doctrine and the consistency between declared intentions and their interpretation. There is also a practical consequence, which arises from the old saying that he who can do the greater can certainly do the lesser, and it concerns the following: what sense is there for a body that has competence in criminal matters and in preventing and combating terrorist attacks, through being involved in a codecision process, to be subsequently excluded a priori when other measures are at stake which, by affecting citizens' rights, may even also be important in this context?
Therefore - I am finishing, Mr President - it is fundamentally important that the way the Treaty of Lisbon is interpreted in legislation corresponds in reality to the stated strengthening of Parliament's powers and competences. At the very least, in some cases, as was raised in the question, it should be possible to have a dual legal basis when the rights of citizens are at stake and anti-terrorism policies are threatened. In other cases, such as Zimbabwe and Somalia, for example, optional consultation should be envisaged, as in fact is enshrined in the Stuttgart Declaration on the European Union, which was also mentioned in the question. That is the position that I wanted to set out here, Mr President.
I am minded to speak on this today because a month ago, I was at the Palace of Westminster. There, in our democratic parliament, very close to both the House of Lords and to the House of Commons, I met several Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan. With them was a leading Sikh I have come to know. His forebears stood shoulder to shoulder with my forebears, fighting for democracy in those conflicts which have so disfigured this Europe of ours. As a result, you and 700 others have the freedom to come from the four corners of Europe to meet in this place.
(DE) Mr President, Article 75 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union governs the implementation of restrictive measures to combat terrorism and, therefore, any intrusions into citizens' property rights, such as freezing bank accounts. While these provisions concern police cooperation in criminal matters, Article 215 refers to the common foreign and security policy. However, the Council has sole authority in this area. As a result, on one page, in Article 75, Parliament is a colegislator and, on another page, in Article 215, Parliament only has to be informed about events. However, both articles concern possible intrusions into the individual rights of citizens or legal persons, which is why the Council and the Commission must explain what the relationship between these two provisions is and why Parliament is not involved in the case of Article 215 in particular.
Leaving aside the legal aspect that I hope will be solved through good cooperation between the European institutions, I would like to draw your attention to the important problem that we are debating here, which is fighting terrorism and terrorism-related activities, such as the ones carried out by Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda network. I think that when it comes to such sensitive topics, we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as EU-internal and EU-external issues, because terrorist actions might be planned outside the EU but can seriously affect the people living inside the EU.
Let us look at one aspect at a time, starting with the proposals relating to Zimbabwe and Somalia. I accept that here we are dealing with the application of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, and as such, they clearly come under the Union's external actions. In principle, Article 215 seems to be the most appropriate. According to this article, however, any acts adopted in accordance with it should include the necessary provisions on legal safeguards, but this requirement is not met in either of the proposals.
With regard to the third proposal on persons and groups associated with Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda network or the Taliban, the idea that this comes under the Union's external actions is untenable, as Mr Luhan has just stated. Since preventing and fighting terrorism are one of the top priorities among the European Union's internal actions, this objective is explicitly included under Article 75 of the Treaty of Lisbon. That, then, should be the most appropriate legal basis, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.
Mr President, the Swedish Presidency has spent a considerable amount of time getting the Treaty of Lisbon in place. We are extremely proud of the fact that it has now entered into force. It contains significant improvements, which will be good for the European Union and for European citizens. One of the most important changes that the Treaty of Lisbon brings is precisely the introduction of the power of codecision for the European Parliament in the area of justice, security and freedom. This will give the European Parliament the power of codecision in a lot of areas. That is a good thing and it will increase the quality of the legislation that we produce together. It will also increase legal certainty and that is very important, as these are sensitive and difficult areas.
I would also like to thank you for your support with regard to the introduction of sanctions against terrorists, individuals or regimes that oppress people and deny them their human rights. Sanctions and respect for human rights and legal certainty are not mutually exclusive - quite the contrary. Sanctions can be very effective and legitimate if, at the same time, they have legal certainty. I can assure you that the European Parliament will be involved in the formulation of new rules, including those relating to terrorism, with the power of codecision under Article 75 when it comes to sanctions within the European Union.
The third and final thing I would say is about legal certainty. I spent many hours taking the Lisbon Treaty through a parliament so at one time, I knew the treaty extremely well. The interpretation of Article 75 of course is how you refer back to Article 67 and the relevance of that within the context, and so the legal advice we have got is to try and seek to clarify where indeed this now fits. The advice we have is clear. Members of Parliament of course are at liberty to contest that, but I think it is very important that wherever we arrive in this, there is legal certainty.
It was also due to the determination of the Commission to recognise that all three institutions needed a cultural change. We needed to see that openness and transparency did not prevent democracy from flourishing, but actually improved it. It allowed accountability. It allowed citizens to see what was being done in their name and, arguably, it helped us to lift the curtain and to prove once and for all that there were no terrible secrets hidden in the safes of the Commission or the Council - I am not so sure about Parliament, but hopefully not in Parliament's safes either!
I want to thank in particular the Commissioner and, if I may, my dear former colleague, Cecilia Malmström, for that commitment. Now we need another commitment. As I said, we have achieved a huge amount. We have a register of documents. We have the jurisprudence of the ECJ, now defining and redefining what was originally agreed on access to documents. We have accepted the principle that all documents should remain accessible and that, where not accessible, access should be reasoned against quite clearly and specifically in reference to either Article 4 - the exemptions - or Article 9 - sensitive documents.
However, as we have moved on, Parliament has called repeatedly for a revision. I believe that the revision the Commission placed before Parliament, on which we subsequently voted in committee and the first reading of which was deferred in March of this year, did not go far enough, and I know we have a difference of opinion on this. Equally there were concerns - and those concerns still remain in this House - that there was an attempt to claw back on access to documents, not least in the redefining of documents - the notion that whole files could be exempted - and attempting to redefine the notion of the third-party veto.
It is interesting that our citizens sitting in the gallery must be thinking that we are talking about something that happens in outer space - articles, third-party vetoes - but actually what we are talking about is a law that allows them to make sure that we are accountable: parliamentarians accountable for what we do in their name, the Commission for what it does in their name, and, equally, the Council. How can they do that and the NGOs do that if the way we work and who does what within all of the different units remains a well-kept secret, open only to those lobbyists and those lawyers who know?
That is what I believe is at the heart of the Treaty of Lisbon. It says that we need to further enhance democracy. We need to enhance access to documents. That is why Parliament, in this oral question, is calling for a whole range of recommendations to be undertaken. Basically, it is about ensuring that the rights that we have are built upon, that they are not diminished, and about recognising that under Lisbon, it is no longer just the three institutions but all of the agencies and the bodies set up by them, including the European Central Bank, in some instances, the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, Europol and Eurojust. All of these institutions are now accountable under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
This morning, I had the great pleasure of meeting with Commission Vice-President, Margot Wallström, and Parliament's Vice-President, Diana Wallis, in the Interinstitutional Committee on Public Access to Documents. The meeting took place on the initiative of the Swedish Presidency. The committee had not met for two years. We had some very positive and specific discussions on how we could improve the opportunities for citizens to access the institutions' documents in practice. We should have meetings more often, and that was also one of our joint conclusions.
I am pleased that the Treaty of Lisbon places a great deal of importance on transparency, public scrutiny and democracy. We welcome this. As regards the review of Regulation (EC) No 1049, which we refer to as the Transparency Regulation, the Presidency wishes, first and foremost, to focus on the new legal basis for the Regulation. This is contained in Article 15(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon. The most important change in the new legal basis is the extension of the institutional scope. In plain language, this means that, while the previous article only applied to the documents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the new article extends the public's right to access documents to include all of the European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. There are certain restrictions with regard to the documents of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank, but it is a significantly larger area than it was previously.
Since May 2008, the Council's Information Working Group has gone through the proposal twice. The second technical run-through was completed during June and July of this year and includes a number of the amendments that Parliament approved at the plenary sitting in March 2009. In May, Parliament decided not to conclude its formal reading of the Commission's proposal before the European Parliament. I would like to remind Parliament that my colleague, Beatrice Ask, who is the Swedish Minister for Justice, explained to the Committee on Civil liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 2 September 2009, at the beginning of the Swedish Presidency, that she was prepared to initiate discussions between the institutions. She asked specifically whether the newly-elected Parliament intended to continue working on the basis of the 92 amendments that had been adopted by Parliament in March 2009. The reason for her question was that, as the Presidency, we need to know Parliament's position, even it if was not necessarily in the form of a completed first reading.
In my opinion, Article 15(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is an entirely relevant legal basis for the proposal under the new treaty. Other articles relating to public scrutiny in general, better communication between the institutions and citizens and good administration are of utmost relevance to the institutions' work in order to reinforce democracy, efficiency and legitimacy. We also need to discuss how this type of objective should be realised. However, I am not convinced that there is space for them within the framework of the Transparency Regulation. For the sake of clarity, the Regulation should contain clear rules relating simply to public access to documents and not a lot else.
I also think that we have a great deal of credibility, being Swedish, both Cecilia Malmström and myself, and I do not think that people will doubt that we will continue to fight for openness and transparency. At the same time, we have had our rows because we also play different roles and sometimes we have to be very realistic about what we can achieve and we have to fight our corners in each institution. That is not always easy. I think the whole political climate has also changed and the political balance has changed and that has affected our discussions on these issues.
But our starting point, I would say, is absolutely the same and we also state that this particular regulation on access to documents has served us very well. Over the years, this has been an excellent tool that we also want to be used by more than the lobbyists and those who are paid for looking at all the documents. We want the general public and journalists to be able to use it and have full access to documents. That is my starting point. I know that I share this view, as you could hear, with the Minister.
Mr President, we had agreed with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups to submit an oral question about the status of the procedure and the next steps. On the basis of the response from the Council and the Commission, we planned to discuss how to proceed. We have just received this response in principle. It is not entirely clear to me why the rapporteur, contrary to the agreement between the groups, suddenly submitted a resolution in which he anticipated his own point of view. What answer does he want from the Commission and the Council? Mr Cashman, I hold you in great esteem, but all of this happened quietly and secretly, with a complete lack of transparency. So much for your claim to be fighting for transparency. You have tried to bypass us. In addition, I believe that the legitimacy of this resolution is highly questionable under the terms of the Rules of Procedure. In any case, the content of the resolution is a repeat of your existing report from the last parliamentary term and, therefore, is completely superfluous.
I know that you tried to negotiate with the shadow rapporteurs to introduce a joint resolution, but I am fundamentally opposed to this resolution. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has not, in my opinion, brought about such a change in the legal basis of the dossier that it has resulted in a change in the role of the European Parliament. The report was and is a dossier in the codecision procedure. This also explains the concerns of my group about the legitimacy of a resolution under the terms of the Rules of Procedure.
I do not want to discuss the content. You bring together a lot of different things, including quotations from the Treaty on European Union, from the Treaty of Lisbon and from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, all taken out of context, in order to legitimise your motion for a resolution. It is certainly not legally tenable in the absolute form in which it is presented. You have not made a commitment to confidentiality, which is clearly necessary at least to a certain extent. This is required, for example, in the context of international agreements by third parties as a conditio sine qua non. You only need to think about the agreement with the US on SWIFT. There is also no mediation solution, for example, in the form of ex-post transparency. You fail to provide this. In addition, other legally protected rights, such as data protection or the right to privacy, are disregarded.
It is clear that with the entry into force of Lisbon, we can go forward with a step change on the whole issue of transparency. As the Vice-President of this House responsible for transparency, I have not always found it an easy subject, but I do believe that now we have the chance to do better and to reach out even further to our citizens. Within this House, we are looking at our own arrangements for access to documents and access to information. For me, it was a real pleasure this morning to meet with Cecilia Malmström and Margot Wallström so that our three institutions for once could sit down together and really make some progress. It has already been referred to - and I think this, for us, is the big breakthrough - that, rather than this interinstitutional body that meets as and when, and two to three years apart, we have set ourselves six months to meet again and a much more regular timetable. We are serious, and this is a serious signal that we have made together, that we aim for a real transparency portal between all of us, that we aim to ensure that our citizens can see the legislative process as it progresses through all its stages, and that they can have a real input and real insight into what we do.
Mr President, in the opinion of many publicists interested in European affairs, what is known as a democracy deficit has been noticeable in the European institutions for many years. This accusation is sometimes made unfairly, but at other times, it does have a basis in fact. In the latter case, it is pointed out that when significant decisions are perceived as being made by anonymous European clerks somewhere in far-off Brussels, the democratic mechanism is not working properly. This is why it should be stressed that openness is an extremely significant element of the European Union's activity. Authority must be answerable to society. Otherwise, as history has always shown, power corrupts.
European society is made up of different nations which live in particular countries. Therefore, European Union institutions must answer to the citizens of every Member State, and the way to ensure continuous supervision of all authority entrusted to the European Union is to allow full access to documents. I am thinking primarily of working documents, analyses and consultations carried out by the European Commission or the Council. It is essential that the influence of interest groups on the development of regulations be recorded and open for everyone. It is important that not only Parliament have full access to these documents. The citizens of all Member States of the European Union should have the right of democratic supervision, so that it will be enjoyed by every interested organisation in society and every journalist. Only transparency can guarantee that the authorities and staff of the European Union will use the powers vested in them for the common good of the citizens of Member States.
Ladies and gentlemen, this debate hinges on a question of trust. The European institutions are always asking the citizens to trust them. During the Lisbon Treaty process, for better or for worse, they asked the citizens to trust them. The financial crisis started, and they asked the citizens to trust them. Well, trust is a two-way street, and you cannot always ask the citizens to trust you if, at the same time, you do not trust the citizens enough to show them all the processes and internal workings that drive the Commission. Those in power cannot complain that the citizens do not trust politicians if the politicians themselves do not then trust the citizens.
That is a problem of democracy; not only that, it is also a problem of waste. Society is itself a vast repository of knowledge that we will be wasting if we do not involve the citizens in the process of leadership and governance of the European Union. I have absolutely no qualms, then, in saying that I fully endorse the rapporteur's efforts, that he is doing democracy a good service, and that we should move forward not only towards transparency but, above all, towards ensuring that transparency is not just a fine word but means something concrete.
Beyond this, there is an important objective point which I remember from my time at Harvard University, and it is this: decisions that are made without transparency and no proper public scrutiny have a built-in tendency to be bad decisions. You should accept that one of the reasons that the Commission puts forward so many ill-considered, ill-thought out, inappropriate and ill-drafted proposals, which we in England and other countries have to put up with, is the lack of transparency. So in the matter of this legal framework I would urge the Commission to think again, if thinking again is ever actually a possibility for a flawed institution in a flawed system of governing.
Today, we are all agreed on the need for a factual adaptation of the 2001 regulation, yet the solution proposed by Mr Cashman does not seem plausible, insofar as it extends beyond every reasonable limit the possibility to acquire documents which could, in fact, sometimes go against the prevailing public interest. I would cite some examples: negotiations with third countries or other sensitive activities require a clear definition, a counterbalance between the legitimate right to transparency, disclosure and knowledge, and the denial of access to documents in accordance with the prevailing and recognised public interest.
We remain convinced of the need to promote the right of access to documents by natural and legal persons, in the knowledge that we must define a reasonable principle to balance conflicting needs: extending the role of the European Ombudsman, setting out precise and appropriate criteria for access and introducing transitional arrangements which will gradually lead to rules in line with citizens' needs, compatible with the proper functioning of the institutions. We are relying on the role of the current Presidency, the Spanish Presidency and the activities of the Commission to achieve this.
(NL) Mr President, which document are you looking for, exactly? What is the document number? These are just a couple of the responses citizens can expect when they put a question to the European institutions. Citizens want information, however, not promotional material or indecipherable policy documents, and so a drastic change of course is needed. The focus must be on citizens. This forms the basis of the questions by Mr Cashman, whom I should like to thank for his excellent and - I address this to Mrs Sommer, who has unfortunately left the Chamber already - extremely transparent cooperation in the last few months.
I should like to see part of the European information budget being spent on ensuring, via both digital information media and human contact, that citizens receive genuine, complete information and answers to questions such as 'Can you tell me the exact progress of the decisions taken by Europe on the European effort during the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference?' This is what citizens want to know, and so I call on the Commission, the Council and, in particular, MEPs, to support our initiatives towards greater transparency. This strikes me as the only truly clear message.
It is the case in Austria that a large proportion of people are dissatisfied with or sceptical about the European Union, because they have the feeling that there is no transparency and no access to policy. The processes for introducing and then pushing through the Treaty of Lisbon together with the election of the President of the European Council and of the High Representative have given citizens the feeling that they cannot see what is going on, that there is no transparency, and that they have no idea why these things have been done. I believe that if the Treaty of Lisbon is to be a success for the citizens of Europe, it is important that we should give people the feeling that they can identify who is making decisions within the Union and why and how they are being made.
Mrs Sommer is still in the Chamber and I thought it appropriate, even though she is not listening, to respond to what she said. She made a series of accusations. One that I had not been transparent. Can I correct the record and say that all political groups and all rapporteurs have been invited to all meetings. When they have not been able to be there, their positions have been faithfully represented to those meetings. All decisions subsequently taken have been communicated to all shadow rapporteurs and all political groups.
There has been a suggestion that somehow we should withdraw this motion for resolution that Mrs Sommer says is undemocratic and non-transparent - that her group knew nothing about this. Well, I find this interesting, when I have been negotiating this afternoon with her group, the EPP, on their draft motion for a resolution on the oral question. So I can only think that she is misinformed and, on that generous basis, I look forward to negotiating sincerely and in good faith with the EPP and with all other groups.
Pending this, there is much we can do. Both Mrs Wallström and Mrs Wallis referred to the meeting we had this morning, which represents a tangible way of promoting transparency and access to documents and of making our institutions more user-friendly. One of the things we discussed was how we can use our computer systems in such a way that citizens, journalists, NGOs and others can follow the progress of a piece of legislation from the Commission's proposal right up until it is finally voted through.
We also think, on the basis of a new treaty, that we can do it by expanding the scope of this regulation. That is the main difference, as we see it in the Commission. It will now cover all the bodies, agencies, etc. of the European Union. This is where we are today, so we still hope that Parliament will now provide, as soon as possible, a first reading. Then we can also have the views of the Council so that we can enter into proper discussions and negotiations and finally have a decision.
Regarding a number of very important issues that you have also raised, Mr Cashman, in your report: I think there are other means that we can use as they are a bit outside the scope of this regulation. But they are still very important initiatives. They have to do with registers, with things we discussed - today, for example - where we can improve openness and transparency through other methods and not only through the Regulation. This is where we will continue. I know you do not like it very much, but I have taken the initiative to make an openness action plan, parts of which we discussed today, where we can join hands and make efforts to continue on openness and transparency and fight for that.
Mr President, the problem of access to the documents of the bodies and institutions of the EU, which we are discussing today, is, in my opinion, extremely important in the European Union legislation process. Transparency, here, is essential, thanks to which every EU citizen has a right of access to documents, which, in the understanding of Article 15(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, includes not only parts of the prevailing legal order, but also drafts of legal acts. This means that every natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in the EU can have a direct influence on new legislation, and this constitutes a special form of public control. The currently prevailing Regulation No 1049/2001 ensures appropriate access to EU documents, but with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, we have been faced with an exceptional challenge, in which the role and real participation of EU citizens has increased. Unrestricted access to documents is, therefore, a significant determinant of the future form and function of the EU.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has affected the whole of Europe. It could be said that it has affected the whole world, but here in the European Union, it has probably particularly affected the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the new Member States, for a series of reasons. Firstly, because they are obviously more fragile economies than the more mature, industrialised and consolidated economies of Western Europe, and also because they are economies which do not have a financial system in which the crisis has been generated, and have therefore been dependent on a high proportion of direct investment from outside in order to finance their growth. When the crisis erupted, and particularly when the crisis worsened in 2008, this investment came to a halt, and left these economies in need of funding in order to finance their growth, which they were unable to substitute using their savings and internal resources.
The European Investment Bank has given specific priority to its financing operations in Central and Eastern European countries in a series of lines and activities. In order to do so, it has used instruments that the Bank had started before the crisis, like Jeremie, Jessica and Jaspers and other actions. Also, as it is not strictly a European Union institution, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has stepped up its action under the impetus of the European countries and the European Commission, who are shareholders in the bank.
As you already know, the balance of payments facility was an instrument that had not been used since 1993. This instrument is used to provide finance for countries with difficulties securing external finance, due to their balance of payments, or for countries with difficulties financing their budgetary needs. Its ceiling has increased from EUR 12 billion to EUR 50 billion, which was at the initiative of the Commission and agreed by the Council, and out of those EUR 50 billion, around EUR 15 billion has been used in financial support operations for three Central and Eastern European countries that are Members of the European Union: Hungary, Latvia and Romania.
The Vienna Initiative has meant that action could be coordinated, including maintaining the positions and risks taken by private banks in those countries. It has been possible to maintain a financial system at maximum level that helps to finance the consequences of the crisis and the investment needed to come out of the crisis. This is in the face of announcements of excessive risks taken by some Western European banks established in those countries. The truth is that so far, we have not had to mourn any 'victims' among those banks, but rather they have maintained a reasonable level of capitalisation and financial activity in the context of the difficult conditions that the system is operating under.
Finally, I would like to mention the importance of the euro as an anchor for the strategies for withstanding the blows of the crisis and emerging from it. The euro is a point of reference to guide the appropriate strategies for emerging from the crisis. There is a country in this region that joined the euro area in the middle of the crisis, Slovakia, and yesterday, the Slovakian authorities held a conference in Bratislava welcoming the way in which the euro has protected them from the worse consequences of the crisis and is helping them to get through it in much better conditions than they would have had to withstand if they did not belong to the euro area.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mr Almunia, in order to help the economies of the Member States in Central and Eastern Europe to recover, there are two possible approaches: giving fish or giving a fishing-rod. Of course, what is best is to give a fishing-rod. The difficulty is to know what kind of fishing-rod it should really be. The cornerstone and gauge of recovery is the creation of new jobs. In order for this to happen, investment is needed. One of the main obstacles to investment in the region is a lack of clarity about the stability of the national exchange rate and the introduction of the euro. At the moment, the introduction of the euro in the new Member States is like a horse-race, with each state trying to break away from the pack and reach the euro area.
It may happen that in this crisis situation, some Member States do themselves harm; for instance, by rapidly reducing budget expenditure, they increase unemployment over the level that their economies can withstand. It may also happen that one Member State, in joining the euro area, may damage the economy of a neighbouring state outside the euro area, by attracting investment to itself and increasing the level of unemployment in the neighbouring state. The European Union is formed on the basis of the solidarity principle. When the EU increased the number of its Member States in 2004, a unified strategy for the reception of these Member States into Europe was developed and adopted. I believe that the European Commission should have a rethink on the process of introducing the euro and should prepare a clear strategy for its introduction which does not indirectly induce Member States to cause harm to themselves or their neighbours. It is not necessary to change the stability criteria, but a joint plan and timetable should be developed for the whole region, so that we can introduce a single currency in Europe using an established procedure that is clear to all. This would be the fishing-rod that would help the economies of that region to recover, by opening the door to investment and the creation of new jobs.
These are countries which joined the Union only recently and which are outside the euro area. It is therefore important to remember them and identify the most effective actions so that they can be part of Europe as a whole and subsequently participate in life in Europe on an equal footing with others. There accordingly need to be monetary policy interventions, starting with those of the European Central Bank, since unless we help increase their GDP and invest in their production systems, they will not be able to redress the imbalances that are currently weighing them down, satisfy the Maastricht criteria and join the euro area. It is also important, as you mentioned, for there to be other actions such as easier access to the resources provided by the European funds and EIB financing.
I believe, however, that we should never forget that these actions must be carried out within a framework of simultaneous actions for other weak countries in Europe too. It is not just a question of the countries that we are discussing today, as we are all unfortunately aware, and for all these reasons, we can no longer delay the creation of a European financing system capable of supporting investment with a comprehensive vision for Europe. I am referring to the establishment of a fund financed by Eurobonds, which I believe to be the only practical solution available to Member States and the European Union.
Many problems that today affect the majority of the Baltic States, for example - you mentioned Poland, but I could, of course, mention Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary - are due to the fact that they are not in the euro area. Therefore, they must continue to use their local currency, and this is giving rise to harmful, devastating consequences at present. We may well talk of an economic recovery, but in those countries, there is no economic recovery for the time being. In some of these countries, the unemployment rate is over 20%, and public sector salaries have had to be cut by more than 20%. The figures relating to their economic growth are really very negative.
The important thing is that we allow them to join the euro area as soon as possible. However, at present, they are suffering the harmful effects of this situation. Clearly, the idea is not to change the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact - no one has asked for that. They should not be changed because, as you rightly said, the euro area has acted as a defence against the economic and financial crisis. All the same, we must help these countries in a different way, not by changing the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, but by offsetting the negative effect that they are suffering because they are outside the system. If we do not do so, it will be several more years before they join the euro area.
We have made a number of suggestions, we have drawn up a six-point plan and asked the European Commission to take it into account. We therefore need the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to cooperate with one another. Which measures must be implemented in this context? Firstly, the Central Bank must also provide liquidity to local banks. It has granted liquidity to banks in Western Europe; it has also indirectly provided resources to Swedish banks, for example, but some local banks have received nothing from the European Central Bank.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I come from Latvia, a country hit heavily by the financial crisis. Due to the irresponsible policy of right-wing governments, Latvia risked going bankrupt without financial assistance from outside. Now we are speaking about different financial and economic solutions which could change the situation for the better. Of course, we must properly discuss all the solutions, including the speedy introduction of the euro. In the meantime, I am afraid that the financial and economic perspective is only one side of the coin. We have to discuss the social perspective as well.
Do I believe that Latvia and other countries of the region urgently need the EU's helping hand? Yes, I do. But I strongly believe that we need a strong mechanism for control and we need very strict conditions in the field of social policy. EU money should first of all go to save common people, not banks or state bureaucracy. Therefore, using this opportunity, I would ask all my colleagues and fellow Members to sign Written Declaration 0056/2009, which was initiated by representatives of three political groups, on social conditionality for European Union help.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you, Mr Verhofstadt, for tabling the question. However, the posing of the question during this evening's debate may confuse European Union citizens in Western Europe. 'Look, we have to suffer from the financial crisis too, because Eastern and Central Europe, through its clumsy governance, has created these problems for itself and also for us'. Such a view debases the already seriously impaired confidence in the European Union's cohesion policy. The example of the Baltic States, however, shows that we are in the same boat. The pursuit by the Scandinavian banking sector of market share and high profits in practice squeezed national currencies in the Baltic States out of the loans market, particularly the home mortgage loans market. With a fixed national exchange rate, the civil liability of borrowers towards lenders was very high: all the currency risk in the value of an overpriced pledge was borne by borrowers.
In late 2008, in tense talks between the Latvian Government, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the Swedish Government, a decision was taken to buy up the second largest commercial bank, using only Latvian taxpayers' money, and to keep the national exchange rate strong. Thus, we Latvians, having over many years lost our revenue, competitiveness and, possibly, quality of society, saved the banking sector of the Scandinavians and other investors, at least in the Baltic States, since the domino effect in the event of banks failing would go far beyond Latvia's borders and would reach as far, let us say, as Scandinavian pension funds, as the banks' shareholders. Yes, the European Commission helped us, and the International Monetary Fund financed this choice, but the lion's share of the loan goes to stabilise the banking sector.
By not allowing a default and by retaining a strong exchange rate, we devalued our economy by 20% of GDP, but in reality, we were helping the neighbouring Estonians, whose advantage, of course, was having had a responsible budget balance for many years, to introduce the euro as early as 2011. It appears even more odd that for Europe's monetary union, an example like Estonia is even crucially necessary. This, as it were, shows that the Maastricht criteria for the introduction of the euro work even in times of crisis. It is not that we are not pleased for the Estonians, but our sacrifice, in buying the bank, was a certain measure of solidarity in not foisting off misfortune upon our neighbours and aggressive investors, too. We only wanted to see a certain solidarity from European financial policy makers, including on the subject of the barrier to new euro area states.
Politicians in Latvia had to take extremely harsh decisions, which the majority of my fellow Members in the older European countries would not have to deal with even in their most terrible nightmares. However, it is not within our power to take away the currency risk of private debt from our citizens, and we do not want to behave like hooligans by unilaterally introducing the euro or allowing the euro to circulate in tandem with our national currency. However, the goal of our demographically ageing society cannot be to spend many years exchanging every second lat earned into euros to pay back the banks, while in the evenings, offering up prayers that the lat will hold fast against the euro.
Thank you, Mr President, in my view, on the issue of the modernisation of social policy and assistance to the states of Central and Eastern Europe, there is a lot of rhetoric, but not much actually happening. A new social policy has not been fully worked into the macro-economics of the European Union. The budget is small, and is not keeping pace with the enlargement of the European Union. Striving to extend its area of influence, the European Union often helps countries outside the EU more than the new EU states. Therefore, it is no accident that in Latvia, for example, the majority of inhabitants are today worse off than before accession to the European Union. More than 90% of pensioners are surviving on income which is below subsistence level.
Unemployment in Latvia has reached the 20% mark, gross domestic product has fallen by 19%, the State debt exceeds the annual budget, and pensions have fallen by 10%. The people are protesting, leaving Latvia, announcing indefinite hunger strikes or offering to sell their internal organs in order to get money to keep their families. The number of suicides is rising. The European Union's neoliberal social security policy must be changed. Capitalism caused the crisis, but it is workers and pensioners who are paying to find a way out of it. Investment by the major capitalist multinational companies and banks in solving the problems caused by the crisis is minimal. The European Union is allowing the upper classes and the banks to be saved with the tax revenue of the state, that is to say, with the people's money.
The countries of Eastern Europe want an equal allocation of subsidies to agriculture, since at the moment, subsidies are more concentrated towards the older Member States, which, at the same time, distorts the free market in labour. There must be an end to the unequal approach in the calculation and payment of direct payments, and to the separation of these payments from the manufacture of specific products. The European Commission and Parliament must democratically adopt regulations to protect not only the interests of large producers and bankers but also the needy in the rich, democratic European Union.
The economic and financial crisis has had a much harsher effect on the transforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe than on the stable democracies of Western Europe. It is therefore right to look for ways to counter this unfavourable economic development. We must not forget, however that miracles happen only in fairy tales. Therefore, the primary and fundamental requirement in terms of changes for the better is a responsible financial and economic policy of the government and a modern, right-wing working legislature in every affected country. Only then will it be possible through targeted industrial measures to play a part in gradually assisting economic development.
(HU) First and foremost, we should find a solution to avoiding a similar crisis in the future. The mess caused by the global financial system is sweeping across the world, having a direct impact on the real economy because companies have no access to credit, which is the vital lifeblood of the economy. The lesson from this is obvious. It is clear that we must get rid of the belief placed in the market's self-regulation and supremacy, and accept and enforce the state's regulatory role.
We talk about economic recovery, but obviously, the ultimate aim we want to achieve through this is to protect jobs. This means that priority is given to support for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe as well, as they actually provide the majority of jobs. The terms for gaining access to credit are a fundamental issue. Certainly, the banks have operated sensibly, as we heard from Mr Almunia. This applies to Hungary as well, for instance, where all the commercial banks are subsidiaries of foreign owned banks. Therefore, because of their prudence, they have tried to withhold credit in such a way that it has also paralysed the domestic economy.
Direct subsidies, which the EU also allows, are also obviously required, but they should not be given to those governments, like the current Hungarian Government, which primarily supports the settlement of multinational firms rather than small and medium-sized enterprises. Today, we discussed the matter of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development when dealing with the modification to the European Commission's 2009 Finance Bill. In its draft, the Commission has taken the significant and drastic measure of holding back these funds, even though they are precisely earmarked for maintaining the rural population.
Why are we talking about this region separately? The reason is that it has become much more vulnerable than the western part of Europe. We need to go back in time to the 1990s, when it became clear that our hope - that our economy in Hungary would also become independent in this democracy - was in vain. This region suffered from the ever-increasing burden of the instalment repayments covering the inherited debts, as well as the using up of its cheap natural and human resources, while all these generated very significant financial revenue in the Western countries. This is why I feel obliged to say now, with proper justification, that this region should receive more support, as this is a matter of obtaining partial compensation.
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has demonstrated that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe outside the euro area are much more vulnerable than those where the single currency is used. As a result of their dependence on strong exports and foreign capital, as well as the population's high level of foreign currency debt, the rate of recovery is also slower than in those countries enjoying the security of the euro area. If the solidarity between Member States does not work in practice, rather than just as a sound bite in slogans, the European Union's internal cohesion will diminish, thereby hampering the whole EU's performance.
However, we do not need any new EU instruments to achieve this solidarity, especially not handouts. The existing opportunities and resources must be used sensibly. In this respect, the European Central Bank can help in constantly maintaining the liquidity of the banks in the region. The European Investment Bank can also help by providing targeted credit to the region's small and medium-sized enterprises, while the EU's institutions can help by adapting the rules for using the money from the Cohesion and Structural Funds to suit the extreme situation. I would particularly like to draw your attention to the fact that many people like to treat Central and Eastern European countries en masse, even though these countries are very diverse, with different crisis exit strategies as well.
For instance, after nearly eight years of incompetent socialist administration, Hungary has used up all its reserves. At the moment, it is forced to exercise restraint, which is in stark contrast to the practical actions adopted in other European countries for managing the crisis, based on economic recovery. While the Western European governments are already thinking about drawing up their exit strategies, some countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have been worst affected by the crisis are still facing major recession in 2010 as well. Therefore, when it comes to devising exit strategies, it is vitally important to have some way of differentiating between countries.
EU leaders should not devise standard rules which would only exacerbate further the situation of some countries and that of their population. When drawing up the new financial system regulations, attention must be focused on ensuring that the tightening of capital requirements does not generate unfair competition between banks. The banks in Central and Eastern Europe which have turned out to be healthy have not received any injection of capital from anyone. This means that they would only find it more difficult to deal with the stricter capital requirement regulations than their rescued counterparts in Western Europe. This would result in a decline in their desire for credit, which was not very great anyway, with small and medium-sized enterprises ultimately ending up the victims of this situation. We must avoid this scenario at all costs.
(ET) Mr President, first I would like to congratulate Mr Almunia sincerely for his very effective work up to this point. For all the Member States of the European Union, there are many common problems and, at the same time, each country has its own economic policy and its own specific problems, and we must definitely all be self-critical here. The argument that only the new Member States of the European Union have been especially severely affected by the crisis is not true. Look at the countries where the banks have needed economic support - they are mainly the old Member States, not the new ones. Similarly, fiscal problems are bigger in the euro area than outside it.
The Commissioner mentioned Estonia. I come from Estonia, and it has not been an easy job to fulfil our aspirations of joining the euro area, but the one thing I think we might share with the other countries around is self-responsibility. I have not heard the word 'self-responsibility' in this assembly in this debate so far; there is only the word 'solidarity'. How can we expect solidarity if we have big world competitors like China and India racing ahead? I think in the European Union we should be much more pragmatic and think what our national governments are responsible for.
According to an analysis carried out by the National Bank of Poland, the dynamics of the recession in nine countries of Central and Eastern Europe were definitely stronger than in the countries of Western Europe. What is worse, the differences between the individual countries of our region are greater than those in the 'old' EU. This is partly a result, not only of the greater stability of the economies of the old 15, but also, and let us say this directly, of their greater ability to use or bend certain financial instruments which theoretically have been banned by the European Union.
The Commissioner spoke about the salutary role of the euro, but it was surely a joke. Poland does not have the euro, and the crisis has affected us to a lesser degree than Slovakia, which has adopted the euro and where the consequences of the crisis are more serious than in Poland. I appeal for solidarity, of which the representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) spoke, but I have the impression that he is, on this matter, a hypocrite. In this context, hypocrisy is not a tribute to virtue.
Mr President, I expected Commissioner Almunia and indeed Mr Verhofstadt to perhaps offer us an explanation, and an analysis, for the reasons behind the disaster which has befallen most countries in Central and Eastern Europe in the economic arena. Twenty years ago, we had an heroic movement of working people in those countries which brought down the Stalinist monolith. Unfortunately, instead of replacing that monolith by going on to genuine democratic socialism, it was the restoration of capitalism which followed. But that was what was prescribed by the entire political European capitalist establishment: the EU, the big business media all promised that capitalism would herald a bright new era for the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.
The market was to be God; competition was to be king. So we have the imposition of the neoliberal agenda so beloved of the European Commissioner: the wholesale privatisation of public property - the robbery of public property, in fact - and putting the economies of these countries at the mercy of the sharks on the international financial markets. We even set up a special bank to oversee this process, and it has been an unmitigated disaster. The Baltic States are in freefall: Latvia 18% down in the third quarter, unemployment at 20%.
The policies of the EU establishment mean a nightmare for the ordinary people of these countries - the threat of barbaric conditions for the ordinary people. So I would commend the people of Central and Eastern Europe to reject this fatal prescription of the European Union establishment, nationalise their banks, put them under democratic control so that they invest for people and for jobs, nationalise or renationalise the major sectors of the economy, but this time under the control of working people so that they can plan their economy for people and not have themselves at the mercy of the sharks, of corporate Europe and financial Europe, which has brought about this dreadful disaster for the peoples of this region. You may laugh, Commissioner, but I await your response.
Without forgetting about Member States' own responsibility, as my fellow Member said, the new Member States are facing general difficulties which definitely seem like objective difficulties to us. One such difficulty is the enforced procedure for the twenty-year accession process, which caused serious economic problems for these countries and expected genuine social solidarity from their inhabitants. Another one is these countries' lack of the defence mechanism offered by the euro area, which meant that they were in a much more defenceless position when the crisis hit them. Lastly, there is the proportion of SMEs and the people employed by them in these countries, compared to the figures for the European Union.
All in all, I firmly believe that, in order to achieve economic recovery in the countries of the European Union and Central and Eastern Europe, we must join forces and tackle a threefold objective involving employment, financial balance and economic growth. I believe that the small and medium-sized enterprises package contained some of these elements. At any rate, we ought to overcome somehow the financial difficulties of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector. We would definitely need the European Central Bank's assistance mechanisms to achieve this. The smaller an enterprise is, the more difficult the access the EU has to it.
(ET) Mr President, above all, I would like to draw your attention to the three Baltic States, whose situation is perhaps the most serious of all in this region. Here are some examples. Estonia's economic output has fallen by over 15%, while the European Union average is -4.1%. In no other European country apart from the three Baltic States has there been a drop in economic output of more than 10%. In all three Baltic States, unemployment has risen up till now to more than 15%.
I very much hope that the proposals by the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to revive the economy and to improve the financial situation will receive very concrete attention and a response from the Commission. Last year, Estonia had to cut the budget three times and shrink public sector expenses, and further cuts will aggravate the already serious social situation. I very much hope that Estonia will join the euro area on 1 January 2011, in order to create an area for economic growth and for the resolution of financial difficulties.
(RO) According to the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union's economy is a social market economy. Our main concern must be to create new jobs, reduce unemployment and emerge from the economic crisis. Member States in South-Eastern Europe are faced with huge deficits. They must stimulate the creation of new jobs, while maintaining a long-term, sustainable fiscal policy. Education, health, agriculture and development of the transport and energy infrastructure remain the main priorities for these Member States. It is important for the level of agricultural subsidies in these Member States to be on a par with those in older Member States. Assistance offered by the EU over a period of five years for balance of payments can be granted if the beneficiary Member States commit to reforming their system of taxes and duties or if they adopt measures to boost their administrative capacity in order to increase and achieve maximum absorption of European funds. These Member States also need to be supported in modernising their heavily polluting industrial sectors in order to reduce emissions, but preserve jobs and ensure economic development. I would like to add as a final point that I believe that support for these Member States requires the cohesion policy for the 2014-2020 period to continue to help Europe's regions which are less well developed economically.
(PT) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the promoters of this debate, because it really is very important that we discuss the situation of economically weaker countries and countries outside the euro area. That is particularly so at a time when we are discussing strategies for coming out of the crisis, when we will have to bear in mind the different situations the various countries are facing. The situation is difficult in many economies in Eastern and Central Europe, but things are now starting to become difficult in many economies in the western part that are inside the euro area. My country, Portugal, is an example. The strategy must take account of the various situations, which differ from one country to another.
Several different paths can be taken. It is extremely important to have a suitable monetary and budgetary policy, if possible, one that is increasingly determined by political criteria that take into account the need for liquidity for companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, that do not create or perpetuate obstacles that are very difficult for countries outside the euro area to overcome, and that exert pressure on national governments to carry out the medium- and long-term reforms that are needed. To conclude, we have to move on from words to deeds. Cohesion has to be effective.
As a result, the International Monetary Fund postponed delivering to us the third tranche of a loan amounting to EUR 1.5 billion. However, the Swiss Government decided to grant us a non-refundable loan amounting to approximately EUR 120 million. My country has recorded 8% negative economic growth and an unemployment level two points below the European Union average. In the future, the EU requires a strategy focused on getting governments to step back from supporting their national economies. However, this will not be possible in Romania until 2010 as we are not allowed to do so by the agreement signed with the IMF.
(RO) I agree with the proverb that if you are coming from a fishing trip and you meet someone on the way, you should teach them to fish instead of giving them a fish. However, we have to know that we need to teach them to fish. I am referring on this point to the states which have recently joined the EU and still need to learn. However, they cannot learn off their own bat. We also need to give them the financial resources to do so. I personally believe that a healthy economy is mainly made up of medium-sized enterprises. As a result, economic, social and territorial cohesion policies must be targeted primarily at allocating European cohesion funds for this type of economy. I would like to add that the EU's economic, social and territorial cohesion policy has been neglected recently in terms of defining the European Union's priorities.
Returning to more serious matters, the economic contraction in the countries of Central Europe has reached drastic proportions. The disparities are growing between these countries and the rich countries of Western Europe. Furthermore, these countries' capacities to generate economic and financial incentives remains at such a low level that it is almost negligible. I want to draw the European Commission's attention to the fact that, as a result of the social costs, the considerable rise in unemployment and swingeing budget cuts, these countries' capacities to provide cofinancing for projects with European funding is also diminished. All these factors may condemn the countries of Central Europe...
(HU) Mr President, influenza strikes down those who have a weak constitution. Therefore, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe not only need a 'vaccination', but also something to fortify their constitution. You know what I am referring to here. The change of regime should be supported, not only the economy, although that should, of course, be supported too. The reason is that, in a large number of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the economy, media and politics are still in the hands today of those who systematically ruined this region over the last 40 years.
Allow me to begin with a phrase used by Mr Verhofstadt. He said that the fact that there are countries in Central and Eastern Europe that are not part of the euro area means that there is a 'rideau de fer' (an iron curtain). I do not agree, because some of the Central and Eastern European countries that are not yet in the euro are in extraordinarily difficult economic situations, but there are others whose economic situations are no more difficult than those of more mature, more advanced economies. The latter have belonged to the European Union for much longer, have been receiving finance from the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds for much longer and are in the euro area, and they have equally serious or sometimes more serious problems than many of the economies of Central and Eastern Europe.
With the greatest respect, the problem is not how the criteria for entering the euro are interpreted, and we have debated this many times in this House. That is not the problem. There has been criticism in this House of those who, at the time, decided to allow some current members of the euro area to join it when it was not very clear whether the conditions had been fulfilled. What we are now seeing is that the economies that are not well prepared to deal with a crisis such as this are suffering the most, both within and outside the euro area. This is the problem that we should be concerned with.
Do we need to cooperate more? Of course we do. Do we need to strengthen the European instruments? Of course we do. The Commission is asking the Council and Parliament to do so. Parliament is also asking the Commission to do so, and what I am asking Parliament is to ask the Council to do so, because the Commission's proposal for the actions of the European Social Fund in 2009 and 2010 to be 100% funded by European resources in those countries that benefit from the European Social Fund has not been accepted by the Council. I would be very grateful if you could say this to the Council.
However, to think that by using European instruments, it is possible to avoid having to make difficult adjustments in order to deal with the consequences of a recession such as this shows a lack of awareness of the depth of the recession that we have suffered, both within and outside the euro area, in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in Western Europe. It has been of such depth that we can imagine how, for example, Ireland has made such extremely difficult adjustments, not because the International Money Fund says so, or because it has been imposed by anyone from Brussels, but because the Irish authorities consider it to be the best way to adjust its economy as soon as possible and move forward with the same impetus that it had before the crisis.
The social consequences of these adjustments concern us and concern me personally, just as much or even more than they concern Parliament. I can tell you, as it is public knowledge, that by using the balance of payments facility, the Commission has reduced many of the adjustments proposed by the governments of the countries benefiting from those resources. We are going to continue to do this. We have also tried, as far as possible, to preserve the amounts in the national budgets in order to be able to jointly finance the European funds, because otherwise, the reductions in investment expenditure that would have to be used to jointly finance European funds would have had very negative consequences in those countries.
Firstly, in the light of our experience of this crisis, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need a much more balanced model for growth. They cannot depend solely and exclusively on finance from foreign investment. Many of you have talked about small and medium-sized enterprises, and I agree with you. They also cannot depend solely and exclusively, or almost exclusively, on foreign banks, because when it comes to supervising the actions of the financial system, it is very difficult to have supervisory authorities and a financial policy that serves the interests of each country if practically all the banks are not from that country and take strategic decisions based on the interests of their country of origin. Having said that, it must be said that the foreign banks in those countries are conducting themselves extraordinarily well, as I have already said.
Finally the consequences of the crisis are being felt more, in social terms, in the countries that do not have a sufficient social protection system or welfare state. This is the case partly because they do not have a sufficient level of growth, income or wealth, but it is partly the case because, it has to be said, during the years prior to the crisis, in some of those countries, there was a 'less is more' tax policy, and when money is needed to fund public action there is none, because there is no income. This is also something to consider for the future.
At a time when the global economic crisis is continuing to affect Europe, the states of Central and Eastern Europe are feeling its effects more intensely due to the existing disparities in economic development between the old Member States and those which have joined during the last accession rounds. The economic crisis magnifies these disparities, placing additional pressures on the governments in these countries, which have to deal with stringent macroeconomic conditions, the social repercussions of the crisis, while also having to resolve problems arising from the vulnerability of the financial system and the sustainability of the public health care and social insurance systems. Taking into account these economic and social policy constraints, I hope that the Commission will adopt an integrated plan focusing on the specific problems in this region. It must be a plan which supports the efforts made by these states to maintain an economic and social balance. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have taken up loans granted by the IMF, the World Bank and the European Union in an attempt to overcome their domestic problems. However, the financial resources are not supplied at the rate required to support the measures adopted by these governments. For this reason, I call for these resources to be made available more quickly and for a plan to be adopted which will support the economies in this region.
Romania and Bulgaria are feeling the full impact of the global economic recession which has hit the last two countries to join the European Union, against the background of a disparity with the developed economies of the other Member States. The latest Eurobarometer survey highlights that the populations of both countries state that they are very greatly concerned about their countries' economic path of development, as well as about the way in which the crisis is affecting every citizen personally. On top of the conclusions of the Eurobarometer survey, the crisis's impact, in the middle of winter, is only going to get worse. National governments have the duty to adopt the best measures to enable them to get through the winter without any drastic social consequences. The International Monetary Fund and the European Commission have been involved in helping Romania and Bulgaria, both financially and through providing expertise, by setting certain macroeconomic indicators. Greater involvement by the European Commission in stabilising the Romanian and Bulgarian economies will have a beneficial impact across the whole of the European Union, which cannot afford any major imbalances at the moment. All of the European Union's Member States are being affected by the different aspects of the crisis. However, it is evident that the new Member States are going through more difficult times than the well-tuned economies of the old Member States. Solidarity is one of the European Union's fundamental values, and an economic recession is a good time to show it.
At the start of the year, we were pleased to note that more than EUR 3 billion were earmarked for energy improvements as part of the economic stimulus package introduced at that time. The European Commission rightly acknowledged that support was required for both the creation of alternative supply routes and the interconnection of energy networks. However, our delight is mixed with a degree of disappointment. If we look at the specific support sums, we can see that the support package neglects Central and Eastern Europe, the very region which is most vulnerable in terms of energy supply. The Franco-Belgian gas interconnection receives more support than the Central and Eastern European interconnections. While the Franco-Belgian interconnection will be the seventh, joining the existing six, this kind of infrastructure is very often lacking in the new Member States. In addition to this matter, we were also unhappy that the energy efficiency improvements were completely left out of the support package. However, this was precisely the area where the package's main aim could have been easiest to achieve, namely, job creation. Due to the shortcomings mentioned, we believe that two things are of paramount importance. Firstly, future support plans must focus on those regions where energy investments have the greatest added value. Secondly, energy efficiency, which is frequently mentioned in EU circles, cannot be forgotten when budget decisions are being made in the future, especially if we know that a more efficient use of energy can already produce absolutely spectacular results in the short term.
in writing. - I congratulate the Commission for the efforts they have made to help European economies. The knowledge that the EU provides measures for those most in need reaffirms and ensures that we will all come out of this economic crisis stronger than before. I would like to emphasise the importance of losing all currently existing barriers on economy, trade and free movement on the labour market. Completing the integration of the European single market must be the main target in the short term. Only this helps us effectively stand against any future crisis. One of the strongest incentives the EU has is being part of the euro area. The euro is an important incentive for investments and economic growth, reducing vulnerability. I truly hope that my own country, Estonia, will succeed in fulfilling the criteria necessary for joining the euro area. Estonia has one of the lowest foreign debts in Europe and has managed to put aside enough reserves during economic growth to be able now to face the crisis with its own means. Furthermore, I am convinced that the current means from European funds and the prospects for joining the euro area soon will allow us to reduce unemployment efficiently next year.
Ladies and gentlemen, over a year after the greatest shock to American society since 9/11, the declaration of bankruptcy by the Lehman Brothers Bank, we are wiser as the result of further experience. What has happened in the last 12 months is clear proof of the erroneous assumptions of neoliberal politics and, as was the case with 9/11, has persuaded us to look at the world in a different way. The economic crisis has affected basically every part of the world, but, most importantly for me, it has affected many millions of Europeans. The report published by the World Bank several days ago does not leave any doubt that the EU Member States in Eastern Europe need aid, and not only in the area of their internal affairs. If the crisis can reduce 11 million inhabitants of Eastern Europe and Central Asia to poverty, with a further 23 million set to follow suit by the end of 2010, under no circumstances can we be complacent. Financial support is essential, but so is intellectual support, to establish suitable social programmes for the countries which are feeling the effects of the crisis the most. During previous crises, families were able to save themselves by emigrating or by holding down several jobs. Today's crisis has a global dimension, which renders this type of solution impossible. If we do not want to see more effects of the events of a year ago, we should mobilise significantly more European funds, make it our aim to promote employment and strengthen international cooperation. All of these actions should focus on one thing - social policy.
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have felt the effects of the economic crisis exceptionally hard. Falling economic indicators were a reality of the last year in many countries, and not only in our region. However, it should be stressed that different countries coped with the crisis with differing degrees of success. The clear leader of countries in the region with favourable results is Poland. As Mr Almunia admitted during the debate, Poland is the only country to have avoided a recession, maintaining a positive growth dynamic throughout the crisis. Despite the fact that the economic situation in the region is slowly stabilising, it is worth thinking about what measures should be taken to restore economic growth and avoid similar turbulence in the future. In the short term, the governments of the countries concerned should adopt more resolute strategies of escape from the crisis. They need to balance budget expenditures, actively fight unemployment and social exclusion, and create conditions for the development of businesses, on the one hand, and conditions for an increase in demand, on the other. Equally as important as action at national level is external help. European and international financial institutions should establish a special credit line for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the support of infrastructure projects. These measures would certainly bring a growth in employment and an improvement in the social situation. In the long term, the best solution seems to be entry to the euro area and creating the conditions for balanced and stable growth.
During the past year, the battle against the crisis was waged primarily at Member State level, using Member State instruments. The EU's Member States considered taking action mainly at national rather than EU level when it came to economic recovery, providing assistance to companies and preserving jobs. In some cases, even the minimum expected level of coordination, agreement and cooperation was lacking. The old Member States, with their stronger economies and more room for manoeuvre in budgetary terms, put together packages which primarily focused on their domestic markets and, in many instances, protectionist instruments that distort competition were used. One glaring example of this was the support offered by France's President Nicolas Sarkozy to the Peugeot company, stipulating as a condition the retention of jobs in France, while redundancies had to be made at the company's more efficient plant in Slovenia.
Similar discrimination can be encountered in connection with the financial sector in Central Europe and the Baltic region, as Western parent companies continue to this day to divert profits generated at their subsidiaries operating in the region. The credit crunch is having a particularly tough impact on the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which provides the majority of jobs and is sacking employees in huge numbers as a result of the contraction of export markets and reduction in development opportunities. This means that the economic crisis is inevitably turning into an employment and social crisis. For this reason, I am asking the EU15 governments once again to do their utmost to block protectionist measures and take a stance against the behaviour of the domestic banks, which is infringing internal market principles.
in writing. - (HU) The global economic crisis has had a varying effect on the European Union's different Member States. The new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe have proven to be the most vulnerable. The reality of the situation has shown that Member States have had unequal access to the instruments contained in the European Economic Recovery Plan. We have also noticed that Member States in the euro area have enjoyed the best protection against the crisis. It is no coincidence that the consequences of the crisis were felt harder in those countries which did not have the benefit of recovery instruments and were not members of the euro area. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has marked the end of the European Union's period of institutional reform.
Now a joint effort is required to strengthen the European Union's cohesion. This is a vital condition for the EU to emerge from the crisis revitalised, as a crucial global player. The impact of the social and employment crisis will be felt most in 2010. The new Member States will definitely be its main victims. What we need is an economic recovery plan that is, in actual fact, equally accessible to all Member States. In addition, the terms for joining the euro area must be made more flexible. These obvious measures will contribute to creating a strong Europe, making it a community of half a billion citizens who profess the same values and are guided by the same ideas.
It is important for us to be aware that the hygiene regulations have undergone a paradigm shift. We have strengthened the internal market, we have improved food safety and we have increased the responsibility of food producers and suppliers. This is a significant change and therefore we have, of course, identified a few problems, in particular in relation to the licensing of small and medium-sized enterprises. Some butchers' shops have ceased trading. We should once again review the situation, as this is due to the fact that very often, the flexibility built into the regulations is not being made use of and there has been no exchange of information between the local supervisory authorities and the European Food and Veterinary Office, which I feel is a very bad thing.
If the Commission now decides that it does not want to make any changes, I will be forced to object. I believe that it is necessary, even if these are only cosmetic changes, that we should look in particular at the following issues. We should be aware that the information within the food supply chain is being interpreted too narrowly and this needs to change. We should consider whether other methods for inspecting meat would be appropriate. In particular, we should not continue with the accreditation of trichina laboratories described in Regulation (EC) No 882. We need reliable planning for the areas which apply regulations. This is specifically why I am opposed to the intended regulation. We should be making a brief and concise proposal for changes so that we are not involved in authorising transitional rules until 2013.
Turning to specific issues, firstly, I am aware of the problem of the reapproval of small capacity establishments. Solutions to such problems can be found through the flexibility provisions in the regulations to be adopted at national level. Where this approach has not been followed, difficulties have arisen in certain Member States. The Food and Veterinary Office is currently carrying out specific missions to identify best practice of such flexibility for small capacity slaughterhouses, with a view to their wider dissemination. Due to the fact that Member States have until the end of this year to decide whether to grant or refuse approvals, I cannot say at this stage how many small and medium-sized enterprises were refused approval.
The Commission's consultation shows that good progress has been made and that overall, the application of the regulations is functioning effectively. The fear that excessively strict regulations would result in small and artisan companies going bankrupt has, in most cases, not become reality as a result of the exceptions for small companies. However, the consultation also clearly shows that there are problems in applying the rules in many cases. This is confirmed by the information that I have received from companies and supervisory authorities in the region which I come from.
As a result of the fact that the authorities in the regions have a great deal of leeway in their decision making, they can meet the needs of smaller and artisan butchers' shops in individual cases. This is definitely a good thing, as it is the only way in which we can ensure that smaller butchers, which offer a wide variety of products, with the accompanying challenges for freshness and quality, are not crushed under the weight of excessive bureaucracy. However, this flexibility does have its limits when it results in exceptions and regulations being interpreted differently according to the whims of the supervisory authorities.
The innovative character of the regulations was the reason why an initial report on the experiences with the regulations was planned only three years after they came into force. The Member States and the food suppliers and producers were generally happy with the regulations and have reported making good progress in applying them. In the opinion of the Member States and the private interest groups, there are no major difficulties either for the companies or for the authorities. They are unanimously of the view that these regulations need some adjustments, but that a fundamental review is not required. The challenge of ensuring that consumers receive the highest possible quality and safety with regard to product hygiene and of responding flexibly to the needs of the companies and, in particular, very small companies, is met by the current regulations.
In line with the saying 'If you stop improving, you stop being good', the problems identified in the process of drawing up the report, as Mr Schnellhardt has already mentioned, will have to be investigated in order to determine the cause and, if necessary, solutions will have to be found. It is, of course, also necessary to continue to follow closely the implementation of the hygiene package, as it was too early for some Member States to provide a balanced and detailed evaluation. Only when we have a comprehensive assessment in front of us should we decide whether changes should be made to the food hygiene regulations and, if so, which changes those should be.
I therefore think that it is worth pointing out that as the Spanish Presidency is coming up in the next six-month period, and as the determination of the Spanish Government and Spanish society to fight all forms of terrorism is so consistent and persistent, it will certainly be an opportunity to include this harmonisation, this framework programme for the protection of the rights of victims of terrorism in the action plan. As it is a plan for multiannual legislation, it is going to be the responsibility of the Spanish Government to draw it up, which will have to be supported subsequently by the Belgian and Hungarian presidencies in defining the legislation and implementing the objectives of the Stockholm Programme.
Madam President, I would like to say that this initiative is in line with the amendment tabled by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and myself to the Stockholm Programme, because it was not included in it. The victims of all types of terrorism needed it, and what is more, they are asking us for it. I have learned a great deal about dignity, public spiritedness and suffering from the victims that I have worked with in recent years. Their testimonies drive me to advocate a European standard of looking after the victims of terrorism from a material, emotional and legal point of view.
In Europe, murder has been committed in the name of religion, Marxism, private property, environmentalism, the independence of a region or the unity of the State of which it is a part. There have even been governments implicated in terrorist actions. This is not, however, a question of principles. Totalitarians and fanatics kill, the perversion of the basic values of humanity kills. These are the things that lead to violence, but the free exchange of democratic ideas does not. I dedicate this speech to all the victims of terrorism.
(ES) Madam President, Mr Barrot, it is no coincidence that a whole series of Spanish MEPs have spoken. In the Basque Country, in addition to the suffering caused by a terrorist attack, victims have frequently suffered contempt or silence after the event. This is why a movement has been forming seeking the recognition of victims, which I think requires a policy for the victims of terrorism. If I may, I would like to add to what has been said by all my fellow Members in favour of a charter or of a common approach to this policy by giving you a very brief summary of ten aspects that I feel are key in this respect.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to voice my support for Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio's proposal for a European charter on the rights of families who are victims of terrorism, and stress that this constitutes an extraordinary opportunity for Europe to send an unambiguous message on terrorism, bearing in mind that the lack of this message led to the breakdown of the Barcelona Process in 2005 when the Heads of State or Government of the Euro-Mediterranean countries failed to reach an agreement. I would also stress that today this offers an extraordinary opportunity to renew dialogue on a new footing with the other side of the Mediterranean, starting with a clear statement on the concept that is the cornerstone of our humanity and our civilisation, namely the sanctity of life.
I would like to add to the remarks made by Mr Jáuregui Atondo. On the one hand, we definitely need the victims' charter and the support for victims of terrorism. However, at the same time, we need as an accompanying measure to change the environment in which the violence occurs that leads to terrorism. In my opinion, we need to start with education and information. In addition, this House must clearly reject the brutalisation of language. We are constantly calling for tolerance in many areas. However, in one area, we must show no tolerance and that is with regard to violence.
On the basis of this study, we are going to see how we can harmonise and bring together all the measures so as to improve the situation of victims of terrorism in Europe. This will be the aim of the action plan, and there is no doubt that we will deal with this problem of victim protection by taking account of what has been said during the debate, namely the need to try, first of all, to make people aware of the tragedy and the suffering of victims, who are often the subject of silence, if not contempt.
the oral question to the Commission (B7-0239/2009) by Antonio Cancian, Mario Mauro, Fiorello Provera, Elisabetta Gardini, Salvatore Iacolino, Crescenzio Rivellini, Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris, Aldo Patriciello, Paolo Bartolozzi, Cristiana Muscardini, Mara Bizzotto, Barbara Matera, Lara Comi, Antonello Antinoro, Lorenzo Fontana, Roberta Angelilli, Amalia Sartori, Iva Zanicchi, Licia Ronzulli, Giovanni Collino, Marco Scurria, Giancarlo Scotta', Potito Salatto, Pablo Arias Echeverría, Raffaele Baldassarre, Pilar Ayuso, Luis de Grandes Pascual, Pilar del Castillo Vera, Santiago Fisas Ayxela, Carmen Fraga Estévez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, Esther Herranz García, Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo, Veronica Lope Fontagné, Antonio López-Istúriz White, Gabriel Mato Adrover, Jaime Mayor Oreja, Pablo Zalba Bidegain, Salvatore Tatarella, Magdi Cristiano Allam, Mirosław Piotrowski and Konrad Szymański, on the display of religious and cultural symbols in public places.
I will start with a general remark: obviously nobody - let us look first at the substance of this ruling - could consider the removal of someone and something which was already there to be an act of democracy and freedom, as some have claimed, but rather an action of the thought police, an anti-democratic act. If a crucifix is hanging on a school wall and it is torn down, that wall is not a secular wall but an empty wall, with the void intended as a confessional symbol, an act of negative education, the worst kind imaginable, which can be viewed as one of the many signs of the cultural and spiritual suicide of the West.
The ruling of the Strasbourg Court presupposes a concept of religious freedom which, if taken to its logical conclusion, would go so far as to ensure, to impose a sense of predominance over each citizen, required to live in an environment in keeping with the Court's beliefs. I do not believe that this is religious freedom: this distorts the true sense of religious freedom; we are dealing with a negative right, or rather the right to be free of the obligation to perform religious practices. There must be no misunderstandings when we speak of religious freedom: we are not talking about something vague by any means.
We are dealing with something quite different here: displaying a crucifix is not just a matter of faith in our culture, but something much more important, something with a universal value. The symbol of the cross, the symbolism of the cross conveys a message that is universal in scope; a message, moreover, of peace and fraternity, as taught to us by René Guénon, the great metaphysicist, to mention just one name. From the traditional point of view of these great scholars of traditional culture, this value is extremely clear but, at the same time, it is just as clear that with this ruling, we are dealing with the expression of anti-traditional views which encourage everyone to think in the same way. This is something that runs counter to the true spirit of the European Union, and this is what is astonishing.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 November 2009, the European Court of Human Rights approved an application from an Italo-Finnish citizen seeking to remove crucifixes from classrooms. Similar episodes had occurred in the past in Spain, Germany, France and also in Italy where, in 1988, the Council of State established that the crucifix is not just a Christian symbol but that it also has a value unrelated to that specific religion. The Italian Council of State, expressing its opinion again in 2006, specified that the principle of secularity of the state cannot disregard a people's cultural identity and its civilisation.
I am obliged to adhere to a number of rules of law. The Commission is very committed to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as laid down in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. However, it is true that the Commission can act only within the context of applying EU law. The fact is, within the EU, national laws on religious symbols in public buildings come under the domestic legal system of the Member States.
The principle of subsidiarity is to be applied within the context of the Union. It is true that this principle of subsidiarity does not apply to the implementation of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, the international court in charge of enforcing the European Convention on Human Rights. It is true that the responsibility for implementing European Court of Human Rights judgments lies with the Council of Europe. It is also true that the implementation of European Court of Human Rights judgments is mandatory for all States that are party to the European Convention on Human Rights, and Italy, like any other party involved in this case, has the right, under Article 43 of the Convention, to request a transfer of proceedings to the Grand Chamber within three months of the date of the judgment. According to the information we have - the information we have read in the press - the Italian State is using its right to appeal before the Grand Chamber.
It is precisely for this reason that I will explain my thinking by means of a paradox: what would happen if we applied the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, that is, if, at the same time, we applied the reasoning which obliges us to remove crucifixes from Italian classrooms to all places where crosses are displayed on the grounds of public interest? What should be done about this flag, the flag of Sweden, and what should be done about this flag, the flag of Finland, and the flag of the Slovak Republic, and the flag of Malta, and the flag of Denmark, and the flag of Greece, and the flag of the United Kingdom which has three crosses, no less?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the somewhat misleading title of today's debate includes the word 'subsidiarity'. Subsidiarity, as I understand it, means taking decisions at the level closest to the citizen, and that level is the citizen - the individual citizen. What you are saying in your resolutions is that the rights of a national state are above the rights of individual citizens. It is our job in this House to protect the rights of citizens, not the rights of states.
Secondly, I think - and this has been said by Mr López before - politicians have no business interfering in Court rulings. Let the judges do their jobs. We may have an opinion - we may like the ruling or we may not like it - but we should not interfere in their work. My group, the ALDE Group - the European Liberals - is the champion of a Europe that is for all citizens. ALDE believes in a Europe of diversity, where everybody has the right to their own conscience, their own religion and even the freedom from religion.
Madam President, in view of the historical fact that the founding fathers of the European Union were Christian Democrats: Konrad Adenauer, Alcide De Gasperi, Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet, who based what they built on Christian values and symbols, I will remind you that the flag adopted by the European Union, which shows a circle of 12 gold stars on a blue background, and which is hanging behind you, Madam President, refers to the 12 stars upon the head of the Holy Virgin Mary - the Revelation of St John, chapter 12.
Over half a century on, it is worth asking if the philosophy of the founding fathers is still relevant. In the context of the scandalous judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which ordered crosses to be removed from an Italian school, it should be stated emphatically that no group of judges appointed by politicians, not even the Council of Europe, can order the removal of a cross, which has universal and religious significance. This verdict tramples underfoot freedom of religion and the cultural heritage of Europe.
The relationship between church and state in Europe has always been disputed and has led to bloody conflicts. It is right and proper that the European Union has managed to separate the state from religion. This is a good thing. However, we have a wide range of different models in Europe. France is clearly a non-religious state, while in Great Britain, the Head of State, the Queen, is also the head of the church. We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed. For this reason, I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way.
I would even like to take things a step further. I do not want to talk about subsidiarity, but about the basic issue that, from my perspective, the European values of solidarity, subsidiarity and freedom are unthinkable without a foundation in Christianity and in the Judaeo-Christian understanding of religion. Why do we not find these values in China or in the Middle East? This is because they are based on our culture and our religions. It is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith. We are proud of our religious freedom.
There is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist. That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this. However, there is also the right to have a faith. In my region, where more than one million people live, over 80% are Catholics. Just as atheists call for others to show them tolerance, so the Catholics who make up more than 80% of the population are calling for non-believers to be tolerant of their faith. They want to be able to show their faith in public, to represent it and to have Christian symbols accepted by the minority in this majority society. This is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom.
The decision is simple, clear and universally comprehensible. This is why it has evoked such fury and aggression among the clergy and Right-wing politicians. They pretend they do not understand, and demand explanations from the Commission and that Parliament adopt an official position. This is unlawful. EU institutions are not empowered to evaluate that judgment, or indeed any other. Let us not forget that there is a tri-partite division of power, and that the Court is a body of the Council of Europe, and not of the European Union.
I will answer the questioners, since they have such doubts: the judgment about crosses does not violate the principle of subsidiarity. Quite the opposite, it gives help in observing the law to those European states which have forgotten that in their constitution, there is a provision, if not about the division of church and state, then at least about neutrality of worldview. The judgment of the Court helps national authorities and courts which are subject to the church to realise the fundamental rights of citizens which are being broken as a result of the clericalisation of social life. The citizens of church states cannot defend their rights before national courts. It is a good thing that they can turn to the Court of Human Rights and obtain justice.
It is not interference in church-state relations, but only defence of citizens whose rights are being violated. In my country, too, advancing clericalisation is restricting the fundamental rights of Poles. I cannot imagine that the European Parliament and the Commission would prevent my fellow Poles from pursuing their just rights before the Court in Strasbourg. A critical position of the Commission and Parliament concerning this judgment would be unauthorised interference, and would, in addition, expose us to ridicule. I must warn you of this.
Furthermore, the question also rightly concerns the relationship between subsidiarity and human rights, and I note that the latter, aside from certain fundamental principles which must be considered universal and irrefutable, may be interpreted in different ways, and human rights may even conflict with each other. Why should a state be denied the chance, through its laws, to resolve these conflicts and to interpret and implement human rights according to the ethical views of its people? The issue therefore goes beyond the question of crucifixes.
Therefore, we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the Court. It would be a serious matter if a supranational power, especially if exercised by a limited number of people and not as the democratic expression of popular will, were to become repressive and demeaning, insensitive to people's feelings and hearts and therefore ultimately opposed to freedom. This is why I hope that the resolution tabled by the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will be adopted with the votes of a large number of Members.
Fundamental rights in the EU are today guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms but, above all, they arise from constitutional traditions common to the Member States which have developed over centuries. I therefore believe that the EU must fully respect national history, culture and traditions and resolutely refuse to penalise Member States who defend their right to their own special make-up and character, including the Christian heritage and Christian symbols. In conclusion, I would merely like to add that neither the Charter nor the European Convention enlarge the powers of the Union.
(EL) Madam President, I, too, consider that the Court is wrong to find that having a crucifix in schoolrooms is tantamount to disrespect for other people's religious faith. The issue we are debating today is a social rather than a legal issue. Obviously we must abide by the principle of subsidiarity. The presence of religious symbols is not a sign of religious discrimination or coercion. It is a result of the tradition and history of every country and often of its Constitution, as is the case in my country, Greece.
Within the European Parliament, there are 23 official languages which demonstrate that there is nothing that unites Europe if not Christianity. I would like to ask Mr Barrot a question: why, after a popular referendum in Switzerland said 'no' to minarets, did the European Commission, the European Union, the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference all rally round to condemn the outcome of that referendum - even though Switzerland is not a member of the European Union - yet today, you are taking a neutral position over a question which concerns our roots, our identity and our soul?
(HU) As a Protestant clergyman, whose tradition regards the eight-pointed star and not the cross as the most important symbol, allow me to make a brief contribution to this debate. I am actually from an electoral constituency where 99% of the electorate are Catholic. My four children go to school with Catholic children. The cross does not bother us. I would like to make a distinction here - if I may, on a technical point - between the crucifix and the cross. We must be aware, even though it does not bother me personally, that there are people who are bothered by the cross or crucifix because the cross or crucifix reminds them of the Inquisition.
I feel that this is appropriate in those countries where the practice has developed because of the Catholic tradition of having a cross in schools, especially in faith schools. However, Parliament should not be discussing these matters, but rather poverty, the economic crisis or how Eastern Europe is going to catch up. This is an unproductive debate we are having. We need to look at who it was who protested in that Italian school and why. We should have examined this one-off case rather than discuss a matter here which is already something from the past.
Equality laws have failed to protect Christians - indeed, quite the opposite. An amendment to the Equality Bill to protect the religious liberty of churches was voted down in the House of Commons two weeks ago, amid accusations of interference from the EU Commission. The Commission, in their reasoned opinion, argued that the UK needs to narrow the religious liberty safeguard in its employment laws. I say: shame on the Commission. There must be a recognition that people have faith and have the right to express that faith. Christians ought to be protected, and not punished, by the law.
That being said, I am a lawyer and, quite honestly, I do not see how this debate can be held here, when it should have been held first at the Assembly of the Council of Europe and in our national parliaments. That is where I believe this debate should really take place. Moreover, we are obliged - I am obliged, on behalf of the Commission - to say that the Commission is certainly very committed to respect for the principle of religious freedom and that it would obviously be compelled to react against any form of discrimination against persons belonging to a particular religion.
Having said that, the Commission may not act outside the legal framework laid down by the treaties. Moreover, it may not intervene as guardian of the treaties on issues concerning a Member State when those issues do not relate to European Union law. I am obliged to say this, quite simply. The Commission can only note the various positions that have been expressed in this House, but it cannot express an opinion on an issue that does not come under European law. Once again, these issues come under the domestic legal system of the Member States. That is what I can say for my part, as a lawyer.
Nonetheless, I believe that this debate is useful and that it was interesting, of course, even though I would quite simply encourage all those who have taken part in this debate to keep a necessary sense of proportion and to allow the Council of Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in turn to usefully debate the interpretations that could be given to a European Declaration of Human Rights. Quite honestly, however, as guardians of the treaties we cannot intervene in a debate that essentially concerns the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights.
in writing. - (DE) The ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is the expression of an aggressive secularism and gives authority to those who want the public domain to be religion-free. In so doing, they are overlooking the fact that our continent cannot exist without Christianity. Christianity has defined Europe, its people, culture and art and its way of thinking to the extent that the continent would lose its identity if all traces of Christianity were to be removed. It is certainly not about calling into question the freedom of religion. The separation of the Church and the State is a supreme benefit of our democracy and I would like us to take care to ensure that both carry out their own tasks with mutual respect for one another. However, this respect is exactly what it is all about. The Christian Church must not demand that everyone subscribe to its beliefs, but it is entitled to demand to be respected by everyone.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what does freedom of religion actually mean? The answer is quite simple. It is the freedom to practise religion. Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion but the freedom to have religion. Freedom of religion does not create a religion-free society, but rather gives people the right to practice their religion openly within society. A crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe, or not to believe. Therefore, it does not violate the freedom of religion. Nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols. If this were the case, we would, in fact, immediately have to prohibit all crosses on gravestones and all church spires. The crucifix ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is therefore not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity, but it also violates the right to religious freedom itself. We, the European Parliament, cannot and must not accept this ruling. The European Court of Human Rights should administer justice and not become a puppet for ideological and anti-Christian interests. Otherwise, we will have to seriously consider whether this Court actually still has a purpose at all.
In my opinion, the ruling of the Court has nothing to do with protecting freedom of religion. The presence of a cross in a classroom does not, on its own, exert pressure on a person's worldview and does not violate the right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own convictions, just as that right is not violated by wearing clothes which testify to the profession of a particular faith. A mutual understanding and openness to others lies at the foundation of a common, united Europe, as does respect for cultural differences between countries and the roots and traditions of the nations which make up the European Union. It is no secret that the sources of our European identity derive directly from the Christian tradition. Therefore, for a clear majority of Europeans, a cross is a religious symbol and, at the same time, a symbol which represents their values. I do not imagine that the mutual dialogue which we conduct with each other every day should be devoid of the values which we hold. Neither do I imagine that, in the name of religious freedom, we should be forced to deny what is, for us, an important and sacred symbol, irrespective of whether it be a cross, a Star of David or a crescent moon. Just as no one has the right to force anyone to adhere to a particular religion or value system, so also no one has the right to compel, in the name of freedom, anyone to remove symbols which are important for the whole of humanity. By its ruling, the Court of Human Rights is not, in fact, upholding religious freedom, but is discriminating against all those in whose lives symbols of faith have significant meaning.
Mr President, at the beginning of this week's part-session, you answered a question from my Austrian colleague, Jörg Leichtfried, on the new Members joining this Parliament as a result of the Lisbon Treaty and when that could take place. You answered that this is now up to the Council. I agree as regards them joining this Parliament as full Members, but I am not sure that this is the case when it comes to their status as observers as an introduction to actually becoming full Members.
As I said before, I have asked about the decision of the European Council, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should also take into account and study the problem. There is no final decision yet about the number of new seats and from which country they should come. There is no final decision. I know it is the decision of the European Parliament, but it is not final, so it is not so easy to take observers without having the final decision about the number and from which country they should come. So we must wait. I am thinking about that and taking care about that very strongly.
An interinstitutional agreement must be made. The European Commission is also involved in this. It is too early to discuss this. It is very important that we maintain an appropriate balance between the current presidency and Head of Government, and the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy. Our presidencies change, while the President remains the same, but we also need to cooperate with the Heads of Government. We need cooperation with governments, because as a legislative body, we must have permanent contact with the government of the country which has the presidency.
Furthermore, the way in which we are going to work together, and whom we invite, is also our decision - in consultation with the European Council, of course. We are going to hold talks about this. I would like to tell you that it is far too early to be doing this. Meanwhile, Mr Reinfeldt is giving the report of the last six months' activity of the European Council. Mr Van Rompuy was not involved in this work, because he was nominated only a few weeks ago, so he could not discuss this matter at all today. The matter is absolutely clear.
As we speak, representatives from 193 countries are gathered in a conference centre in Copenhagen, talking, arguing, negotiating and trying to meet the expectations of millions of people around the world. In just two days, the UN climate conference will be over. Soon we will be looking back at a meeting that was crucial, not only for the EU but for the world; a meeting that was decisive for those who cannot grow their crops because of a lack of water, decisive for those who have lost their homes in tornadoes or floods, and decisive for those who are vainly building walls against a sea level that rises every year.
The fight against climate change has been at the top of the agenda throughout the Swedish Presidency, at all our European Council meetings and in all our summits with the Union's major partners. As you probably know, we adopted a comprehensive mandate at our October European Council to keep the EU's leading position in the climate negotiations. We agreed on a long-term goal for emissions reductions of 80-95% by 2050 and we renewed our offer to reduce emissions - 30%, provided that others make comparable efforts. We agreed on emission reductions for international transport and, despite resistance from some corners, we put figures on the global financial need in developing countries to fight climate change. Last week - after weeks of bilateral consultations - we took yet another step: a collectively put-together financial package earmarked for the 'fast start' of climate action in developing countries, offering EUR 7.2 billion for the coming three years.
I have sat down with the Indian and Chinese leadership. I know what they say about this. Why should they agree to develop clean and green, when we have polluted the world for decades? That is one way of looking at it, but the problem is this: the developed world cannot solve the problem alone. Emissions from the developing world are already starting to exceed those from the developed world. That is why we must work together to solve the problem. From our side, we can compensate for years of irresponsible behaviour. We can help finance climate action in the developing world. The European Union took its responsibility last week. It is not the form that matters in Copenhagen but the substance. We can be satisfied if we get a deal on emissions reductions and on financing, and a commitment to start immediate action and, more importantly, we can start fighting climate change.
Last year, we were suddenly faced with the most serious financial crisis since the 1930s. The ground was literally shaking under our feet. Suddenly it became clear to us how interlinked the financial markets were and how interdependent we all were in finding a common response. In the course of only a few months, governments in the EU adopted extraordinary support measures. It was a fast and impressive response but it came with a price. Our aggregated deficit in public finances now amounts to almost 7% of GDP - over three times more than last year. Twenty Member States are experiencing excessive deficit procedures. So the follow-up to the economic and financial crisis has, quite naturally, been another main priority throughout this autumn.
But then the unexpected happened. At a late stage, the Czech President came with new conditions before he would sign. We had to handle these requests in a way that did not trigger similar conditions from other Member States and we managed to do this at the European Council in October. A few days later, the Czech President signed. Immediately after the signature, I started to consult my colleagues again. We had to agree on high-ranking positions - on the President of the European Council, and to nominate the High Representative. I am not exaggerating when I say it was a relief when all preparations were finalised on 1 December. The Treaty of Lisbon could finally enter into force.
President of the Commission. - Mr President, Prime Minister, during the past six months, we have seen a new treaty come into force, ending almost a decade of debate and opening the door to new opportunities for this new, enlarged European Union we have today. We have seen the first evidence that decisive action taken to stabilise the European economy in the face of crisis is bearing some results. And as we enter the end game in Copenhagen, we can be clear that the European Union has been working hard to maintain the momentum it has championed towards decisive global action on climate change.
I would therefore like to pay a very sincere tribute to Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and all the team of the Swedish Presidency for a highly successful presidency. It is particularly important that the Swedish Presidency has been so effective in ensuring the completion of the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty, managing the transition to this new treaty while achieving all the other objectives. We have seen the appointment of the first President of the European Council and of the first High Representative, the Vice-President of the Commission, by the European Council. And let us not forget - because it was a very important moment for this Parliament, following the unanimous designation by the European Council - we have seen the election by this Parliament of the President of the next Commission with a qualified majority.
Last week's European Council was the first time that it has met as a fully fledged institution. It was also the first time that the new High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Catherine Ashton, has attended. The new President of the European Council will be fully functioning by 1 January 2010 and has presented his ideas on how to organise the European Council in the future. I very much welcome all the proposals to give the European Council more consistency and more continuity in its work. I also welcome the ideas of having more political, frank discussions and short and punchy conclusions.
On the economy, we are keeping the right balance between maintaining the stimulus and preparing our exit strategies. I presented the scene for our European 2020 Strategy. I hope the European Council will focus on the discussion of this very important agenda for the future of Europe, namely through discussions in the next meetings, in the formal European Council in February and in the spring European Council. I would like to reiterate here my offer to come to this plenary so that Parliament can organise a specific debate on this very important issue. I think it is extremely important that there is full ownership by the European Parliament and, on the side of the Council, by the European Council, of this European Union 2020 Strategy, which is where our future will be played.
On the Stockholm Programme, the Commission's proposals have now been translated into an agreed approach for the next five years. I know that many in this Parliament share our determination to use this springboard to seize the opportunities of the Lisbon Treaty for a step change in European action on freedom, security and justice. That was one of the major reasons why I decided to reorganise the portfolios of the next College in this area. It is going to be one of the most important areas of the European Union's work in the next five years.
Let us be frank about this. Some of our partners are announcing their intentions by press statements; but we have announced our intentions by law, law that is already agreed by all the Member States. The developed world must act, but it must also help the developing world to decouple growth and emissions. I think that it is right that the European Council last week centred on how we can put this global leadership at the service of an ambitious deal at Copenhagen: by promising help to developing countries not in some distant future but already next year; by making clear that the deal must be comprehensive and must have the verification mechanisms to make it stick; by maintaining our readiness to up our targets, but only if others put ambitious commitments on the table as well.
I think the European Council achieved very important results, namely on two matters. First, on finance, the Council was able successfully to put together a fast-start finance package, bigger than expected and, critically, with every Member State involved. Of course, some have said that this is not enough coming from the European Union, but EUR 7.2 billion, more than USD 10 billion in the current circumstances, and for three years, is a very serious commitment. I hope the money is now guaranteed, not just an aspiration. It is now for others to match it. The European Council also reiterated its commitment for medium-term financing, to ensure it gives the fair contribution that is necessary for 2020.
We know that the atmosphere at the moment is not easy at Copenhagen. We also know that this is part of the usual rhythm of a top negotiation. However, the arrival of so many Heads of State or Government will be a powerful driver to reach a deal. If that deal includes real commitment to cut emissions from both developed and developing countries; a clear commitment on financing to make this happen; and an agreement on how this is to be applied and verified - if this agreement includes the different elements of the Bali road map and can be seen to be in the right ball park to respect the 2 °C limit, then I think we will say rightly that it will be a major achievement. We are not there yet, but I believe it is possible to reach that agreement.
The next few days will show whether the ambitions we have discussed in this Parliament so often are going to be realised, but I sense already that there is a compelling need for change and that we need to make this success in Copenhagen. There is a huge amount at stake. There is, of course, a balance to be found, but there is also a sense that today's generation knows that there is a challenge which cannot be avoided. I believe last week's European Council left the European Union ready to meet the challenge. I hope that with European leadership, we will achieve success at Copenhagen.
Indeed, my group supports the honest and responsible management of European affairs, which has been the hallmark of the Swedish Presidency. Honest management, because, at a time when so many of our friends, neighbours and relatives are being hit by the crisis because they have lost their jobs or their jobs are still under threat, Europe has not made false promises to them. It is building the future, our future, by making sure that businesses once again have the means to create, to innovate and thus to create jobs.
Let us be careful, however, not to repeat the mistakes of the Lisbon Strategy which, by setting unrealistic goals, has been more disappointing than anything else. Let us be careful to ensure that the new economic strategy, dubbed 'European Union 2020', does not become yet another complicated beast. Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, on climate change, too, Europe is showing a sense of responsibility. With its decision to release EUR 2.4 billion in aid each year for three years, Europe is setting an example by providing a third of the international aid earmarked for the poorest countries.
To conclude, the PPE Group supports the Council's guidelines on security under the new Stockholm Programme. Our fellow citizens want more security, but also respect for public freedoms. They want to be protected in their daily lives, they want to know what they are eating and what they are consuming but, at the same time, they expect - and this is only natural - to live in a fairer society that is more respectful of others. This is precisely the kind of Europe that we, the PPE Group, defend and promote.
I wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for its efforts and, above all, now that Christmas is here, Mr Reinfeldt. You have worked hard over the last six months; it was not easy, as we all know. I also wish the best of luck to Mr Van Rompuy, who will take over for two and a half years, and I ask the Council not to forget that, from now on, the Council and Parliament are playing in the same league under somewhat more transparent circumstances.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concept of transition has been mentioned several times today and I believe that it an appropriate term to describe the Swedish Presidency. It was a presidency of transition from one treaty, the Treaty of Nice, which had proved to be totally impracticable, to the Treaty of Lisbon, which is overloaded with expectations, not all of which, in my opinion, can be met, as the Treaty of Lisbon cannot be the end of institutional development in Europe. In this regard, we must be careful not to expect the Treaty of Lisbon to fulfil all of our wishes for all solutions to all of the problems of the world, because we can see how difficult it is to work with the Treaty of Lisbon by all the points of order that have been raised.
I would like to begin with the institutional problems that this treaty has created. We still have the Swedish Prime Minister here today. Who will represent the Council Presidency next time? Mr Van Rompuy, the rotating Council Presidency, then the President of the Commission, then Baroness Ashton - if they all speak then at least, for the first time, for the first four speeches we will not have this permanent PPE conference, and we will then have Baroness Ashton and hence a proper socialist, who will stir things up. That is definitely one benefit.
The Swedish Presidency was a presidency of transition, but also a presidency that once again had to experience Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy playing their cards very close to their chests to the very end, letting the current Presidency run its course - while the public said 'it does not know what is going on, it cannot do anything' - and has to pay the price for their tactical game. That has been the fate of Mr Reinfeldt over the last few months. Thank goodness, that has now come to an end. That is the progress we have made with the Treaty of Lisbon: a bit more transparency in our institutional structures. And surely something else, too: the enhancement of the power of the European Parliament. However, more power for the European Parliament also means that the other institutions will have to deal with Parliament. For the President of the European Council, this means that he will have to coordinate decisions that he wishes to prepare in the Council - legislative decisions at least - with Parliament. He would be wise not to view the President of the European Parliament as a spectator at the Council meetings, but as the representative of an institution that has been given greater power. That is what I expect from Mr Van Rompuy, for example.
The Council, and the Commission, too, would be well advised to try to seek a majority in Parliament, on the basis of this new treaty, that will also be able to meet the social, environmental and finance policy challenges that they themselves formulate in their programmes because, for legislation, they ultimately need a qualified majority in this Parliament if they want to push through their initiatives. Therefore, the Commission would be well advised to seek a majority throughout the whole breadth of Parliament, which is perhaps something that does not go well with the fact that Members of the Commission are deputy leaders of European parties and are therefore evidence of the one-sidedness of certain political trends. That is something, Mr Barroso, that you need to think very seriously about.
The Swedish Presidency has put in a lot of effort. I will gladly admit that here. However, ultimately - and this is not your fault, Mr Reinfeldt, but the fault of the system - it has had no influence on the big decisions, including those that are currently being made in Copenhagen, because a single rotating presidency cannot influence very much at all, it can only coordinate, and there is a difference between coordinating and influencing. Influencing the supervision of the financial markets, climate change, the efforts for economic recovery - these are things that only Europe as a whole can do, with its institutions in collaboration. I therefore believe that the Treaty of Lisbon represents progress. The fact that the Swedish Presidency ultimately put it in place seems to me to have been the big success of this transition Presidency.
Mr President, firstly, I will not be talking this morning about institutional matters, as others before me have done. We will certainly have time to discuss these matters, since the Council is apparently going to implement a protocol that requires an intergovernmental conference. We must think about whether or not we want a conference. I believe that we in the European Parliament will nonetheless have a few ideas on this subject to ensure that we make progress with European democracy and that we compensate for the lack of transparency and democracy in the cooptations being proposed.
That being said, I should especially like to thank the Presidency, Prime Minister Reinfeldt and Mrs Malmström for the excellent relations they have maintained with Parliament and for their fine management of what were, after all, very difficult issues - I am, of course, talking about the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. We even had to overcome the 'Klaus obstacle'; from now on, we will talk about the Klaus obstacle and the excellent way in which the Swedish Presidency solved that problem.
If, in the next two days, these three reach an initial agreement, then we will have a serious basis on which to convince the others - India, Brazil and the other countries - to join in this effort. I therefore call for a proactive approach. The most important thing is to strive for this three-way alliance, which is necessary in order to reach an agreement, and to propose, from the outset, a 30% reduction in emissions. A sense of purpose must be shown in this proposal.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, after having spent four days in Copenhagen, I find it extremely difficult to listen to the words 'leading role of the European Union'. Leadership - and I learnt this back in nursery school - is primarily achieved by setting a good example. I would now like to ask you, Mr Reinfeldt and Mr Barroso, whether you actually believe that, with a strategy based on lies, self-deception and large-scale international deception, we can achieve a leading role in an international process such as that in Copenhagen.
You should know, Mr Reinfeldt - and Mr Barroso certainly knows this because he has been involved long enough - that the two-degree goal is a 'mission impossible' if the Europeans stick with the offers that they have so far brought to the table. The reduction target is inadequate. At the same time, we Europeans have opened all the back doors in order to avoid a reduction policy at home. There are no limits to off-setting any more. Hot air has become the order of the day not only for Poland, but for Sweden, too. The inclusion of forests, which you and your government in particular have been promoting, Mr Reinfeldt, is another contribution from Europe to avoiding having an active reduction policy.
Mr Reinfeldt, you do, of course, deserve our thanks. As has been said, the Swedish Presidency came at a difficult period of transition and turbulence associated with adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. That is behind us now, but the presidency also came at a time of economic crisis. I would like to begin my speech, which is not going to be all complimentary, by thanking you that the Swedish Presidency avoided the temptation of populism, so easy to fall into, in these difficult times of crisis.
Mr Reinfeldt, you have proved there are no easy answers to difficult questions. The Swedish Presidency has shown that in times of crisis, the European Union is able to look for good and non-populist solutions which can help not only Europe, but the whole world, to get out of this difficult situation. I would like to thank you very sincerely for doing that difficult work, for your respect for the Member States, and also for the respect you have shown for the European Parliament. It was a difficult time, and I think you have passed the exam here. You will be able to end your mission in two weeks' time with complete satisfaction.
Firstly, what I think was a completely unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article about Israeli soldiers in a Swedish newspaper, and the whole unnecessary aggravation of relations between the Swedish Presidency and Israel cast a shadow over the last six months. I want to say it was wrong that the presidency did not unequivocally condemn the article in the Swedish paper. I and my entire group think Israeli soldiers are not only defending Israel, but the whole of our civilisation. I think the last six months have been lacking in unequivocal support for our main ally in the Middle East, Israel. Evidence of this is the outcome of the last European Council concerning the Middle East, which, although it is, in my opinion, better than what was proposed, does not give us a leading role in the Middle East. The European Union should be leading the peace process, and should be the main force striving for peace in the Middle East. If we want to play this role, we must overcome our own differences. We cannot adopt unilateral pro-Palestinian positions. The last six months of foreign policy have, unfortunately, not put a stop to this.
We spoke about this yesterday during the debate on Georgia. I think that rising Russian imperialism is one of the European Union's most serious problems. It is dangerous not only for Russia's neighbours, but for the entire European Union. Nevertheless, I would like to thank you, Mr Reinfeldt, for your leadership and for the Swedish leadership of the European Union. The role of Parliament is to draw attention to that which is not always, in our opinion, the best. I think that, on balance, in spite of the negative comments I have made, the Swedish Presidency has been a positive one.
Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Svensson, will speak on the subject of the Swedish Presidency. I would like to highlight two points from the conclusions of the first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, I regret the fact that the European Council did not communicate any clear messages with regard to the future strategy of the EU. On the contrary, it fell into line with the old Commission, which wanted to hold on to the basic principles of the failed Lisbon strategy.
My second point is that we on the Left in the European Parliament welcome the fact that the Council is finally fulfilling the request for a capital transfer tax. In yesterday's debate, we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future. We will continue to bring this subject up and we remain of the opinion that the European Union can and must take the first step in cases of doubt. Waiting for someone else at a global level to take this role away from us is not something we can continue to do.
We are still awaiting a clear signal that we will see the introduction of a European legal system against this type of organised crime, which is so very powerful in several countries - if not in all the countries of the European Union. Since this type of crime can operate too freely, it has taken advantage of our freedoms, moving as it pleases between financial marketplaces, tax havens and markets dealing in property and other assets. It is precisely on this point that we could have done with a much greater degree of clarity, a more clear-cut line of action by the Swedish Presidency. We accuse the Swedish Presidency openly.
And then we come to the statements of certain representatives of this Presidency on another important and symbolic question, that of the Swiss referendum on minarets. The Swedish Foreign Ministry defined a 'no' to the building of minarets as the 'expression of a prejudice'. It went even further, claiming that Berne's very decision to hold a referendum on a matter like this was questionable. So here we have a question that lies outside the scope of the referendum, and that is the question of whether or not to hold a referendum.
(NL) Thankfully, this weak Swedish Presidency has come to an end, as not much good has come out of Sweden. There has been no tough line on Turkey, which continues to occupy Cyprus illegally. Sweden has left Israel in the lurch, and its proposal to divide Jerusalem illustrates its naivety about the objectionable, barbarous ideology that is Islam. Sweden would have done better to strongly support the holding of European referendums in all Member States, as Switzerland did on the minaret ban. That is what the European public wants.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I have two brief remarks to make. Firstly I would like to thank Members for their kind words - also other words, but mainly kind words and kind comments. We now have a new European Union based on the Lisbon Treaty, and I could say, being involved in the rotating presidency, that, to make this Europe work for the future, it will be a combination of taking responsibility on the part of Member States, the Commission and this Parliament. It will be very difficult, without full responsibility taken by all these parties, to get this work on track.
My second comment concerns Copenhagen. I frequently hear this: Europe is not leading, and in my country the opposition says that Sweden is not leading: it is the will to bash on ourselves. Then show me who the leader is. I would like to know that, because it would be perfect to see that leader and to follow their initiatives. I have not seen that yet. We are committing ourselves to reductions, legally based, earlier on the table, with concrete financing that I have not seen from other parts of the developing world.
Also, when it comes to Copenhagen, I think it is very important to remember that we need to keep the 2 °C target. I am not sure that we will be able to deliver that. I know that Europe has done its part and is ready to move to 30%, but we cannot solve the problem alone. We only stand for 13% of global emissions. If this is to be a global answer, it must be a global response, and then we also need the other major emitters to make bigger commitments.
A few words on Sweden, since that was mentioned. I think it is very important, after making these kinds of commitments - whether it is Kyoto or now an agreement in Copenhagen - to go home and do your job. We updated just yesterday the reduction of emissions that has been done in Sweden since 1990. We are now down to -12%. We are following how this is internationally respected, the way it is presented. We could always say that that is the wrong way of dealing with it, but that is the global agreement the world has. Concerning that, we have presented these kinds of figures.
President of the Commission. - Mr President, just two remarks: the first on Copenhagen, and the other on the successful Swedish Presidency. First of all, regarding Copenhagen, I am also very surprised when I see many European colleagues with a self-defeating rhetoric. In fact, if there is a field where we can be proud of the leadership role of the European Union, it is precisely on climate change. Show me one relevant player or a group of countries that have committed as far as we have been committing ourselves.
As I said earlier, some others have announced their intentions through press statements. The European Union has announced its intentions through legislation which is already binding: legislation which originated from the European Commission, which received the support of the European Council and of this Parliament, and - unilaterally and unconditionally - the European Union has already put the reduction of greenhouse gases at 20% by 2020. No other player has done anything comparable so far. So let us ask others to do something similar to our effort.
Is this enough to reach the 2 °C? No, it is not enough. That is why we are telling others that we can negotiate with each other. Politicians and diplomats can negotiate, but we cannot negotiate with science; we cannot negotiate with physics. So let us have a global deal which allows us to reach an agreement compatible with what science tells us. That cannot be done only by Europe, because Europe is responsible for about 14% of global emissions, and the trend is to go down in relevant terms. So, even if Europe, tomorrow, stops completely its greenhouse gas emissions, it will not solve the problem.
Finally, let me say a word to Prime Minister Reinfeldt and the Swedish Presidency. This is the last time we will have a President of the European Council only for six months, so it was the end of many years of European Union work. I want to say - and I said it to President Reinfeldt during these six months - that he was the 11th President of the European Council with whom I have worked, so I really welcome the fact that now we are going to have a permanent President of the European Council.
First of all, of course, the treaty that is now in place is changing the institutional balance of this Union, but it is also making it more capable of achieving our political goals. I would like to point to the fact that we have opened up the process of enlargement by the agreement between Slovenia and Croatia, which is important for Croatia, but also in the perspective of the Western Balkans and their ongoing future process of enlargement. This is one of the strengths of the European Union, but it is also an opportunity for all of us.
I think it is also important to point to the fact that, during this Presidency and while we are standing here, the European Union is, for the first time, a leading global actor in one of the most important international issues mankind is facing. This is new and it gives great responsibilities for the future because it is obvious that, whatever is achieved in Copenhagen, the European Union has been playing a fundamental and crucial role in setting the agenda for the things that we should achieve. However successful we are, the job will not be finished, but it underlines the great responsibilities of the European Union.
(SV) Mr President, I want to start by saying that the Presidency has lived up to the high expectations placed on it as an efficient, diplomatic machine. That is much appreciated, particularly in view of the chaos that sometimes prevailed during the Czech Presidency. The concluding rounds relating to the Treaty of Lisbon were also dealt with in a very positive way. Finally, the Presidency also succeeded in introducing the permanent President of the European Council and the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
The fact that Sweden does not have a more significant role at the climate conference currently taking place in Copenhagen, however, is more likely to be due to Prime Minister Reinfeldt himself, for party political reasons, having played down expectations of the conference at an early stage. This was contrary to the EU's negotiating strategy and exasperated a significant number of other European leaders. More serious than this, however, is the fact that it undermined the opportunity to bring about a good agreement on climate change.
(SV) Mr President, the Swedish Presidency has functioned well in practical and institutional terms. It has been like a well-oiled, efficient machine - and yet it never got into gear. What happened to the social legislation? Work on anti-discrimination has come to a standstill. The proposal to introduce a Eurovignette to stop emissions from heavy goods vehicles has stalled, as has climate policy. On these matters it is researchers and the European Parliament that are showing leadership - the Council has failed!
The Council has provided a loophole for forestry, shipping and airlines in the climate negotiations. Where is the money for the developing countries - the specific EUR 30 billion called for by Parliament? What happened to the emissions targets? Parliament called for reductions of 32-40 percent. Now we hear that the documents the Council is working on water down our emissions targets even further. The Council's climate policy has such large holes in it that it can only be compared with a fishing net for catching whales!
I have spoken in this Chamber repeatedly of the need to reinvigorate the Lisbon strategy; the European Union has, for far too long, pursued political and institutional reform with a degree of energy and determination which it has simply been unable to muster for economic reform. Yet our global trading position, relative economic weight and international competitiveness are in jeopardy. I therefore welcome the Commission's EU 2020 initiative, now endorsed by the European Council, and I congratulate particularly Mr Barroso for his part in this.
On the adoption of the Stockholm Programme, we support the principle that the Member States of the Union must cooperate more to combat problems related to immigration, cross-border crime and terrorism. But these are also areas which lie at the heart of national sovereignty; and defending the laws and ensuring security and protecting the public are amongst the most important duties of a democratic state. We must therefore balance the need for joint action with respect for the rights of our Member States. Parts of the Stockholm Programme simply fail to get the balance right. Some of the proposals will simply centralise power, create unnecessary expense and add further bureaucracy for very little added value. Our priorities must lie in the direction of fitness to compete, deregulation, innovation and job creation. The people of Europe deserve nothing less.
Two areas in particular must come in for criticism. Firstly, the matter of transparency and openness. Sweden is usually seen as setting an example in this area, but instead it has taken a passive approach - and that is a particularly serious matter when our citizens' freedom of communication is at stake. Allow me to mention in this respect the directive on data retention, the telecoms package and the secret ACTA agreement. There have been demands for the Presidency to act to make the documents available, as has been possible since the 2001 amendment to the Regulation on transparency - which states that the public shall have access to all the documents relating to ongoing international negotiations. Why has the Swedish Presidency not acted on this?
The second area is climate change and, in my opinion, the way that poor countries are being betrayed by our use of aid funds to mitigate the worst of the damage for which the rich world has been, and still is, responsible. This despite the fact that the climate convention, the Bali Plan and the Kyoto Protocol all state that funding to finance climate measures must be new funding. Once again, it is the most vulnerable who are having to foot the bill for the actions of the rich countries. It is those who do not have clean water, those threatened by malaria, those suffering from HIV and, above all, the poorest women and children of the world who are now having to pay the price. This policy is a shameful way to treat the poorer parts of the world.
(DE) Mr President, the Swedish Presidency is now coming to an end - with no great disasters, but, in my opinion, without any outstanding successes, either. In any case, the ambitious goal of getting the economic crisis under control could not be achieved. We have pumped billions into a system from which only a few benefit, whereas the public has to bear the risks and the costs. It is unacceptable for European taxpayers' hard-earned money to end up in the bonus pots of bank managers.
(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say thank you. Despite many problems, the Swedish Council Presidency has done a splendid job. Sweden is a medium-sized country in the European Union and we should view that as a positive thing in all respects. I would like to thank you and your entire government, Mr Reinfeldt. With the climate, the financial market crisis, the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Commission, you have had really difficult tasks and issues to deal with. I would like to single out two issues.
The second area is climate policy. We have listened to the criticism from the Communists and the Greens. They do not have any actual responsibility anywhere in Europe. We can pursue climate policy in the style of China or the US by making grand proclamations but not achieving any results. Europe has achieved results. I reject the claim that Greenpeace is the yardstick for European climate policy. We must remain realistic! Here, too, the Swedish Presidency surprisingly achieved very good results during its term, together with the Commission. I would like to express my sincere thanks for this, too.
Therefore, I believe the most important question now is: how and what could we further build on the achievements of the Swedish Presidency? The first thing is the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. A treaty is never enough for solving a problem. Political will is always needed in order to enhance it properly but, in this case, I think that we need even more than will. We need courage and imagination - imagination to fill the gaps or to clarify the ambiguities of the treaty. Therefore, I hope that, starting with the experience it has accumulated, the Swedish Presidency will still remain involved in supporting the building of the new institution which the Lisbon Treaty has created, namely the permanent - or long-term - President of the European Council and the office of High Representative with the External Action Service.
But the conclusion is as follows, and I will end here. I believe that the next step is to pursue bolder and more substantial policies of territorial, economic and social cohesion in Europe - and not fewer policies of this kind - together with bold reforms, financial and economic reforms which would allow us not to repeat the crisis, and, certainly, with policies for post-crisis rehabilitation. In this context, the last statement of the Commission concerning economic support for eastern countries, as well as the readiness expressed by Mr Barroso to debate the 2020 Strategy, should be commended.
The government and the parliament of Scotland have adopted the world's most ambitious climate change act, with emission reduction targets of 42% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. These are targets which we mean to achieve, and yet the UK Government refused a reasonable request for a Scottish minister to be part of the official proceedings in Copenhagen. Such behaviour only underlines the fact that it is only with independence - the normal status of independence - that Scotland can properly contribute to the international community, and I hope that the European Council will very soon be discussing internal enlargement of the European Union, with Scotland leading the way.
Mrs Malmström, I remember you well from the time you were an MEP here. During this presidency, you have been a rather different person. I very much hope that when you return, you will pick up where you left off when you were here, namely being inspired by the parliamentary system. Why did you adopt SWIFT at such a late stage? Why do we now have a kind of executive board at EU level - this being one of the objectives of the Swedes, of all people, with their transparency? Please use your future to return to your roots.
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last two and a half hours of this debate, quite a great deal has been said about Copenhagen and the Copenhagen negotiations. I must say that, in this respect, the Swedish Presidency has not been entirely successful as there is no common position being presented in Copenhagen for the European Union. This is not necessarily the Swedish Presidency's fault, but rather the European Commission's. What is going on and why is there no common position? There is no common position on at least two issues. One of these issues is whether carbon dioxide quotas can be transferred after 2012 and whether they can then be sold as well.
The European Commission criticises this position in an incomprehensible, short-sighted and narrow-minded manner. Hungary, Poland, Romania and other former socialist countries have fulfilled their Kyoto commitments. In fact, not only have they met them, but they have even overfulfilled them. We are entitled to the right to sell excess quotas. However, the Commission still wants to take this from us. In other words, they want to punish contractual compliance, which Hungary has also shown. Others have failed to keep their commitments, even increasing their harmful emissions, but no one wants to punish them. After this, how can we expect the signatories to comply with a new agreement, that is, if there will be a sequel to Kyoto in Copenhagen?
I urge the European Commission, and if he were here, I would urge and emphatically call on President Barroso to change the narrow-minded attitude he has shown so far and stand for a position which complies with the current Kyoto Protocol in force. I would also like to draw your attention to a fact that we should not forget, namely, that without the new Member States, the EU15 would not have been able to meet their 8% emission reduction commitment. In fact, if this had been the case, the European Union would have a much poorer and weaker negotiating position in Copenhagen.
I wish to mention at this point that Parliament will be sure to restore some balance to the proposals that have been referred to it, in order to make the financial markets more robust. The same applies to the financial commitments pledged to the countries of the South to help them combat climate change. Even though, in Copenhagen, poor countries require real commitments concerning long-term financing, the Council has only managed to pledge EUR 7.2 billion over three years. This is a first step, true, but it falls far short of the requirements, all the more so since part of it comes from a restructuring exercise.
Lastly, in the financial field, we welcome the will to impose rules and to act forcefully with regard to both supervision and taxation. I note in particular, in the Council conclusions, the reference to a global financial transaction levy. This is something for which we socialists have been hoping and praying for more than 10 years. There is still work to be done. Seeking out new financial resources to promote employment, solidarity within and outside Europe, and the financing of the fight against climate change, is a major challenge. As it will soon be Christmas, I invite the Council to give us a decision on own resources in the years to come.
(NL) Mr President. Mr Reinfeldt, there is one serious blemish on your Presidency, and that is the decisions taken regarding SWIFT. The Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December, and on 30 November, you and your fellow Heads of State or Government rushed through an arrangement giving our bank details to the United States. If this is an indication of the future development of the Stockholm Programme - a programme intended to guarantee our civil rights, security and freedom - then my impression is that its implementation will really tip the scales and put freedom and civil rights under threat.
(HU) Mr President, we would like to assess the results of the Swedish Presidency retrospectively from a 10-20 year perspective. The most important event that will be mentioned is the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force. This Treaty creates the legal framework for a super state, with the lives of 500 million people being controlled from a central point and the nation states withering away. The path leading us to this was antidemocratic. Three referendums rejected this concept until the imposed second Irish referendum and the acquisition of Václav Klaus's signature created the opportunity for it to happen. The majority of Europe's population rejected this concept, and they want to hold on to the nation state. This is why I am confident that history will portray this period as a frustrated attempt to create an empire.
The institutional debate has been closed, the new posts have been filled and, on a few important points, the Council has moved into a position that will enable us to continue to work. Let us look to the future. Someone said that we have a major problem because the Treaty of Lisbon has not yet been taken into account in the working methods of the Council. The Council has more opportunities to influence the European Parliament and the committees of the European Parliament than the European Parliament has to influence the working groups and the Council meetings. In this respect, too, we demand the equal treatment of the two institutions, as we have equal status as legislators.
Yes, it was a mistake - we can argue about the content - to push SWIFT through in advance of the change in Parliament's power of codecision one day later. The decision on financial market supervision has still not been finalised. We need to make improvements, we need executive power, we need more European supervision where cross-border institutions are concerned and we need to achieve better coordination between the Member States, the Commission and the European Central Bank in the Basel Committee, because otherwise, a parallel structure will be created.
The second aspect that I consider to be a priority, at this time of economic crisis, when we still cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, is the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy. We must be able to get back to competing with the emerging powers on a financial and commercial level as quickly as possible: only a state-of-the-art research and information system will allow us to take this step, which is so vital for us and, above all, for new generations.
Second, in order to control the financial crisis, the European Union and its Member States have implemented a large number of exceptional measures, which is very positive. It is already possible to see stabilisation in the economy. At the same time, I agree with the Council that the situation is not yet secure enough for us to give up the support measures. The consequence of the crisis, for me, is definitely the fact that banks are necessary and the services they provide are necessary. It is not necessary, therefore, to go too far in punishing them, but banking activities should be based on what is happening in the real economy, not on an inter-bank virtual market, which was the main reason for the recent crisis. At the same time, we need to consider the payment of bankers' bonuses, an issue which has become a particularly important topic in Estonia.
Our verdict on the Swedish Presidency is that it has been an almost total success, basically in four fundamental areas. Firstly, in the institutional area, the Swedish Presidency's contribution to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, to the highly successful election of the President of the Commission and to everything associated with ratification was extremely professional and at the level that we expect for best practice in the European Union. Of course, for a country like Portugal, which played a decisive role in the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Swedish Presidency's contribution was invaluable.
My third point is financial regulation. Especially with this latest Council, there has been a step forwards that we regard as decisive and which may have a great impact on our emergence from the crisis. I would therefore also like to pass on our congratulations for having achieved an agreement in that area. Lastly, I would like to mention an area that is very important to me personally: the Stockholm Programme and, therefore, the area of freedom, security and justice. I followed both the Tampere process and subsequently, in particular, the Hague process. I regard the Stockholm Programme as absolutely essential and would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency and Prime Minister Reinfeldt on it.
Of course, what is important for European Union citizens is, in particular, action intended to reduce the effects of the economic and financial crisis. This is related to support for the business sector, in order to restore jobs and create conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises to develop, as well as to eliminate the causes of the crisis, particularly in financial markets, so that they will not be repeated in the future. It seems to me that European supervision in this area is insufficient, and that here we must also influence, as a democratically elected institution, the ethical standards followed by those who supervise banks and financial institutions.
With regard to comitology, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, negotiations have started on an institutional agreement on powers and procedures delegated by the Commission. Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Lisbon creates a new basis both for climate change and a common energy policy, I hope, and we also expect it from the European Commission, President Barroso, that you will present to us a programme of work for the next five years, so that the commissioners we listen to can respond to these challenges as well.
You have also experienced the bitter realisation of the limitations of the European Union when it comes to unity of action, especially at the time we were electing the EU's leadership. You have set a few new standards in the field of foreign policy, in the Middle East, for example, and I congratulate you on that achievement. Thank you also for the attention you have paid to the enlargement of the European Union and for resolving, together with the Commission, some unfinished issues which stood in the way of this process. A job well done!
(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, I would like to know your view, Mr Reinfeldt, on the conclusions of the Troika, since the Heads of State or Government decided to create this troika concept in order to give a sense of continuity to the Presidency. Furthermore, since you are concluding the Troika between the French Republic, the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden, what is your view on this instrument and what conclusion do you draw from it?
The Swedish Presidency will go down in history because its term saw the pushing through of the Euro-constitution, for which some had been agitating for nearly 10 years, and which in its current form is known as the Treaty of Lisbon. This was done against the will of many nations. The results of referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland were ostentatiously brushed aside. The principle of a democracy deficit was introduced, which allows control from above, ostensibly to improve EU administrative mechanisms. The first changes related to the selection of people for new positions in the Union have, for the time being, brought in organisational chaos and caused general amusement in Europe and around the world. The Swedish Presidency is, in fact, leaving the European Union in a state of uncertainty and chaos.
(HU) The Swedish Presidency has done an excellent job, and I would like to congratulate the prime minister for this. The final completion of the Treaty of Lisbon's ratification resolved the regrettable and disgraceful mini-crisis involving the Czech President Klaus. This situation resulted from the political mistake made during the enlargement process where the European Union did not declare earlier that the 13 discriminatory Beneš Decrees were morally untenable. The second major event is that the EU managed to establish a united position for the climate change negotiations. The US and China have still not realised this fact, but the European Union clearly understands that the future belongs to whoever now leads the way in green economic development. Let us not forget that the only reason the EU was able to achieve its targets was that the new Member States had reduced their emissions significantly. Finally, the third major event was that accession negotiations got under way with Serbia, and Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro were granted visa-free travel. I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for creating an excellent opportunity for the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency.
(PL) During the Swedish Presidency, a great deal of good has happened in the Union, in what has been, of course, a difficult period of crisis and expectations concerning acceptance of the Treaty of Lisbon. I do not, however, share the opinion that we have a different Union or a new Union. I think we have, at most, a renewed Union. In fact, the general provisions of the treaty must be supplemented, not only with detailed content, but also with specific practical solutions. It is important to clarify the division of competences between key posts, and how we establish relations between EU institutions, including the new role of the European Parliament
My fears are aroused by possible restrictions on the function of the rotating presidency held by successive Member States. This leadership role is something Member States prepare for and discharge with great determination. If, alongside the permanent President of the European Council, we do not also have the leader of the country which currently has the leadership giving reports here, the Union will be incomplete and will lose some of its diversity. The countries which lead must still creatively inspire new action, and the permanent President of the European Council will have to ensure coordination, continuity and cohesion of the Union's work.
Prime Minister, in two weeks' time, your presidency of the European Union will come to an end. Thank you for your activity and for your energy. It has not been an easy presidency; we know that. As we heard from our Members, and the many points of view expressed, it has been a successful presidency. I wish to thank you personally and, indeed, the entire Swedish Government. For the first time in history, we experienced, over the last few weeks, new relations as a result of the Lisbon Treaty.
For instance, Mr Severin spoke about economic, social and territorial cohesion, and I want to underline the point he made. In fact, in the first exchange of views which we had in the European Council on the future European Union 2020 Strategy, it was agreed - see point 18 of the conclusions - that every effort should be made to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion as well as gender equality. I think it is important to have this from the beginning of the discussion of the European Union 2020 Strategy. Of course, the emphasis is on competitiveness and the need to respond to the global challenges which we are now facing, but we should do that in conjunction with promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion in the European Union. This is going to be very important, not only for the definition of this strategy, but also for the next financial perspectives.
Another concrete point regarding the European supervisory authorities was raised, namely by Mr Karas and also by Ms Dati. Let me be clear on this matter. We very much welcome the fact that the European Council was able to reach a unanimous agreement. Frankly, some time ago, it would have been inconceivable to have all the Member States agreeing on a text on financial supervision at European level. Having said this, while I respect the delicate nature of some of the issues addressed by our proposals, I believe the Commission's text has been diluted a bit too much. The Commission, in its proposal, had foreseen a simple and workable fiscal safeguard clause, precisely because this is a very sensitive matter. Anyway, I regret the removal of the proposed powers of the authorities to address decisions directly to individual financial institutions in two out of the three situations where the Commission had proposed it.
We will continue to assess mitigation plans from other countries and take this decision at the appropriate time in Copenhagen. In fact, during the European Council, I had mentioned the possibility of having some modulation in our offer, namely the possibility of constructing some pathways beyond 2020. This discussion is not just about 2020; it is for after 2020. So we should have some flexibility on the pathways that we can define after 2020. It is in this spirit that we go to Copenhagen not only to achieve the most ambitious agreement but also to have a real global agreement.
The EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region was endorsed during the Swedish Presidency. I am delighted that financial support has been earmarked for the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region. As a Lithuanian, I know all too well the challenges that the Baltic Sea region faces today. One of these is how best to resolve the urgent and serious problem of protecting the Baltic Sea environment. Another is how to transform the Baltic Sea region into a more powerful engine for economic growth and development.
Debate on a common patent for the entire Union has been going on for a long time. It is high time to establish specific rules on this, because the lack of uniform regulations constitutes a barrier to the development of European businesses, and makes it difficult for them to compete, for example, with American firms. Many times in the past, we have seen how difficult it is to reconcile the interests of all Member States in the matter of the EU patent, and so I am all the more grateful to the Swedish Presidency for the compromise, for the moment, only at the political level, which has been achieved.
in writing. - The green light has been given to the Lisbon Treaty, which has created all necessary circumstances for institutional reforms. The Swedish Presidency's role was to pave the way for the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty's provisions. It coped with this challenge. The next Presidency's task is to ensure that the new structures function effectively. In this context, every effort should be made to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion and gender equality. I find it important to emphasise that with the treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be binding, so human rights (including gender equality) and anti-discrimination issues will have a better chance to be upheld via the law.
The Treaty of Lisbon has strengthened Parliament's role in the European decision-making process and, by extension, the legitimacy of this institution in the eyes of Europe's citizens. Consequently, I congratulate the Swedish Presidency for the outstanding efforts made to bring about the new treaty's entry into force. I equally welcome the developments in the areas of justice and internal affairs. The Stockholm Programme, which was drafted during recent months and voted for at the European Council on 10-11 December, outlines the new reference framework in this area for the 2010-2014 period. I am pleased to note that consideration was given to Parliament's recommendations by the Council. I am referring, in particular, to the extension of the Schengen area to all EU countries, which now becomes a priority for the European Union's internal policy, following the amendments we tabled.
I wish to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for the six months of ambitious work it has carried out in the difficult climate of the economic and financial crisis, the preparations for the Copenhagen Summit and the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, we finally have the clear institutional framework for tackling all the challenges facing the modern world. The new treaty enables the EU to firmly assume a pioneering role in the battle against climate change, as well as the status of a global player, not only in relation to the United States and the Russian Federation, but in relation to the emerging countries as well. In addition, the new permanent President of the Council and High Representative will ensure continuity in the EU's foreign policy activities, which marks progress in consolidating the EU's role on the world stage. As a result of all these institutional changes, the EU will be more efficient and have available a wider range of methods for resolving the major problems facing the international community, such as combating terrorism, adapting to climate change, ensuring energy security and combating the effects of the economic and financial crisis. I am sure that the Spanish Presidency will be able to meet expectations and successfully continue the actions and activities initiated by the Swedish Presidency.
I should like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on its work, particularly in those areas that come under the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. The challenges were huge: there was the transition from the legal system of the Treaty of Nice to that provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon and also the drafting of the next multiannual programme, which will define the priorities to be given to the area of freedom, security and justice for the next five years. I wish to commend this Stockholm Programme, which will boost the ambitious political efforts to enhance this area by 2014. However, considerable progress remains to be made, and this mainly in the area of asylum. I welcome the creation of the European Asylum Support Office, since it is vital to approximate not only the laws but also the practices of the Member States. Nevertheless, the other proposals in the asylum package will have to be adopted as quickly as possible so as to prevent a third phase of the European Common Asylum System from having to be developed. With the major institutional changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, we can now look forward to the imminent adoption of more ambitious and higher quality legislative instruments under the forthcoming presidencies.
The Swedish Presidency has signified progress through three major actions: - the election of the EU President and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force; - the adoption of the 'Stockholm Multiannual Programme for the 2010-2014 period'; - the preparation and coordination of the COP 15 negotiations on climate change in Copenhagen. I welcome the Council's decision on the EU and its Member States being prepared to make a contribution with rapid initial funding of EUR 2.4 billion a year for the 2010-2012 period in order to support developing countries in adapting to the effects of climate change. However, I call on the Commission to devise a suitable mechanism for distributing the financial burden between Member States according to each one's economic power.
In connection with the consultations which are currently under way on the future strategy, I would like to draw attention to two aspects: improvement of the education system in Europe and equality of the sexes in the labour market. The education system in Europe must change. Building a modern, knowledge-based economy is not possible without young, well-educated workers. We should ensure greater financial support for current EU programmes (Erasmus, Erasmus Mundus, Leonardo da Vinci) and establish new initiatives which will help young people to learn and to gain experience abroad, and will also provide the financial and administrative possibilities necessary to use this support at work in their own country.
The Union, in making a priority of the citizens' needs, should adopt a programme which, in every area of its operation, promotes equality of the sexes, and particularly in the fight against unemployment. When planning the new strategy, we should place special emphasis on raising the proportion of women in employment, for research carried out by Eurostat shows that the crisis has affected working women more than men, among other reasons, because they work in jobs which are much less secure. Discrimination in the labour market remains a serious problem, and the new strategy must face up to it.
Despite the difficulties resulting from the delayed entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Swedish Presidency achieved some notable successes. They include the energy efficiency package and the telecoms package, the creation of a prudential financial supervisory body, agreement on the 2010 budget, particularly as regards financing the economic recovery plan, the Baltic Sea strategy and alignment for this week's Copenhagen climate conference. The Spanish Presidency to begin in 2010 will guide the transition from Nice to Lisbon and will continue the strategy of promoting employment by stimulating and promoting European economies, as well as addressing other major challenges such as financial regulation and climate change. Because of its geographical and historical proximity, Portugal and especially the outermost regions such as Madeira, which are looking forward to seeing how the Spanish Presidency performs, must try to make the most of the opportunities that will surely be generated. The pioneering EU-Morocco Summit, for example, will be an ideal forum for promoting the Euro-African Atlantic Cooperation Area, which will include Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries and neighbouring countries, especially Morocco. I shall put all my efforts into it and will monitor it closely.
Mr President, the decisions made by the summit signal an escalation in the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union and the bourgeois governments and harsh measures against the working class and grassroots sections of society in order to strengthen the profitability and position of European monopolies, both within the framework of the single internal market and in international imperialist competition. The EU strategy for 2020, a deeper version of the Lisbon Strategy, sets as priorities faster capitalist restructurings and the demolition of the workers' remaining wage, labour and social rights. The cornerstone of the EU exit strategy from the capitalist crisis is to impose sweeping changes in social security systems, to increase the retirement age and to drastically cut wages, pensions and social benefits. Deficits and public debt and the procedures for supervising the economies of various Member States, including Greece, are being mobilised in order to ideologically terrorise the workers. This anti-grassroots EU policy also bears the hallmark of the PASOK and New Democracy parties, which continue to support the choices of capital, while shifting the consequences of the crisis on to the workers' shoulders. The Greek Communist Party calls on the working class to organise its counterattack, to condemn the parties of the European one-way street and to participate en masse in the unemployment rally on 17 December being organised by the class forces of the All Workers Militant Front.
(CS) I voted against the Böge report on releasing resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund because, particularly in the case of the Austrian request, it involves a highly unsystematic approach which is reflected in an unprecedented high level of support per person. If there must be time limited individual support aimed at assisting workers affected by redundancies as a result of globalisation, such support must relate to real individual needs and the real economic context. However, this is not happening and, on the contrary, the procedure for determining this support has been haphazard and arbitrary. In my opinion it is therefore necessary to set out firm criteria. Using the funds in this way is no solution to the problem but is actually a waste of taxpayers' money.
But we also have to look within our own borders to see how we are setting up barriers to facilitating trade with poorer countries. In many cases, poorer countries see the trade rules as skewed against them and they look at things like the common agricultural policy, cotton subsidies, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, and the tariffs on higher value imports to the EU. It is important that we show that the trading system is truly open and that we help the poorest countries as much as possible to eradicate poverty.
Three years on from its creation in 2006, and in the current context of global economic and financial crisis, it was crucial to ease the conditions governing use of this European fund. Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands are today the target of these more effective and rapid measures, and I look forward to all the EU Member States having greater access to this finance. Linked as it is to the financial framework for 2007-2013, the maximum annual amount of the Fund may not exceed EUR 500 million, but it is crucial that these resources are implemented in full, which is not the case today.
Swedish, Austrian and Dutch workers are being sacrificed to globalisation. We reiterate our strong opposition to the philosophy underpinning this fund, which makes European workers mere 'adjustment variables' enabling the smooth running of a form of neoliberal globalisation that is never called into question. The interests of giants such as the US company Ford, the current owner of Volvo Cars, which cleared a profit of almost USD 1 billion in the third quarter of 2009, or Aviva, Axa and BlackRock, the main shareholders of Heijmans NV, today supplant the general interest of European citizens. The fund is contributing to this despoilment.
Once again, the consequences of globalisation are having to be cushioned through the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This time, unfortunately, Styria has also been hard hit. A total of 744 people from nine different companies have lost their jobs over the last few months, and that is why the Province of Styria has asked the EU for assistance. As with previous applications, everything has been examined very thoroughly and I am pleased that the people of Styria meet all of the requirements. Especially during the current financial and economic crisis, we are being very clearly reminded once again of the negative effects of globalisation.
The current situation in the financial markets requires that we support many millions of people who have lost their jobs over the past year. I am not, of course, talking only about help in looking for work, but also about using the elasticity of the labour market, helping workers to gain new qualifications and organising appropriate training, for example, in the use of computers or giving careers advice. Most of the money in the EGF should be designated for promoting entrepreneurship and giving assistance with self-employment because, when people have lost their job, setting up a business and generating an income on their own account represents an opportunity to maintain financial stability and to develop.
The redundancies made by Volvo Cars are considered by the Commission to have a 'significant negative effect on the local and regional economy' in western Sweden. Volvo Cars is a very important employer in western Sweden. If the European Parliament does not take action, workers at Volvo Cars and its suppliers will be badly affected. The risk of social marginalisation and permanent exclusion is very great, which is something that, as Liberals, we cannot accept. We strongly sympathise with all those affected by unemployment and would very much like to see training made available for them.
The report itself justifies our position when it stresses that 'there are different reasons for the apparent slow-down in payments compared to the expected rhythm depending on the Member State concerned. Firstly, the current economic situation has, in some cases, caused difficulties for the provision of national cofinancing. Secondly, the fact that Rural Development implementation in 2009 shows a less dynamic profile than the relevant year of the previous programming period is explained by the late approval of certain programmes as well as, in the case of Romania and Bulgaria, a lack of sufficient previous experience in the implementation of Rural Development programmes.'
I voted against the motion, because overall, it promotes the liberalisation of markets and a trade system which is solely to the detriment of poor and developing countries and shows no real concern for the environmental needs of the planet. I consider that the liberalisation of trade and its catastrophic results, which have contributed to the current financial, economic, climate and food crisis, and to job losses, poverty and deindustrialisation, should be rejected. I also voted against the motion because it does not safeguard full respect for the rights of governments to protect their ability to regulate and provide fundamental services, especially in the field of public goods and services such as health, education, culture, communications, transport, water and energy.
I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on the prospects for the Doha Development Agenda following the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference. I did so from a general perspective because it clearly lacks vision in terms of promoting development and respect for developing countries, but more specifically because, while it is vital to successfully conclude the Doha Round, this cannot be done at any price. International trade must take account of Europe's longstanding tradition of cooperating with the poorest countries. Moreover, on the subject of agriculture and the liberalisation of services, I do not support the approach recommended by this resolution, all the more so since not all of the amendments that were designed to balance the text have been accepted. For example, agreeing to step up the negotiations in the services sector (in order to achieve a greater degree of liberalisation) is out of the question.
I am in favour of the European Union playing a leading role in the current WTO negotiations, so as to conclude the Doha Round while bearing in mind the new global challenges, such as climate change, security and food sovereignty. I hope that the outcome will result in new market opportunities and a strengthening of the rules on multilateral trade, so as to place trade at the service of sustainable development. The WTO could manage globalisation better. I recognise, however, that in the context of the current economic crisis, the rules and commitments adopted within the WTO have largely prevented its members from turning to restrictive trade measures and have led them to adopt economic recovery measures.
By rejecting our proposed amendments, they said no to a sea change in the negotiations, which would have prioritised development and social advancement, the creation of jobs with rights, and the fight against hunger and poverty. It is deplorable that they did not consider it a top priority to abolish tax havens, promote food sovereignty and security, support quality public services and respect governments' right to preserve their economies and public services, particularly in the areas of health, education, water, culture, communications and energy.
No, global free trade is not a solution to the current crisis. On the contrary, it is one of its main causes. The Doha Round negotiations have faltered from the start and have been at a standstill for a year because of a fundamental problem, namely, the system has reached its tolerable limits for everyone - be they developed, emerging or least developed, which is the international jargon for those countries that are poverty stricken and forced to integrate into an ultra-competitive global market that swallows them up. In Europe, we live according to the paradox perpetuated by the pseudo-elites who govern us and who want us all to be rich and poor at the same time: poor, because we have to be underpaid to compete in the trade war that pits us against countries with low levels of pay, and rich, so that we can consume the cheap and often low-quality imports that are flooding our markets.
I hope that the Doha Development Round will lead to our establishing fair and equitable trade relations. That is why I have endorsed the amendments by my political group, which are aimed at improving this resolution in order to strengthen the demands relating to development; to request that public services not be called into question in the negotiations on services; to request, in relation to industrial tariffs, that the need to take account of each country's development level and not to suddenly open these sectors up to competition be recognised; and, lastly, that special and differential treatment for certain types of production in the agricultural sector be preserved.
After 30 years of free market fundamentalism, the global economy is facing the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The neoliberal agenda of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), involving deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation of services, has brought further poverty for the majority of the world's population, both in developing and industrialised countries. My group has always rejected trade liberalisation and its devastating effects, which are contributing to the current financial, economic, climatic and food crisis.
The joint motion for a resolution from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the Doha Development Agenda and the WTO continues the trend of global liberalisation in all economic areas. There is no doubt that breaking down barriers to trade and increasing trade in some areas brings greater prosperity. We have also seen that free trade, in particular, between similarly developed countries, is also beneficial.
However, if the trading partners are too different in terms of their stage of development, there are, in many cases, negative effects for both parties. The complete opening up of the markets of the developing countries to exports from industrialised countries has sometimes resulted in the destruction of the local economic structure, an increased level of poverty for the people and, as a consequence, more people wanting to migrate to Western countries. On the other hand, Europe has been inundated with cheap goods from the Far East, the manufacture of which has, in many cases, involved the exploitation of workers. Domestic production has been relocated or shut down, which has resulted in unemployment in Europe. From this point of view, therefore, certain barriers to trade, for example, to maintain food sovereignty in Europe, make perfect sense. It should not be forgotten that the liberalisation of services on the financial markets played a huge part in the current financial and economic crisis. Nevertheless, the motion for a resolution speaks in favour of continuing the process of liberalisation and of giving the WTO a greater role as part of a new global order policy and, for this reason, I voted against it.
I have today voted against the resolution on the Doha Development Agenda because I am opposed to any kind of liberalisation of public services. I am thinking in particular of the liberalisation of the water supply, health services and services in the energy sector. For the cohesion of society, it is essential that all citizens have access to public services. These services must be provided to a high quality, with respect for the principle of universality and, above all, they must be affordable. In this regard, the national authorities should have a great deal of discretionary power and broad opportunities to shape their services.
In this era of globalisation, an effective system for regulating trade is more relevant than ever. This is the role of the World Trade Organisation, which was created in 1995 to replace GATT. As is emphasised in the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the right of Parliament, which I voted for this lunchtime, the WTO has an essential role to play in ensuring that globalisation is managed better and that its benefits are distributed more evenly. Clearly, those who are in favour of protectionism, of turning in on ourselves, are picking the wrong target when they make the WTO the deadly weapon of uncontrolled liberalisation. It was the current Director-General of this United Nations body, Pascal Lamy, who indicated the path to follow in 1999: that, conversely, of controlled globalisation.
It is with pleasure that I welcome the resolution about the WTO, because it is an exceptionally important problem at the present time. The crisis is global in nature, and getting out of it as quickly as possible is in the interests of all of us. I think one way of effectively limiting the crisis is to expand world trade. Restricting the reform of economies to a regional or national level is easier, but in the long run, it is not a good way to fight the crisis, which is global in extent, and fighting it requires common instruments used on a world scale. Therefore, we should do everything to speed up negotiations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation because these negotiations are liberalising trade. At the same time, we must adopt sound principles of competitiveness. In these principles, product quality standards and conditions of production are especially important, including in the context of fighting climate change and reducing CO2 emissions. Highly sensitive goods, such as agricultural and food products, require an exceptionally sound approach. In the future, we should think about whether, along with liberalisation of trade in agricultural goods within the framework of the WTO on a world level, we should not also introduce standardisation of some elements of agricultural policy at world level. The specific nature of the agricultural sector should be taken into account - its dependence on climatic conditions, questions of quality related to food security, conditions of production and the problem of safeguarding the world's food supply. In the WTO negotiations, we need to show greater understanding of others and more goodwill.
I voted against the motion, because it is predicated entirely on the doctrine and policy of the 'war against terror', which is still being used to justify restrictions on rights and freedoms and to legalise military intervention and actions introduced under the Lisbon Treaty. Also, the European Parliament has ultimately been excluded from colegislation, examination and control of measures relating to individual rights and anti-terrorist policies, thereby weakening its role on crucial issues. Finally, I would emphasise that, apart from anything else, unfortunately an amendment was passed distorting the role of NGOs, converting them into information providers and a vehicle of the various 'anti-terrorist' security services, instead of helpers in the societies in which they are active.
Public access to documents is an essential factor in ensuring that there is democratic control of the institutions and that they operate effectively, thus increasing citizens' trust. In the framework of the Stockholm Programme, the Council reaffirmed the importance of transparency and invited the Commission to examine the best way to ensure transparency in the decision-making process, document access and good governance, in view of the new opportunities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon. I am in no doubt that the legal basis for the regulation applicable to document access needs changing, as does the legal context in which it should operate, particularly with regard to the relation between the Union's institutions and the citizens.
We realise that another framework of compliance with international law is needed. We do not accept the policy of double standards in relation to governments of third states, natural or legal persons, groups or non-state entities, assessed according to the interests of the United States or the major European powers. There is no lack of examples. To mention just a few, we have the cases of the illegal occupation of Western Sahara, Aminatou Haidar and other Sahrawis detained in Morocco, and Turkey's actions against the Kurds and against Cyprus.
I voted in favour of this resolution because it is important for we MEPs to exercise our parliamentary control over decisions to impose sanctions against persons associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as persons who threaten the rule of law in Zimbabwe and Somalia. The chosen legal basis is unacceptable; we ask to be consulted under the ordinary legislative procedure and to be kept informed of developments in the work of the UN Sanctions Committee. Lastly, on this matter, I regret the highly administrative approach that the Council is maintaining even though we are talking here about measures relating to individual rights.
in writing. - The ECR Group are the strongest supporters of measures against terrorists in the EU and especially believe that national governments within the European Union must work together to tackle the constant threat from terrorism. The ECR Group have nevertheless decided to abstain on this resolution for two specific reasons: First, we oppose any legislation moving us towards a common European foreign and security policy but secondly, we instead want to see improved and strengthened coordination and cooperation between the EU and national governments, and are very disappointed that this resolution did not sufficiently reflect that.
The common sense behind the questions that have been asked goes beyond a mere evaluation of doctrine and the consistency between declared intentions and their interpretation. There is also a practical consequence, which arises from the old saying that he who can do the greater can certainly do the lesser, and it concerns the following: what sense is there for a body that has competence in criminal matters and in preventing and combating terrorist attacks, through being involved in a codecision process, to be subsequently excluded a priori when other measures are at stake which, by affecting citizens' rights, may even be important in this context as well?
It is fundamentally important that the way the Treaty of Lisbon is interpreted in legislation corresponds in reality to the stated strengthening of Parliament's powers and competences. At the very least, in some cases, as was raised in the question, it should be possible to have a dual legal basis when the rights of citizens are at stake and anti-terrorism policies are threatened. In other cases, such as Zimbabwe and Somalia, optional consultation should be envisaged, as in fact is enshrined in the Stuttgart Declaration on the European Union, which was also mentioned in the question.
In recent years, more and more liberties have been curtailed in the name of combating terror. With the SWIFT Agreement and the Stockholm Programme, in particular, the 'transparent person' is becoming ever more a reality. Of course, in a time of modern technology, globalisation and a borderless EU, it is important for the authorities to work together and also to prepare themselves accordingly. However, the state must not sink to the level of the terrorists. We only have to think of the questionable role of the EU and individual Member States in connection with CIA overflights and secret US prisons.
Memorial views this award as being not only for our organisation: the prize is being awarded to the entire human rights community in Russia and, more broadly, to an appreciable section of Russian society. For 40 years now, first in the Soviet Union and then in Russia, human rights defenders have been standing up for 'European' - that is to say, universal - values. This struggle has always been tragic and has, in recent years, claimed the lives of the best and the most fearless. I am sure that, in awarding the Sakharov Prize to Memorial, the European Parliament had them in mind, first and foremost - our dead friends and comrades-in-arms. This prize belongs by right to them. And the first name I should cite is that of Natalya Estemirova, a fellow member of Memorial, murdered this summer in Chechnya. I cannot go on without mentioning other names, too: the lawyer, Stanislav Markelov, and journalists, Anna Politkovskaya and Anastasia Baburova, murdered in Moscow; ethnologist, Nikolai Girenko, shot in St Petersburg; Farid Babayev, murdered in Dagestan; and many others - sadly, this list could go on for a long time. I would ask you to rise to honour the memory of these people.
Andrei Sakharov, who died 20 years ago, was a distinguished champion of human rights as well as a distinguished thinker. He advanced two major propositions. The first was that only by overcoming political disunity and enmity does humanity have the chance to survive and develop, and the opportunity to cope with the global challenges of the age and to secure world peace and progress on our planet. The second proposition was that the only reliable support for our efforts to overcome the political disunity of the modern world is human rights and, first and foremost, intellectual freedom.
In recent times, Russia and Europe have been increasingly set in opposition to one another. In Russia, it has become fashionable to talk about 'Russia's special path', about 'Russia's special spirituality' and even about 'special national values'. And in the Euro-Atlantic world, one often hears opinions of Russia as an 'odd man out' among countries, one whose political development is determined by its history and specific characteristics, and similar speculative constructs. What is there to say in this regard? Russia, just like any other country, has its own path towards ordering life on the basis of universal human foundations. No nation in the world organises its life according to ideas and designs entirely borrowed from outside, but Russia's connection with Europe is far from being determined only by who borrows and from whom. The question can be put another way: has Russia brought something to the pan-European and universal civilisation taking shape before our eyes? And here I would like to recall Russia's unique contribution to the spiritual and political progress of Europe and humanity: the key role played by the Soviet human rights movement in forming modern political culture.
Sakharov rethought the role of human rights and intellectual freedom in the modern world as far back as 1968. His ideas were transferred to the practical level by the human rights organisations created by Soviet dissidents - first and foremost, the Moscow Helsinki Group, represented here today by Lyudmila Alexeyeva. These organisations were the first to declare publicly that fine-sounding declarations about international protection of human rights could not just remain declarations. We succeeded in mobilising world public opinion and the Western political elite was forced to move away from its traditional pragmatism. Naturally, this development also gave rise to a multitude of new problems that are still not fully resolved - an example being the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. Nevertheless, over the last 30 years a considerable amount has been achieved, although much more still lies ahead to be done. Russian human rights defenders of the 1970s were at the origins of this process and, if only for that reason, Russia cannot be struck from the list of European countries.
In Russia, in the last third of the 20th century, as nowhere else, the human rights movement became synonymous with citizenship and Russian human rights thinking was able to develop as far as Sakharov's global generalisations and take on the quality of a new political philosophy. This is linked to the unique nature of Russia's tragic history in the 20th century, to the need to comprehend and overcome the bloody and dirty past. If the Second World War was the impetus for the post-war political modernisation of Western Europe, having become the logical conclusion of the relatively short period of domination by the Nazi regime in Germany, then for the USSR and Russia, the need for reconstruction was dictated by the experience of 70 years of domination by the Communist regime, the culmination of which was Stalin's terrorist dictatorship. The two key components of resurgent Russian citizenship were legal consciousness and historical memory. The human rights movement positioned itself, from the outset, first and foremost as a movement for overcoming Stalinism in the public, political and cultural life of the country. In one of this movement's first public texts - a leaflet distributed by the organisers of the historic meeting of 5 December 1965 in defence of the law - it was said in this regard, with the utmost simplicity and brevity: 'The bloody past calls us to vigilance in the present'.
It is my view that now also, on the 20th anniversary of Sakharov's death, the Members of the European Parliament, in choosing the recipient of the Prize, also felt and understood this specific aspect. We all remember the resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism, adopted by the European Parliament in April. This resolution, like the OSCE resolution that followed in July, on divided Europe reunited, demonstrates that a united Europe understands the sense and thrust of our work. Memorial thanks you for this understanding. The absurdity of the present-day political situation in Russia is illustrated clearly by the fact that our own Parliament - the Parliament of the country that suffered most and longest of all from Stalinism and Communist dictatorship - instead of warmly supporting these resolutions, immediately declared them 'anti-Russian'!
In recent years, more than 100 judgments have been delivered in Strasbourg in 'Chechen' cases, concerning serious crimes by representatives of the state against citizens. Yet what happens? Nothing. Russia duly pays the victims the compensation ordered by the European Court, as some sort of 'impunity tax', refusing to investigate the crimes and punish those guilty. Moreover, not only are all the generals mentioned by name in the Strasbourg judgments not brought before the courts, but they are put forward for promotion.
The second, more general, example concerns relations between Russia and the European Union in the area of human rights. Today they virtually boil down to the fact that the European Union holds consultations with Russia on this subject once every six months. How is this opportunity used? Officials, not of the highest rank, talk for a few hours behind closed doors - Europe asks about Chechnya, Russia answers with a question about Estonia or Latvia, and they go their separate ways for another six months. Both Russian and international non-governmental organisations hold fringe events and hearings, and present reports. In meetings with human rights defenders, the representatives of Brussels sigh sadly: 'What can we do?' - and remain silent.
So what should Europe do in relation to Russia? From our point of view, the answer is simple: it should act towards Russia just as it does towards any other European country that has taken on certain obligations and has a responsibility to meet them. Alas, today, Europe increasingly rarely formulates its recommendations to Russia in the area of democracy and human rights, sometimes even preferring not to mention them at all. It is not important why this is the case - whether it is a sense of the futility of efforts or pragmatic considerations linked to oil and gas.
One would think, how can thought not be free, who can limit its freedom and how? There is a means - it is the fear that becomes part of a person's personality and makes that person think and even feel as required. People are not only afraid; they find an outlet in 'loving Big Brother', as described by George Orwell. So it was when Russia had Stalin, and so it was when Germany had Hitler. This is now being repeated in Chechnya, under Ramzan Kadyrov. Such fear can spread throughout Russia.
An overall initiative is required. We all need to do more and to do better. In June, the Council asked the Council Secretariat and the Commission to put forward specific recommendations and political priorities to strengthen and enhance our commitment in the region. The result was the EU action plan for strengthening the EU's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This was adopted in October. I believe that this action plan is a good tool. The basic strategy is already in place. The action plan will allow us to adapt the instruments currently being used to meet our political priorities.
Afghanistan is entering a decisive period. There is no need to discuss the election process further. That is behind us. It left much to be desired and we hope that it will not be repeated. I believe that is also the opinion of the Afghan people. The EU is prepared to support the work that remains to be done, based - among other things - on the recommendations made by the EU's election observers. We hope that a new government will soon be in place. This represents an opportunity to agree on a new agenda and a new concord between the Afghan Government and the international community. President Karzai made a welcome promise of a new start in his inaugural address. We hope that the conference to be held in London shortly will create some momentum.
The EU expects a strong commitment and leadership from President Karzai and his government. Five years with no change is not an option. The focus must now be on ensuring that the Afghan state gradually takes on more responsibility, with the international community adopting a supporting role. By this I do not mean withdrawal. Next year, there will be significantly greater numbers of international personnel in Afghanistan. The US is sending an additional 30 000 personnel to supplement the 68 000 already in the country. Other NATO countries and allies have promised an extra 7 000 personnel at least, in addition to the 38 000 already there.
This military commitment must be matched by civil initiatives. There can be no lasting military withdrawal from Afghanistan unless a civil framework for stability is in place. Effective state institutions, better forms of government, access to basic welfare, the rule of law and a functioning civil state are at least as important as hard security. Nobody would question this. Security, good governance and development must go hand in hand. We are making a long-term commitment to Afghanistan. However, the Afghan people must ensure that it is their own government, not international organisations, that bring about an improvement in living standards. That is the only way for the population to regain trust in their leaders. The international community is there. We will need to do more and to do better. We need to support the process that is under way - the Afghanisation process that is so essential for the country.
That is the core of our action plan. We are strengthening efforts by the EU to improve Afghan capabilities and we are cooperating with the government to promote effective state institutions that can be held responsible, at both local and regional level. We place great importance on the principle of the rule of law, good governance, the fight against corruption and on improving the human rights situation. Agriculture and rural development are a further priority area for Europe. It is very important that the standard of living is increased for the great majority of Afghans who live in rural areas. We are also prepared to support an Afghan-led rehabilitation process for former militants. Those who have taken part in conflict in the past must be offered alternatives. Support for the electoral system will naturally also be high on the agenda.
I would also like to say a few words about Pakistan. Pakistan is a country that has been through major changes in recent years. The 2008 elections re-established democracy and civilian rule. The transition to democracy has been impressive. However, democracy is currently in a fragile and unstable state. At the same time, the Pakistani Taliban has become a real threat to peace and stability in the country. Scarcely a week passes without media reports of further suicide attacks. In the past week, more than 400 people have been killed in attacks carried out by militant groups.
The EU wants to help support Pakistan's civil institutions. It is particularly important to follow up the recommendations made by Michael Gahler, our 2008 election observer. These provide a basic framework for future democracy, electoral reform and institution building. The Pakistani Government knows that this must be done. It must indicate to us the areas in which it wishes to cooperate. The EU will develop the strategic partnership with Pakistan that resulted from the successful special summit in June 2009. We want to strengthen democracy and achieve stability. That is why we are working on the civil state, the fight against terrorism and trade. Naturally, a functioning government that accepts responsibility for its people and demonstrates the leadership required to take the country forward is a central element of this.
In partnership with the government of Pakistan, the EU will support the strengthening of the country's democratic institutions and structures. This will also be brought about through economic development and trade. We welcome the fact that Pakistan is taking greater responsibility for its own security. We expect the country to take the same approach in respect of all forms of terrorism, including militants that use Pakistani territory to launch attacks inside Afghanistan. The government's efforts against the Pakistani Taliban represent a positive move. At the same time, civilians must be protected and international law complied with. The government should also be attentive to the need for humanitarian aid and reconstruction in the areas affected.
The new military strategy announced by President Obama, and even more clearly set out in the subsequent statement made by the foreign ministers of ISAF countries, has linked the sending of new troops to the primary aim of protecting the population and strengthening the capabilities of the security forces and the Afghan institutions. This welcome sea change takes into account the pointlessness, I would even go so far as to say the counterproductiveness, of a conventional type of military effort, focusing entirely on repressing Taliban guerrilla action.
However, in order to ensure that this new course is productive and sparks a transition towards a safe, prosperous, stable and therefore self-sufficient Afghanistan, it is very clear that the military dimension of the intervention by the international community must be accompanied by growing commitment on the civil and political front. On the one hand, we must promote economic development and strengthen the institutions, governance and the rule of law and, on the other, we must facilitate the process of internal reconciliation and help to stabilise the situation in Pakistan.
Europe's ability to make a substantial difference in the region nevertheless seems to be decidedly low considering the amount of human and financial resources committed. For this reason, we need to strengthen our undertaking, in other words, Europe's leadership, and make it more consistent and effective from the viewpoint of civil strategy and political undertaking. From this point of view, the action plan constitutes an important step forward, and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports it and demands its firm implementation.
I am putting together all the necessary bits of information. First of all, I have to say that it is turning out to be very difficult to get even the most basic data on how much was spent by the EU in Afghanistan after the 2001 occupation, where the EU aid arrived and how much of it can be accounted for. We know that almost EUR 1 billion is spent every year there, which is a big sum. The Afghan GDP is just EUR 6.9 billion. Our civilian aid therefore amounts to more than 20 percent of the yearly Afghan GDP, a figure that has the potential to reverse the destiny of the country if properly used.
The Afghan police were described to us recently as basically cannon fodder for the Taliban. I think many of us are still wondering, really, what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in. In terms of the international response, I welcome hearing the Commissioner talking about kick-starting cooperation and particularly mentioning India. The regional approach is important, and I look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension, such as Kashmir, which the Afghan Ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, we cannot afford to let the NATO-ISAF military mission in Afghanistan fail. With sufficient political will, the right military equipment and more troop numbers on the ground from all the Member States, NATO can defeat the Taliban and, of course, this must be coupled to a hearts-and-minds campaign as well. But next door, Pakistan is potentially a catastrophe in the making - a nuclear arms state plagued by Islamist radicalisation, corruption and feeble leadership, which, nevertheless, we have to help for strategic reasons.
My problem is with the lack of experience of our High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Cathy pass-the-bucket Ashton, with more than a few roubles in it, no doubt. We need someone more experienced. She has not had any Foreign Office experience; she has not been a foreign secretary and I do not think she even had a part-time job in a travel agents'. Come on! This is a delicate job; a job that needs to change things for the better and she is simply not experienced enough.
Madam President, at first sight, the Council's conclusions about Afghanistan appear to be a welcome contrast to the belligerent attitude of the United States and the United Kingdom. When looked at more closely, it is actually a mixture of naivety and complicity in their methods. The Council is thoroughly naive in trying to plant the delicate flower of Western democracy in the inhospitable soil of Afghan tribalism. The vertical divisions in society and the domination of tribal loyalties over personal judgment would make that impossible. It wants to remove corruption but simply does not understand that the bureaucratic model of objective judgment and financial and resource decisions would not stand a chance of being respected. This is not because Afghans are endemically dishonest but because Afghan tribal society sees looking after one's own family and tribe as a self-evident virtue.
The Council would like to counter the production of opium poppies. However, removing the Taliban from government was not the best way of reducing that production. The Taliban government reduced it by 90% but, since the invasion of Afghanistan, Afghanistan is again the world's leading opium producer. The report says 'Insecurity in Afghanistan cannot be addressed by military means alone'. That can only mean that military action has a legitimate part to play. In my view, it does not. We have had three failed wars against Afghanistan in the 19th and early 20th centuries; we really ought to have learnt our lesson.
I have two comments in this respect, Mrs Ashton. In 2005, I had the privilege to lead a Parliament electoral observation mission and I had the opportunity to meet the head of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Lieutenant-General Graziano, whose tour of duty in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is coming to an end. The 44 countries in ISAF today (28 of them NATO countries) constitute a heterogeneous force that is not providing an effective response in the current fight against insurgents.
In the face of such sacrifice, we in this House have our own duty to ensure that we do all we can to promote peace and prosperity for Afghanistan. If we are to take seriously the new Lisbon changes and a proper common EU foreign policy, there is no more urgent place to prove ourselves than in the sands of Afghanistan, first to ensure proper alignment of individual Member States' activities behind this new strategy and, second, to welcome High Representative Ashton's commitment today to have a formidable new double-hatted representative in place in Afghanistan very early in the New Year. This is both a litmus test of more efficient EU working under the treaty and a marker of our future resolve for Afghanistan.
Madam President, one in four children does not reach the age of five in Afghanistan, a country marked by social and health deficits, to which democratic and, above all, security deficits can be added. The likelihood of a confrontation with Pakistan provides an incentive for the Taliban to mobilise and highlights the need to address Afghanistan's problems from a regional perspective. We should add to that the fact that the inability to overcome the situation by military means alone predestines the European Union, with its extensive range of tools, to play a special role.
We must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the Afghan reformists. Why is Europe in Afghanistan? Because the United States said so, or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence? We need to strengthen the most effective Afghan structures, to prioritise investment in public services - education, health and transport - and to support good governance of local powers, since the culture of these countries requires us to reflect on the relevance of the nation state. Europe should, for instance, support Habiba Sarabi, the governor of Bamiyan Province. Her appointment is a first in the history of this country where, you will recall, we went in 2001 to help the female population.
I believe the European Union could make a useful, practical contribution, but this needs to be set in the context of the wider, international effort and it should be focused on some specific activities where EU involvement might add real value. It is too serious for EU posturing. In a document of over a dozen pages, I found only four brief references to the United States and, more significantly perhaps, only one to NATO, and it is after all the NATO ISAF mission which is central to the success of all endeavours.
Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy. We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy. Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education. The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here.
Firstly, as everyone says, we must hand over the keys to the Afghans themselves; we must ensure that the conflict is an Afghan conflict. Secondly, a dialogue must be established with all the insurgents, and note that I did not say 'with the Taliban', because the word 'Taliban' is very restrictive. Thirdly, a social level must be accepted that is not perfect. Let us not think that our European criteria are criteria that should be adapted to Afghanistan. We must accept that.
(DE) Madam President, if there is one thing that we really do not need in the bitter reality being experienced in Afghanistan, it is pretentious speeches. I am looking in your direction, Baroness Ashton, when I say that. You talked about the Member States being committed to the police training mission EUPOL. Is that really the case? If so, how can it be that we still do not even have the 400 police officers in place? That is a mixture of disingenuousness and absurdity. Are we being honest in what we say?
In the response to this debate from the Council and the Commission, I would like the joint strategy for these two countries to be explained more clearly, as we have to acknowledge, for example, that we have a thousand kilometre border in this region that cannot be controlled properly on either side, while the policies that we pursue on one side of this border will have direct effects on the other side. Therefore, what structures do we actually want to set up? How do we want to establish the dialogue between the Afghan and the Pakistani Governments? How can we ensure that our policies are accepted by the local people there? These are questions to which we still need answers, and I hope that we will get them.
Madam President, the plan of action on Afghanistan and Pakistan adopted last October is, in itself, a good document. Its aim is to create the conditions for returning responsibility from the international community, including the EU, to the Afghan state, with the former in a support role. The same is envisaged by the US in the security sector. It is hoped that the additional 30 000 US troops will create a situation in which responsibility could be handed over to the Afghan forces by 2011 when the US withdrawal will commence.
The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan. We cannot fail. In order to succeed, though, as has also been said, we need the support of our own citizens. This support is conditional on transparency and clarity. We must explain that our compatriots in Afghanistan are in serious danger, but we must also stress the importance of the mission there and that failure cannot be an option. As I have said, many important factors are at stake.
The Taliban governs de facto 80% of the country and the US military leadership as well as the European defence ministers are saying that this war cannot be won by military means. What, then, is the goal? A country that we do not have under control cannot be turned into a democracy and whatever else from the centre if that country has never had a centralised form of government. In other words, would it not make sense to concentrate on al-Qaeda and terrorism and then get out of there? These questions need to be answered.
Most importantly, we need to keep an eye on internal developments. When foreign military pressure leaves a country having trained soldiers and police officers who have no goal of their own, I have never known these soldiers and police officers to then leave behind the ideology of the civil war, which does indeed have a goal. It always wins! History shows this, too, and therefore I am deeply concerned that what we are doing here may lack continuity. We really should consider what sort of plan would enable us to get our troops out in a reasonable manner and, at the same time, to put an end to terrorism.
(PL) Madam President, I think the European Union action plan is going in the right direction, because our assistance must concern two areas. The first is an improvement in security. The second is an improvement in the conditions under which people live. It can be said that progress in the first area - concerning security - will have a beneficial effect on the conditions under which people live, while progress in the second area - concerning an improvement in the conditions under which people live - will foster an improvement in security.
(FR) Madam President, much has been said about the action plan on Afghanistan. Speaking for myself, I regret that the presentations given to us today did not place slightly more emphasis on the link between the EUPOL mission and the NATO mission in Afghanistan. This is a mission that we must carry out. The quantitative and qualitative problems that it is encountering are mainly due to the link with NATO and, in order to be effective, we must solve them as quickly as possible. I would have liked more to have been said about this.
My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability of which is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis for the entire region and for Afghanistan, too. I see, in the action plan, that cooperation with Pakistan is envisaged in the areas of counter-terrorism and security. In that country there is, as we know, a significant ideological and sometimes structural and organisational connection between radical Islamic movements that operate in Kashmir and at the Afghan border. I wanted to be sure that the methods, the nature and the timeframe of the assistance that we envisage are gauged properly, in order to prevent this connection from having extremely adverse and harmful effects.
(PL) Mr President, the situation in Afghanistan is, today, the most important problem facing international institutions and, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force, the European Union in particular. This challenge cannot be met without three elements in our strategy: firstly, the success of a very ambitious, two-year military mission, which must end in defeat of al-Qaeda and reception of part of the Taliban leadership to the government side. Secondly, stability in Pakistan and the entire region, including India - this is a second, key challenge - and thirdly, the need to build civil society. Thirty years of war is a huge problem. It is an uneducated society - over 90% of the people cannot read. In relation to this, a huge amount of social assistance is needed in order to build a state of law, good governance and social care.
(DE) Mr President, perhaps you would allow me, as a member of the Iran Delegation, to just make one brief comment. A while ago, the European Parliament in Brussels held a debate with the Iranian ambassador in Brussels. When asked why the number of death sentences in Iran had quadrupled since the Iranian President took office, he put it down to the increase in the drugs trade in the border region between Iran and Afghanistan. I wanted to mention this statement to you in order that, alongside corruption, this problem might also be given adequate consideration in the action plan.
Mr Kasoulides: the action plan takes the regional perspective as its starting point. It is absolutely central. Enormous emphasis is placed on good governance, combating corruption and the principles of the rule of law, and this is the work that is guiding the EU. In these areas, Afghanistan and Pakistan will need our support for a very, very long time to come. Mr Kasoulides is right in saying that we have not given sufficient attention to the drugs issue. We support the efforts being made, for example, the UNIDOC cooperation and technical assistance. This must continue. Most important of all, of course, is to support the work that the Afghan government is doing to create greater prosperity and good social governance.
To Mr Arlacchi, I would say that we agree that the efforts made to date have not been sufficiently coordinated. That is a problem for the EU, and that is why it is so important for us to have this plan now. The Swedish Presidency has also struggled hard during the autumn to obtain the type of information that you ask about - who is doing what, and how much - and to get an overall view of what is happening. We now have a better picture and we are very much looking forward to your report, which can help us as we move forward with this work, as well as to cooperating with you and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I would say to Mr Danjean that EUPOL is a very important element in our cooperation and the most important element for the Afghan Government as regards civil police work. It has emerged that there is very strong leadership in place. The qualities of EUPOL are recognised by all parties - the Afghans, the US and other parties. We have increased the workforce by 280 international personnel. We regret that the Member States have not been able to provide the 400 personnel that we require, and we are currently calling for further contributions because we want the Member States to be involved.
I agree with what honourable Members were saying about the importance of civilian issues. We have actually made significant progress; a number of Members were concerned about that. Just one example: in 2002, we had health care take-up support of around 7% of the population; it is now at 85% in 2009. I can give other examples; that is just one where I think we can absolutely show what we are doing and how effective it has been on the ground. I agree, too, with what was said by Members such as Mrs Lambert about education being absolutely core to what we do in terms of support for children and also of course in terms of training for employment with adults.
The funds: I am pleased to say that actually, these are very well-run funds. They are managed through the UN or through the World Bank and I think honourable Members receive a state of play report. The last one I have here is dated July 2009. For those who have not seen it, we can make sure you receive copies. It demonstrates in very clear terms exactly where the money is going, exactly what it is being spent on and what we hope to achieve by that. But I do agree that we need to be more efficient. There is always room for that. One of the challenges of my role is to bring together what is happening on the ground, to make it more coherent and make it work more effectively. A number of colleagues have mentioned the need to make sure we fulfil the commitments on EUPOL.
The new EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan is designed to implement the EU's strategic ambition to play an even more active imperialist role in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the area as a whole. In Pakistan, it is promoting a free trade agreement which will allow greater penetration of the euro-unifying monopolies in southern Asia. In Afghanistan, it is seeking to stabilise its presence even further, both independently, with the EUPOL policing mission in Afghanistan, and within NATO, with the development of the European Gendarmerie Force. Imperialist infighting for a share of the spoils is hotting up, despite the strategy of cooperation with the USA and NATO. The EU is endeavouring, with a package of money worth EUR 1 billion a year and various 'development programmes', to strengthen the position of European capital in plundering the occupied country and acquiring a springboard for the exploitation of the peoples and wealth in the area as a whole. At the same time, the 'democracy export' policy is trying to expand support for democracy to the imperialist occupying structure. The peoples cannot choose the 'better imperialist'. They must step up their fight against the plans of all the imperialists, in order to shake off the yoke of occupation in Afghanistan and the area as a whole.
The problems affecting Afghanistan and Pakistan are not confined only to these countries. They actually affect us all. The mission launched in Afghanistan must be brought to a conclusion. With this in mind, Romania is openly considering the possibility of increasing its involvement in this country, including reinforcements for training the army and providing medical and institutional support. Romania currently has 1 020 soldiers stationed in Afghanistan whose involvement in guaranteeing peace and stability is unanimously appreciated by our allies. We need to be involved not only on the military front, but also in strengthening the Afghan state's institutions, providing governance at local and regional level, combating corruption and drug trafficking, training police officers and providing technical assistance for agricultural development. In this regard, I would like to mention the announcement made by Catherine Ashton about increasing the funds which the European Commission is allocating for development in Afghanistan. The European Union's actions in Afghanistan and Pakistan must be coordinated. The situations in both countries are closely linked and success in one depends on the other. The European Union must continue its partnership with Pakistan and help this country in its battle against extremism and terrorism, as well as with regard to commercial relations and promoting human rights.
If there is a striking example anywhere in the world of the inability of the EU to adopt an independent position on a problem created by the United States, then it is the current unhappy situation in Afghanistan: a shattered infrastructure, several generations with minimal chances of obtaining an education, mediaeval conditions in terms of gender equality and the global standard for absolute corruption. It is a situation which, together with production of more than 70% of the world's opium output and increased activity from terrorist groups, shows the complete impotence of the occupying power. The well-known examples of injustice, even against elected representatives, together with the unlawful practices of the US administration, have created an unstable environment. The constant references to the lack of respect for human dignity under Soviet occupation are a futile attempt to cover up the current chaos and anarchy. With more than two million refugees in Pakistan and a porous border between the states, there are excellent preconditions for the penetration of armed groups into the southern and eastern parts of the country. The Pashtun tribes have long lived on both sides of the border and it is difficult in the current chaos to find out who comes from where. The EP resolution of 2008 describes this situation accurately but it must be said that the optimistic assertions are out of place. In the current situation, a strengthening of the military presence and further transfers of financial resources and teams of experts is completely nonsensical. The situation has deteriorated markedly over the past year and the optimistic assertions of the European Commission are not based on the current reality in Afghanistan.
It is imperative we take action to improve the situation in Afghanistan. In particular, important measures are: training of police officers, military personnel, people employed in the justice system and teachers, as well as combating the production of and trade in drugs. This will enable stabilisation of the social system in Afghanistan. Undoubtedly, it is also necessary to increase the military and police contingent and redouble efforts in the areas bordering Pakistan, to prevent the flow of arms and drugs between the two countries. It is already worth thinking about the direction in which the Afghan economy should develop in the future, so that the people will be able to give up growing poppies and trading opium. In a word, military and police action should be accompanied by civil measures: support in establishing the structures of an Afghan state and development aid.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, dear colleagues, Council President, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to discuss with you today our very important but also our very challenging relationship with Belarus. I think it is important because Belarus lies at a crossroads on our continent; and it is challenging because Belarus' own choices for its own future, and for its relationship with the EU, remain unclear. It still remains to be seen what they will be, so we will have to go on working with them.
However, to encourage democratic progress, the Council also extended the suspension of the restrictive measures. And the Council also took two further decisions to encourage Belarus to stay on the path of reforms. I very much welcome that the Commission can now start working on the visa facilitation issue, and on a shadow ENP action plan, the 'joint interim plan'. These steps provide an incentive for moves towards democracy in Belarus, which I am confident will be well understood, on the one hand, by the government, but, on the other hand, particularly by the people.
However, if Belarus wishes to come closer to the EU, it is clear it must show this through its actions. There must be an end to political prisoners and politically motivated prosecutions. Reform of the electoral legislation in line with OSCE/ODIHR recommendations is sorely needed. The liberty of the press, freedom of speech and of assembly should be permitted and become the norm. The European Union also encourages Belarus to abolish or declare a moratorium on the death penalty. We call for improved conditions for NGOs, civil society and human rights activists. All these steps could play their part in accelerating the development of a closer partnership between Belarus and the European Union.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, why has my political group insisted on having the resolution after the debate? Not only to express our support for the decision taken by the Council - because this is a wise decision and a proper decision and I agree with both your arguments - but the main reason is the increase in repression that has happened in Belarus quite recently. The resolution will refer to all those cases and, if any are abandoned during the drafting of the resolution, you may be sure they will be proposed as an amendment, either by the EPP in written form or by me in oral form tomorrow.
Why are these issues happening in Belarus? My private opinion is that it is partly due to the unconsidered - let me say, unwise - visits by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who met Alexander Lukashenko and praised him as a democratically elected leader but did not find time to meet with the opposition, and also, a little earlier, by the President of Lithuania, who has invited Lukashenko to Lithuania, in an ill-considered way, I would say.
We would like to see slightly more substance in the measures which the European Commission and Council are adopting, as well as slightly more focus on the actual citizens of Belarus, because this is the way to get the citizens themselves to rally behind the cause which we are trying to promote there in dialogue with the Belarusian authorities, namely, democratisation, openness and the holding of free and democratic elections. In present-day Europe, it is inconceivable that this process cannot happen in a European country.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to put forward one more proposal, because relations are really frozen between the Parliament and the authorities, but we do have relations with the opposition. My proposal is that I will propose to organise a conference, in Latvia or somewhere else, at which there would be participants from the authorities and from the opposition. The themes of the conference would be, firstly: energy, security, economy, transit problems, which, in Belarus, are very significant, as also for the EU; secondly: visa questions, neighbourhood questions regarding citizens; thirdly: the problems with the democratic situation, party problems and human rights; and fourthly: the real view from the Belarus side - how they see the Eastern Partnership in the near future. At the end of the day, I believe that this is one of the ways in which we could bring about a thaw in the frozen situation that we really do have. It has to be a two-way street, because with a one-way street, we will not succeed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, about two weeks ago, the Italian Prime Minister became the first Western Head of Government for many years to visit Belarus. He praised the work and policies of President Lukashenko and acknowledged the high election turn-out as being an expression of the high level of admiration and love of the people for their president. Unfortunately, he forgot to visit the opposition, which would otherwise be customary. The response was not to acknowledge the fact that steps had been taken towards liberalisation in Belarus; instead, the line taken towards the opposition became less tolerant. It resulted in repression and there was jostling, brawling and the like.
This is also why we have tabled this resolution today, in order to make it clear which powers and which civil society approaches we support and to clarify the fact that we will only be able to talk about a partnership - something that is, of course, as yet on ice - once we are also able to fully continue the human rights dialogue with Belarus. This means freedom of speech, freedom of expression, the freedom of the opposition to work, the allowance of opposition parties and so on. We believe that this is important and that it must define our partnership in the future. We hope that the European Union will find a common line here and that the future High Representative will also put a lot of effort into promoting it.
I have read through the draft resolutions on the issue in question carefully and I have listened with interest to the discussion. It seems to me that most of the drafts submitted attempt to make a positive change to the hitherto cool relations between the EU and Belarus. I regard the Eastern Partnership project as a good opportunity to bring about a significant improvement in our relations. I would like to emphasise firstly that in the economic sphere, a pragmatic approach predominates but it cannot be merely a one-sided process. The EU must also open up to Belarusian goods and services. Secondly, it is essential, in my opinion, to release rapidly the financial resources for Belarus within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. Thirdly, dialogue could be assisted through a relaxation of the EU's visa policy. Fourthly, we should give more support to the environmental component of our cooperation. We all know that Belarus suffered from the Chernobyl disaster and our assistance will be more than welcome. Although I understand the historical and political circumstances of Belarus, I firmly believe that the time has also come for Belarus to join the ranks of those countries that have outlawed the death penalty.
I therefore welcome the invitation to Belarus to join the Euronest joint parliamentary assembly on the clear condition of a 5+5 format for delegates, which is strongly supported by the European Parliament. On the other hand, the gross breach of principle in relation to official visits of EU member representatives is regrettable. One such principle which is required on an official visit to Belarus is a meeting with the opposition. It is precisely this principle that was flagrantly breached through the absence of such a meeting in the recent visit by the leader of an influential Member State of the EU. Behaviour of this sort deals a blow to our efforts, damages the good name of the European Union and its institutions and definitely does not help to strengthen democracy in Belarus.
When the new EU countries joined the Schengen Agreement two years ago, the remains of the Berlin wall, metaphorically speaking, shifted to the East. Whereas before, residents of Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Belarus, often related, were able to travel to each other without any taxes, now Belarusians must pay almost half their monthly salary for a Schengen visa. Such bureaucratic and financial walls must be torn down as soon as possible. On the other hand, Minsk's actions to delay the agreement with Lithuania and other states on facilitated passage for border inhabitants casts doubt over the authorities' goodwill.
I am convinced that both in the opposition and government camps, many people are waiting for us to talk about free elections. They, too, are waiting for this signal. I know this from my own experience. They deserve a clear and plain answer. We are fighting for Belarus to have free elections, and for Belarus to be a free partner in Europe. Yesterday, we were able to obtain a declaration from Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on the Sarkozy Plan, for which I thank her.
(NL) Mr President, at the start of this year, on Wednesday 14 January to be precise, I also had the honour of taking part in a debate in this House on Belarus, at which Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner was also present. At the end of the parliamentary year, it is natural to look at whether there have been any significant changes in EU-Belarus relations; and, to my mind, 2009 has been characterised by the status quo between Minsk and Brussels. What conclusions should the European institutions draw from this? First of all, the danger remains of President Lukashenko's regime in Belarus simply continuing to vacillate between Moscow and Brussels, or between feigned integration with Russia and feigned rapprochement with the European Union. On the one hand, there is Europe's economic affectivity; on the other, the desire of the Belarusian political elite to consolidate its power. The latest changes in position at the top political level in Minsk point to a harder line.
(PL) The experiment with a thaw in relations between the Union and Belarus continues to yield ambiguous results. Political pressure from the European Union is, therefore, an essential condition for maintenance of the very weakly outlined direction of change in Minsk. Opening channels of communication with the authorities must go hand-in-hand with rejection of the undemocratic parliament in Minsk. We must also take scrupulous care that free Belarusians do not feel rejected, and so the thoughtless omission of meetings with representatives of the opposition is extremely irresponsible.
(PL) Mr President, we have found ourselves in a situation which points to a kind of schizophrenia in our contacts with Belarus. For European leaders are talking with the President and with a Belarusian Government which represents the Belarusian Parliament and political system. This is good. However, we do not want to speak to a parliament which was returned in elections which were badly run and were neither free nor transparent, because we have our principles. This schizophrenia must come to an end at some point, and this should be said clearly.
Mr President, as a long-term Belarus watcher, it is important that the EU remains engaged with Belarus, which is a medium-sized European country and which is becoming increasingly self-isolated and turning itself into a kind of Cuba of Europe. President Lukashenko, who is a quintessentially Homo sovieticus type, nevertheless understands fully what power politics are all about and therefore we need to have a reasonable EU-Belarus trade and political contact and relationship. I therefore do agree that the targeted sanctions need to be eventually lifted and a PCA eventually ratified.
(PL) There has been talk here of the need for youth and cultural exchange between the Union and Belarus. I am afraid this will be very difficult. On 3 December, Tatiana Szapućko, spokesperson for the opposition organisation Young Front, had her name struck off the list of students at the Faculty of Law of the Belarusian State University. Why was her name removed? For taking part in a forum on the Eastern Partnership in Brussels. The university authorities took the view that she had left without their consent, and for this she was thrown out of the university.
Perhaps for a woman in Belarus, this is not all that dangerous, but for men thrown out of university in Belarus, the results can be much more painful, because military service there is treated as a punishment, as a substitute for prison. There are young soldiers, such as Franek Wieczorka, head of the youth organisation called the Belarusian Youth Front, and Ivan Szyła, also from the organisation Young Front, who are being persecuted during military service, where they are cut off from access to information, and this is treated as a punishment. We should fight against this and should support those who are punished in this way.
This dual approach towards Belarus - the 'stick and carrot', as I think Mr Tannock called it - is hopefully the one that will succeed. It shows that we are truly committed, we stuck out our hands. We can show Mr Lukashenko and the Belarus regime that, if you move towards democracy, if you move towards respecting international values, there is another way for you. There is a way towards European integration; there is a way towards engagement with the European Union, towards visa facilitation and deepening of the Eastern Partnership.
The EU is, in principle, ready to work closely with Minsk and support urgently needed political and economic reforms. Should there be significant steps from the Belarusian leadership in terms of democratisation, the EU would be prepared to see Belarus as a full member of the Eastern Partnership. In the meantime, the EU is, and will be, urging Belarus to take further irreversible steps towards democratic standards, without which our relationship cannot develop to its full potential. I sincerely hope that in 2010, we will be in a position to engage gradually and intelligently with Belarus and offer the Belarusian people a vision and tangible benefits of a close relationship with the EU.
What could the EU do for Belarus? What is on offer? The Commission believes that the most productive approach to Belarus will be one based on pragmatism. Progressive EU engagement with Belarus needs to reflect positive steps by Belarus itself, but we also need to show flexibility. The November 2009 conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) allow the EU to offer incentives to Belarus for steps we want to see, while remaining true to our principles. This is what I mean by pragmatism.
Democratic values and respect for human rights and individual freedoms provide the bedrock on which the EU has been built. As our basic objective is to help neighbouring countries become democratic and Belarus is one of the last countries in Europe with an authoritarian regime, I believe that we should set very clear, stringent political conditions for Belarus before any political contact is established. Belarus has carried out some reforms, but they pale into insignificance in relation to the problems which exist, especially with regard to respect for human rights, press freedom and freedom of expression. Support must be given to the activists campaigning for respect for human rights and individual freedoms. I support the idea of establishing contacts with the opposition and am particularly in favour of individual contacts between citizens from the EU and Belarus. As a result of this, the citizens from Belarus will be able to speak freely with people who share democratic values. This would contribute to the development of civil society and facilitate a process of democratisation, which would enjoy popular support and be initiated by the people itself. This is the only way that a healthy democracy can be created where everyone's rights are respected. Therefore, the use of sanctions as a means of exerting pressure needs to be combined with facilitating contacts between citizens from the EU and Belarus.
I would like to welcome Belarus's constructive involvement in the Eastern Partnership process, as well as the fact that a human rights dialogue has been initiated between the EU and Belarus. During the past year, positive processes have been initiated in the country with the release of political prisoners, but we see that this process has since come to a standstill. This is due to problems with the registration of political parties and the authorisation of independent media and civil organisations. As a result, the EU was obliged to extend the travel restriction measures. I sincerely hope that Belarus will continue along the path of positive change it embarked on last year, thereby offering the opportunity for the EU also to be able to respond positively. Until then I think it is also important to consider whether we can move forward in the area of visa facilitation, as human contacts can make a major contribution to more political openness and the democratisation process as well.
In the outcome of the European Council of 17 November 2009, we read that new possibilities for dialogue and increasing cooperation between the European Union and Belarus have emerged. Wanting to encourage the authorities in Belarus to carry out reforms, the Member States agreed to a temporary lifting of sanctions on freedom of movement which had been applied to high-ranking representatives of the Belarusian authorities. The European Commission is preparing a directive to make it easier for Belarusians to obtain EU visas and an agreement on readmission.
Mr President, the Presidency attaches great importance to discussing with the European Parliament the highly problematic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Infringements of human rights, and particularly increased sexual and gender-related violence, are a huge problem. It is high time for a debate on the situation in the country, particularly in view of the recent UN report. The report from the UN group of experts emphasises that a number of armed groups active in the country are supported by a well-organised network that is partly based within the European Union.
This support has been manifested in various ways, including the appointment of the first EU Special Representative for the region as far back as 1994. Both military and civil ESDP instruments have been used. We have had Operation Artemis in Ituri province, the temporary EUFOR deployment in the period leading up to the 2006 elections, as well as EUSEC RD Congo for reform of the defence forces and EUPOL RD Congo for reform of the police. Bearing all this in mind, there have been both positive and negative developments. Diplomatic relations between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have been restored. That is to be welcomed. Peace agreements with most of the armed groups in the eastern part of the country were signed in 2008 and 2009. These now have to be implemented.
The situation is unstable in many ways. Many armed groups in the east are in the process of being integrated into the army and some uncertainty pervades this integration work. Military operations are continuing against other armed groups, including the FDLR and the Lord's Resistance Army. These groups are directly responsible for targeting civilians and for an enormous amount of human suffering. At the same time, armed groups are re-emerging in other parts of the country. The eastern part of the country remains an area in which international law and human rights are being infringed. There are high levels of murder, acts of violence and sexual attacks. These crimes are spreading throughout the country on an alarming scale, despite President Kabila's announcement of a so-called zero tolerance policy.
Every effort has been made to prevent the worst. Promoting a political agreement, firstly between the DRC and Rwanda, and then between the Congolese Government, the CNDP and the other armed groups has made it possible, in the short term, to defuse the ticking time bomb of violence, although its potential for destabilisation today remains intact. It remains intact because the underlying causes have been addressed superficially and on the basis of a short-term, purely political rationale. Being faced with only poor solutions, the international community has opted for the least serious one; that is not a criticism, just an obvious fact, an observation.
So far, the hasty integration of the CNDP into such an ineffective and totally chaotic army as the FARDC; the obtaining, by Bosco Ntaganda, of increased autonomous power resulting from the implementation of a parallel chain of command within the FARDC, for which the irregular payment of the soldiers and the absence of any form of discipline or hierarchy provides fertile ground; MONUC's insufficiently controlled and gauged support for the military operations against the FDLR; and the non-existent response to the demands of the Rwandophone minorities are factors that are liable to create even more serious problems than those which we faced a year ago - problems that neither Rwanda nor the DRC will be capable of managing any longer.
The situation has scarcely improved against this backdrop: the humanitarian crisis continues without any obvious signs of improvement, as do the human rights violations, the sickening trend of violence, indeed of sexual atrocities, the impunity for all manner of crimes, and the pillaging of natural resources. One need only read the United Nations and the Human Rights Watch reports that I mentioned to understand the scale of this never-ending tragedy. It is clear that the actions aimed at preventing the FDLR from doing harm must continue, but not at any price, not without first having done everything it takes to minimise the risks that military pressure entails for innocent civilians.
This requires better planning, the redefining of priorities and greater protection of the populations by MONUC, which is the main task stipulated in its mandate. The conditions in which MONUC may operate must also be clear and unambiguous. This is not about calling for MONUC to withdraw or disengage. A hasty withdrawal by MONUC would be disastrous, as it would create an even greater vacuum: the recent events in the Equator region, which are essentially one more symptom of the Congolese disease, prove this.
Clearly, it is also important to stop the political and economic collusion from which the FDLR continue to benefit in the region and elsewhere in the world, including in our Member States. The FDLR's campaign is not a political campaign, but a criminal act of which the Congolese population is the main victim, and this is how the campaign and all those who are directly or indirectly associated with it must be treated. This is why a firmer stance is needed against all forms of trafficking. At the same time, beyond the disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, reintegration and resettlement (DDRRR) process, the Rwandan and Congolese authorities must be more perceptive with regard to individuals who are not necessarily criminals.
That being said, the solution to a large part of the problem must also be found in the DRC. I am, of course, thinking of the local origins of the conflict. In this regard, the agreements of 23 March must be applied in full, otherwise, sooner or later, we will see the frustrations of the local populations gain the upper hand. This is absolutely essential if the stabilisation efforts and the will to revive economic activity in the Kivus are to succeed. At that point, the international community really will have a role to play.
The second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance. While it is true that, given the extent of its problems, the DRC cannot do everything at once, it clearly must demonstrate a solid political will if it is to have a chance of success. Parliament raised the issue of impunity. This is a good example, because it is a matter of political will and it also underpins the whole business of affirming the rule of law. The problem is that things cannot be done in isolation. The rule of law also requires a reform of the security sector and real progress in economic governance terms.
However, Congo does not have to be a heart of darkness. It can be a normal country. There are normal countries in Africa, where rich natural resources serve the good of the people, the public authorities care for the common good, children go to school, and sex is associated with love and not rape and violence. I am certain that the key to success in Kivu and the whole of Congo is the quality of government. Without democratic, just, honest and effective government, peace and justice cannot be achieved. Without responsible government, the country's riches serve only a few, leaders look after themselves, schools are empty and violence becomes a part of everyday life.
I remember the optimism of 2006. I, myself, was an observer during the elections, and we were all pleased because, after a gap of 40 years, democratic elections were taking place in that large and important country. However, our optimism has turned out to be premature. It is hard not to ask the question why this has happened, and why the elections did not result in a better life for Congo. In my opinion, it is a question of money, as Mrs Malmström and Mr De Gucht have said. They spoke about the illegal use of resources and how this is used to finance arms, which serves to continue and escalate the conflict. If we can put a stop to this, we will be closer to our goal.
It is reported that there are 1 460 000 internally displaced people, most of them facing violence, and let me give a voice to those who do not have a voice, those who suffer such violence. The armed actors in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have perpetrated gender-based violence through various forms, including sexual slavery, kidnapping, forced recruitment, forced prostitution and rape. The Congolese victims of sexual violence include women, men and boys who have also suffered rape, sexual humiliation and genital mutilation.
Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have always kept a close eye on events taking place in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite the promising progress made thanks to the recent rapprochement between Rwanda and the DRC - a rapprochement without which there will be no solution in the east and which must therefore be consolidated - despite the agreements of 23 March between Kinshasa and the Congolese rebel group, which the Commissioner spoke about, the situation in the east remains deeply concerning.
Lastly, I believe that we must revisit the Amani programme. This programme offers the possibility of building a dialogue and peace everywhere, since these alone are the guarantees of lasting reconstruction. In any case, I welcome your intervention, which I broadly support, and I hope that the European Union will remain active. This is crucial, even though, regrettably, it did not want to put a force together. That would have been a possibility a little less than a year ago. Nevertheless, I believe that European Union action is crucial.
Mr President, in no other country in the world have there, as yet, been more European Security and Defence Policy operations than in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As always, the question arises of whose security is being defended. Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population, the women and children? The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed, tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled - atrocities in which the government forces supported by the EU were involved.
So what is being defended in the Congo? Humanity? Or are we safeguarding a regime that, between 2003 and 2006, for example, concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms, not a single one of which was judged by international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people? President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms. This change was suspended when the war escalated once again. My question is, why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo - the FDLR - reputed to be in Germany? I am referring here to the resolution that I have tabled on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left.
The humanitarian crisis is deepening with every day that passes. The lack of security in the area means that humanitarian organisations can no longer provide any intervention. More than 7 500 cases of rape and sexual violence have been recorded in the first nine months of this year alone, which is more than the figure for the whole of last year. All these incidents have taken place against a backdrop of famine and extreme poverty affecting millions of people. The blame for this whole tragedy lies both with the Congolese army and Rwandan rebels. Unfortunately, however, there are indications that the UN troops in the Congo bear a large share of the responsibility as they are allowing serious violations of human rights to take place. This is why I believe that the European Union must discuss urgently how the UN forces in the Congo are going to achieve properly the mission objectives that have been assigned them.
(NL) Mr President, I have just listened to the speech by Mr Mölzer, who has now left, the gist of which was: it is so hopeless that we should just give up and concentrate on our own neighbours. I must say that, if one really looks at the situation, one is almost tempted to call it a day. On the other hand, I then think of the group of women who visited us here last month, to whom Mrs Durant also referred, and I wonder whether we could look them in the eye and tell them that we are simply giving up, or that it is not one of our priorities, or that we mean to just adopt yet another resolution and consider our job done. When I think of those women, of their despair and bitterness and the feeling that they have been left in the lurch, I do consider it eminently possible to hold such a debate.
The resolution contains very many positive elements, and I hope that we shall indeed lend force to them with action, but I just wanted to emphasise one aspect. We frequently talk about rape, or sexual violence, but in fact, these terms scarcely cover the reality of the situation. The women with whom we spoke said it goes far beyond attacks on individuals; it is not individual violence but rather an attack on the community, aimed at destroying its fabric. It is my view, therefore, that there is now a most urgent need for us not only to take action, put an end to impunity, pay on the nail and provide the resources for the actions we have announced, but also to show that we are extending a hand to the people there, that we stand in solidarity with them and are not leaving them in the lurch; that we are shouldering our moral responsibility.
(RO) At the present juncture, which also coincides with the moment when the United Nations is preparing to announce the extension of MONUC's mandate, I think we need to reflect on the international community's actions in light of the situation on the ground in the RDC, which is, unfortunately, continuing to deteriorate. As is also borne out by the experience of Operation Kimia II conducted by the Congolese army with MONUC's support, military success is not sufficient when the cost in humanitarian terms is high and if it is paid through the suffering of the Congolese civilian population.
I believe that the recent military operations conducted against the FDLR have had disastrous consequences, resulting, which we should be aware of, in large-scale human rights violations and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. On the other hand, impunity offers an invitation to commit these crimes over and over again. I believe that protection of the civilian population must be the number one priority. The European Parliament must strongly assert that acts of violence, particularly sexual violence, and human rights violations in general, as well as the abuses committed in Kivu, must stop immediately, along with the climate of impunity.
(ES) Mr President, other Members have already spoken of the tragic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. They have spoken of the millions of deaths and cases of rape and abuse against the civilian population. They have spoken of the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and of cooperation by the European Commission on the ground. Less has been said, however, about the need to control the illegal flow of raw materials, such as diamonds, gold and other products, to the rest of the world. These products are being 'laundered' through legitimate accounts and companies in our own countries or in the United States.
(FR) Mr President, in the light of the recent alarming reports coming out of North and South Kivu, and in the light of the extremely violent nature of the attacks perpetrated against civilians and, more specifically, against women, children and the elderly, urgency - a word so often used by the European Union and by the entire international community with regard to Congo - seems to me to be an immediate requirement. Everything must be done to ensure the protection of the civilian populations. The mandate given to the MONUC personnel on the ground will no doubt be extended, but it absolutely must be re-evaluated and strengthened, too, so that this rising tide of violence can be stemmed.
For many years now, international communities, NGOs and Congolese women have made constant efforts to combat the use of sexual assault as a weapon of war. Today, systematic and widespread use is made of this weapon in peaceful areas, and always with total impunity. I welcome the recent determination shown by the Congolese authorities to put a stop to this impunity, but this zero tolerance policy must be ambitious - all perpetrators of violence, without exception, will have to answer for their actions - and truly effective.
(FR) Mr President, the humanitarian situation in the east of the Republic of Congo - and, more specifically, in the eastern province and in the Kivu region - is disastrous, as we now know. The security situation of the civilian populations deteriorated following, among other things, the joint military operations conducted by the Congolese army and the Ugandan and Rwandan troops against all the rebel armed groups, operations which left countless massacres and human rights violations in their wake.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all the speakers have rightly emphasised the terrible situation in which the Congolese people, and especially Congolese women, are living in the east of that country. They have talked about the rapes and the barbaric acts that these people suffer and about the murders of which they are victims. Rather than talk about them, however, I invite you to visit the UNICEF and V-Day websites, which obviously say all there is to say about this subject.
Today, I am going to talk to you about the real consequences that these barbaric acts have for Congo; I am going to talk about the physically and mentally wounded women, who must be cared for; and I am going to talk about the murdered women, who will no longer be able to contribute to the economic development of Congo and whose unborn children will never be able to contribute to it either. I would also like to talk about the spread of AIDS, a trauma suffered by the entire Congolese population, which paints a negative picture of Congo to the international community - one, in short, of a country that is getting into more and more of a mess.
(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I, in turn, would like to refer to the tragedy of the sexual violence suffered by women in the DRC and, more specifically, in the east of the country. The phenomenon is not new. It is extremely complex. It is multidimensional. The physical and psychological suffering of the victims is made even worse by this social exclusion, which is tragic for them. President Kabila's zero tolerance policy is today tentatively beginning to bear fruit, but everyone is aware that only a global strategy can combat this scourge in the long term.
I know, Commissioner, that the Commission is already intervening, and is doing so via a multitude of projects and budgets, too. However, faced with these figures and with the terrible, dreadful accounts we are hearing, do you not think that we in this House are entitled to have our doubts about the results of this strategy? Women, Commissioner, are the main vehicle for peace and reconstruction in a country. They are the future of Congo. How do you intend to act more effectively and more promptly?
(DE) Mr President, in November 2009, there was an exchange of ambassadors between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo - a tiny ray of hope for this ravaged country and its ravaged people. In addition, the leader of the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda was arrested. These are both signs of improvement in the situation in eastern Congo. My question for the Commission is this: what measures are you intending to take to bring about further rapprochement between Congo and Rwanda?
With regard to the UN mandate, a great deal has been said here today about taking all forms of action. Let us be frank: if there is a UN mandate, then it should clearly be for the protection of those who are oppressed, tortured, violated and abused, in particular, the women and children of this country. In this regard, one thing must be quite clear: if a UN mandate is issued - and we Austrians are a bit restrictive in this area - then it should be consistent and, if need be - including for the protection of the oppressed people - those on the ground must be armed.
(SV) Mr President, it is almost impossible to grasp the terrible statistics being mentioned, and yet we know that they are true. Nonetheless, there is a feeling - perhaps shared by many - that when it comes to the poorest of poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa, our commitment is not as strong or as specific as it should be. There has been mention of military power. I think we all realise that we have to fight poverty and corruption if we are to make any progress towards relieving and improving the situation of this country's population, which has suffered so appallingly.
Taken together, the contributions of the Member States and the Commission make the EU one of the largest contributors of aid to the region, and therefore we can have an influence. If stability is to be maintained in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the region, however, it is crucial that the standard of living of the Congolese population is improved, that human rights are safeguarded, and that vigorous action is taken against corruption in order to establish a society based on the principles of the rule of law.
As far as the Council is concerned, the mandate of the two ESDP missions was reviewed following the investigation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo in early 2009 with a view to helping to combat precisely this kind of sexual violence. As a result, EUPOL DR Congo is to send two multidisciplinary teams to the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, with a mandate covering the entire country. These teams will provide various types of specialist expertise in areas such as the investigation of crimes and the control of sexual violence. Recruitment for these missions is currently under way.
Let me just read to you some sections of the mandate adopted by the UN Security Council at the beginning of last year. It states that 'the Council also decided that MONUC shall, from the adoption of this resolution, have the mandate, in this order of priority, working in close cooperation with the Government of the DRC in order to ensure, firstly, the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel and facilities; to ensure the protection of civilians, including humanitarian personnel, under imminent threat of physical violence, in particular, violence emanating from any of the parties engaged in the conflict'.
In the Congo, you see one of the answers. We have allowed Bosco Ntaganda to take over the leadership of the CNDP from Laurent Nkunda, although there is a warrant against Bosco Ntaganda, and you see what happens. There is no such thing as a free lunch. You cannot choose between, on the one hand, management of a political crisis and, on the other hand, putting international criminal justice into practice. I think that, as the European Parliament and as the European Commission, the pre-eminence should go to the due application of international criminal justice.
The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Buşoi, Heide Rühle, Adam Bielan and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the transposition of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications (O-0108/2009/rev.2 - B7-0217/2009).
I was going to have welcomed Mr McCreevy here and thanked him for his work previously, so perhaps you will pass on our good wishes for what might have been his final appearance here. Nevertheless, I am particularly pleased that Mr Barnier has joined us as a very active member of my committee to hear this, because this is a dossier which will be very much in his in-tray, assuming of course that the Parliament approves his nomination and the Commission moves forward. It is nevertheless very good that he is here.
The free movement of professionals and the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications are among the flagship issues that my committee is most concerned about in the whole construction of the single market. It is very appropriate that we are discussing this question to the Commission this morning, which is essentially to ask for an update on the progress in transposing the revised directive that my committee worked on back in 2004-2005, and on how that is actually being implemented by the Member States. It is also very timely because Professor Monti came to our committee on Monday to talk about his mission for the President of the Commission on the future direction of the internal market. He made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is actually not the lack of legislation, but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market.
In the case of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, as the text of our question quite clearly sets out, we already know that a significant number of problems in relation to recognition of professional qualifications are encountered by citizens across the European Union. It has one of the highest levels of complaints in the Solvit mechanism that we very much support at member government level. Many people feel frustrated by the absence of clear decisions and also by the lack of contact between authorisation bodies in different Member States. One of the things that our own research has done, and this committee commissioned research on this topic, is to demonstrate the fact that there is nothing like enough coordinated activity on helping people to recognise their rights under mutual recognition. The other aspect is that it is also clear from the work we and others have done that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European qualifications framework. There are serious questions that we need to ask about the mechanism, about how simple it is to access and about how effective it is in practical terms. We know from the statistics and the information - and I am sure we will hear from the Commission shortly - that transposition of this instrument has been delayed in just about every Member State. It has taken much longer than people expected to bring this into operation, and that of itself raises concerns about the complexity of the instrument itself.
Just to pull all these things together in the context of the work of the Internal Market Committee over the next five years, I am delighted that, I think, all the coordinators of the committee are here today and I want to thank them for the work they have done, together with myself, on shaping the forward agenda for this committee. This question of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just a one-off. It is part of our feeling that the role of our committee is to continue to investigate, to promote and to make recommendations about the future evolution of the key legislations, the key building blocks of the single market.
I had expected that the problems would lie in the practical management of the directive. That is the main subject of the forthcoming investigations: to find out where there are specific local problems and to discover what is actually happening. There has already been a reference to the fact that 20% of the complaints to SOLVIT concern this subject. This is a very serious matter. Mr Harbour rightly pointed out - and I do not want to repeat what he said - the importance of this problem for the internal market from an economic perspective.
It is important for us to acknowledge that there will inevitably be problems. It is a complex matter, it takes time to implement and different cultures and traditions are involved, particularly with regard to the professions and the concepts of quality and qualifications within those professions. Therefore, it is not possible to recognise every qualification from one country in another country without question. For me and for us, this is less about dealing with the individual cases of hardship which will inevitably occur and more about investigating - and this is where SOLVIT comes in - whether there are faults in the structures or in the system and whether and how improvements can be introduced.
Moving on to the matter in hand, ladies and gentlemen, this is all about the citizenship of the Union, about the people who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union and to practise their professions where they live and where they choose to work. We have put this legislation in place so that this will become easier and so that the process of recognising professional qualifications can genuinely be brought up to date. I find it simply appalling that the Member States in many cases have not taken the necessary steps to implement this legislation and to ensure that citizens really have this freedom of movement. There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect.
I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament. We must ensure that the European professional card, which we have proposed, is introduced. This will put into citizens' hands something that will allow them to move throughout Europe. There are organisations which are attempting to do this. However, I feel it is important to ask the European Commission whether this is an area in which it could become involved in order to speed this process up.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we all agree on the objective here. Of course, we all want the citizens of Europe to be able to move about freely and to exercise their professions. The question is why this directive has still not been properly implemented after four or now nearly five years. I believe it would make sense if the committee was involved not only in drawing up and enacting the legislation, but if it also carried out an analysis afterwards of the reasons why transposition is delayed in this way.
The Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is not the only directive which is causing problems. When there are so many cases in the Court of Justice of the European Union, when there are so many complaints procedures and when SOLVIT is so heavily involved with this subject, this should act as a wake-up call for us. We must look more closely at the reasons behind this. There are a number of causes. On the one hand, it is always very easy to say that the Member States are responsible for the delay. Protectionism is doubtless another of the reasons. The different cultures and legal systems certainly also play a role. What effect does European legislation have on these differing legal systems? That is another issue that we will have to address.
Mr President, the crisis which has affected the European Union in recent months has shown irrefutably how important the internal market is for the functioning of the entire Union. We will not finish building it without introducing a certain freedom for people to migrate, which is guaranteed, among others, by the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Therefore, it is a sad and disturbing fact that, four years after adoption of the directive, it still is not in force in four countries, and none of the Member States adopted it before the deadline contained in the directive, 20 October 2007.
In relation to this, my first question to the European Commission is as follows: has the Commission not been too passive over the last four years, and what exactly did the Commission do so that all the countries would manage to transpose the directive in time? Secondly, I would like to ask when the Commission will publish a report evaluating transposition of the directive, and what will be used as the basis for the conclusions in the report? The Services Directive should be implemented at the end of the year. Today, in Parliament, we know already that many countries will not manage to pass laws about this in time. I would like to ask what connection the Commission sees between these two documents?
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission for presenting its opinion to us. However, I would also like to point out that, following the interinstitutional agreement between the Commission and Parliament, and I have seen this happen with the Services Directive, which we discussed in Brussels months ago, Parliament has a right to demand that the Commissioner responsible should be here to answer difficult questions. I do not think that we can resolve this issue with this Commission and there is no point in trying to do so.
On behalf of Parliament, I would like to explain to the representative of the Commission who is here that we believe that this part of the interinstitutional agreement is extremely important. Why is that? Not for reasons of mere formalism, but because this is a very important political question for the citizens of the European Union. Mr Bielan has just referred to the Services Directive, which can only function if professional qualifications are recognised by both sides. It is of great importance, but many people also connect it with a feeling of helplessness, if they have the impression that their employer is making use of discrepancies in the cross-border mutual recognition of professional qualifications simply to reduce their earnings.
These people feel abandoned and helpless. I have seen this myself in a number of cases here on the border between Germany and France. However, this is obviously not the only problem area. It is true that we cannot resolve all the difficulties overnight and that this process will remain an ongoing issue in future, as Mr Lechner, the rapporteur, has said. Nevertheless, it is our job to show the citizens that we take their concerns seriously and, in my opinion, this also includes the Commission attaching sufficient importance to this issue.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive. In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic. Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text. Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account. The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens.
(PL) Mr President, if we want our citizens to be mobile - and this is what the European economy needs - they have to be sure that when they gain their qualifications, for example, in Poland, they will not have problems with recognition of these qualifications in any Member State. I understand the scale of the problem perfectly. The 800 regulated professions of which Mr Samecki spoke, together with numerous regulations of these professions at national and regional level, are a considerable challenge for the administrations of the Member States. However, the challenge for our citizens who are having problems with recognition of their qualifications is, principally, how to find their feet in the complexities of the entire system. This is confirmed by data from Solvit, and this is why the problem with implementing the directive in time is only one aspect of our discussion.
We should not, however, forget that many problems are emerging because there is a lack of trust in Member States towards the education and training systems in other Member States. We lack, finally, cooperation, resources and the engagement of national administrations. The introduction of a European professional card is a good idea, and we had the opportunity to discuss this during the previous term of the European Parliament. Such a card must, however, facilitate the flow of people, and not make it more difficult. Introduction of this card - and I would like to stress this very strongly - should not become another barrier in the internal market.
Ladies and gentlemen, in just under ten days, the deadline for transposition of the Services Directive expires. I mention this because it is also important in the context of our debate today. These two directives complement each other in certain respects. Transposition of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications cannot be called a success, and so I will permit myself once again to appeal from this place for an intensification of work on both directives, because without them, we will not make progress with the internal market.
(MT) The biggest issue affecting the proper enforcement of this directive is the Member States' lack of trust in each others' systems. The Member States' disinterest in collaborating with each other is also reflected in the incoherent manner in which they perceive the internal market information system. Every Member State claims to use the system, but the frequency of use varies in accordance with the purpose for which it is used. It is impossible for an information exchange system to work properly when the Member States do not use it in the same way. It is necessary to have a full compilation of data which is updated regularly and it is also necessary to create a point of reference for all Member States, where each Member State inputs all necessary data which will allow the concrete application of the directive.
Leaving aside the difficulties inherent in the Belgian institutional system with regard to the transposition of the various European directives, it seems that the directive that we are discussing here is particularly complex. That has already been mentioned. Belgium is not the only country to be affected by the non-transposition, poor transposition or partial transposition of directives. That is why, in the interests of professionals, I call on the European Commission to help those Member States that are having difficulties. Professionals should be able to benefit from the free movement of persons and freedom of establishment which, I would point out, constitute the main objective of this directive.
Mr President, let us get straight to the point here. The failure of Member States to get their act together in terms of the recognition of qualifications is costing us jobs. The failure of Member States to actually take this seriously enough is a serious issue. Our level of cross-border trade for what is supposed to be a single market is nowhere near what it should be. We are in the process of rebuilding the European economy, and part of this move must involve ways to enhance cross-border trade and make labour more mobile than it is now.
In general, I would like to refer to a couple of selected questions. First of all, we should underline that the Commission has been supporting Member States in preparing the transposition of the directive. Where the transposition period has lapsed, we have also been vigorous in enforcing transposition. In 2007, we published a transposition guide. Then we developed the internal market information system, which is now used quite intensively by all Member States, and we also published a code of conduct on administrative practices in June this year.
One stated goal of this directive is to implement fully the current legal provisions concerning the freedom of movement of professionals within the EU. The free movement of professionals has already been adopted in Directive 2005/36/EC. However, problems are occurring repeatedly, particularly in regions near national borders. Many people in the region I come from work in Luxembourg, Belgium or France. I receive numerous enquiries from citizens who cross into one of the neighbouring countries to work. These enquiries often relate to the recognition of professional qualifications. This situation must change. Agreements have been reached by the professional organisations for specific professions, but this does not help in every case and all too often, citizens have to fight to have their qualifications recognised. It becomes particularly difficult when a particular country does not have a specific profession or that profession is organised differently, for example, physiotherapists or people with a PhD in business administration. At the same time, many areas are short-staffed. Nurses or toolmakers, for example, must, in future, have better opportunities on our labour markets and, above all, the internal market must function effectively as far as work is concerned. We need a transparent, simple and clear recognition procedure.
In relation to your question whether the Commission intends to publish a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, at the current stage, a separate White Paper on Territorial Cohesion is not foreseen. Policy conclusions resulting from the public debate on the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion will instead be incorporated in the comprehensive cohesion policy legislative package for post-2013 prepared in the context of the Fifth Cohesion Report which, according to the new treaty, is due for submission in 2010.
Mr President, Commissioner, today's debate primarily concerns the substantive assessment of the cohesion policy and the way ahead for this policy. Of course, the European Parliament wants a financial mid-term review. The cohesion policy and the use of the funds now and in this subsequent period up to 2020 forms a key part of this. However, much to our surprise, we found absolutely no mention of a substantive assessment in the 'non-paper' preparatory to the mid-term review. I should like to make clear, as the first speaker from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), that the new Commission must present the European Parliament with a substantive assessment rather than a caricature of regional policy.
As far as the PPE Group is concerned, we wish to focus the cohesion policy rather more on the key elements of this EU 2020 strategy, whilst retaining solidarity among all the regions and also Objective 2, about which the Commissioner spoke so vaguely just now. The promotion of competition in the rich regions forms part of the comprehensive assessment. Splitting budgets, increasing the sectoral fragmentation of funds at European level within the framework of such a mid-term review, serves no purpose whatsoever and is the wrong approach to take. In the present times of crisis, we are seeing how important regional funds are to recovery. These are being disbursed faster and are being fully utilised: in 2009, virtually 100% has been mobilised for innovation and new objectives in my region, the South Netherlands region. In early 2010, I myself shall be issuing a report on the synergy between regional funds and research and development.
For us, there is no question that we also need to change. In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy. In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money. We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation. Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation.
Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner's response was slightly evasive. For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly. Life-long learning is an important concept. However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy. There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, not much has been said about the significance of the European cohesion policy in Europe. It lies at the centre of the European Union, as it is the policy which holds the EU together at its heart. It is a symbol of solidarity and of overcoming national egoism. It is an instrument for all the regions. This is why the European Parliament is so concerned that this solidarity mechanism may simply be abolished behind our backs. It does not say much for good governance when the Commission secretly issues strategic documents, instead of holding an open debate about how we can continue with the solidarity mechanism in the light of the major challenges which face us, such as climate change and demographic change, given the tight budgetary constraints.
We need reform, but it must result in genuine change. It must bring about sustainable development in the regions. It must provide the regions with support for their projects and not consist of top-down policy, in the way that this earmarking mechanism currently does. Instead, it must develop a bottom-up process in close partnership with all the players in the regions. We are familiar with this process. We already have the LEADER method for the development of rural areas. This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and getting everyone involved in order to ensure a very high level of local acceptance. However, we need a Commission which is brave enough to say yes to the solidarity mechanism and yes to the regions deciding on their own development, rather than this being the responsibility of national governments.
From the perspective of future developments, I personally consider it vital firstly to align the role of local authorities correctly in managing European funds and secondly, to target European funds at supporting the use of modern technologies. It is precisely these two areas that are combined in the so-called Smart Cities initiative, which offers an opportunity to revitalise municipal authorities and, at the same time, to offer the business sector the opportunity in a period of economic crisis to apply modern systems and intelligent technologies and to generate economic growth. This is unquestionably a reason for focusing strategic investments on this area not only at a local authority level but also at a Member State and even EU level. Intelligent transport systems that can liberate cities from transport chaos, supportive navigation mechanisms that can increase the attractiveness of tourism in cities, and teleassistance systems enabling senior citizens to remain longer in their own homes are all types of investment that should be given the green light.
Without European regional policy, the communities in the regions would no longer be visible. For this reason, we are very annoyed by the signals coming from the Commission which include proposals for social programmes without the support of structural funding. This would turn the Commission into a social monopoly without the regions or would lead to calls for subsidy policy only for the weakest in our society. This, in turn, would mean that we would completely lose sight of the European context and we would return to the age of renationalisation.
I call on the Commission to focus much more closely on small and medium-sized enterprises and to involve the local authority areas, the towns and the municipalities much more in the future cohesion policy. We will definitely need to invest in the infrastructure in future, but most importantly, we must ensure that innovation and technology transfer are guaranteed for small and medium-sized enterprises. In future, we should also enable jobs to be subsidised. These are the crucial issues in choosing a new direction for the structural and cohesion policy in the European Union.
(DE) Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union. The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission's current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased.
The new draft represents a huge restriction on the principles of subsidiarity and multi-level governance, which is in contradiction to the Lisbon strategy. In specific terms, the draft includes plans to abolish Objective 2, in other words, competitiveness and employment policy. As there are Objective 2 regions in every Member State, this would, of course, sadly affect two thirds of all the EU regions. This unfortunate proposal is justified on the basis that the difference between new - or in other words, future - Member States and Western Europe at a national level is so great that a new budget policy is needed. In the light of the financial crisis, this is said to be a way of stimulating the economy.
I welcome the creation, by Parliament's Committee on Regional Development, of a working group on the future of cohesion policy. Consultation on the post-2013 budget and the future objectives of this policy must involve all the actors concerned: the Member States, the regions, the European Commission and Parliament. It is inconceivable to weaken, or indeed abolish, the regional and local levels that give full meaning to this policy. Where financing in particular is concerned, we are today faced with great uncertainty regarding the future of this cohesion policy. The expiry date of the current financial framework is uncertain, as is the extent of the reform of the financial perspective. The importance of maintaining stability in the financing of this policy must be remembered. It is also crucial to reject any idea of renationalising cohesion policy, since this would deprive the regions of the choice of how to share out the Structural Funds and would destroy the regional dimension of this policy.
We expect an unmistakably proactive attitude from the Commission concerning the preparation of a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, Commissioner. With regard to the distribution of these funds, we do not want egalitarianism but financial equity, and we want this in conjunction with a form of harmonious development that is based on findings and on situations that vary according to territory. Cohesion policy must not just focus on the most impoverished regions; it must be aimed at all of Europe's regions, including those overseas.
There are various signs, however, that moves are afoot to subvert the cohesion concept even further, either by trying to make it include and finance all kinds of actions and actors that have no connection with cohesion objectives - especially the European Union's strategy for 2020 and climate change policy - or by changing eligibility and management criteria. This debate on the cohesion policy after 2013 is therefore much needed. We look forward to obtaining clear responses in support of a genuine economic and social cohesion policy.
I should like to share with you a few ideas that I think should always be present when we think about and develop our cohesion policy. On a number of occasions, the Commission has mentioned certain aspects that I believe are essential, such as the need for this policy to be more flexible, simpler, more efficient and more results-oriented in its definition and implementation. There are, however, issues that cause me some concern, particularly with regard to the needs of the outermost regions. I should like to make three brief remarks in this respect.
When evaluating the policy and its effectiveness to date, it is worth answering a basic question: what will happen after 2013? The European Parliament should say clearly that there is no consensus on rationalisation of the cohesion policy. After 2013, as well as its traditional activities and mechanisms, the cohesion policy should support research, science, development, innovativeness, job creation and the fight with global warming. The cohesion policy should also include rural areas to a greater degree. It is important that realisation of the cohesion policy be based on regions and macroregions.
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly about three matters: equality of rights and status, secrecy and, last but not least, the importance of rural development. Twenty years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and 20 years after our fellow Member, László Tőkés, broke through the wall of silence at the start of the Romanian revolution in Temesvár (Timişoara) in Transylvania, it has been said more than once that in the 21st century, we no longer have old and new Member States in the European Union, but a single European Union. I fully agree with this statement, which is, of course, very general, but I feel it is important that it does not only appear as part of token decisions, but also features in the everyday application of the cohesion policy, one of the European Union's most important common policies.
If the European Union's Member States enjoy equal rights and status, it is inconceivable that the cohesion policy should be reformed in such a way that the European Union Member States who joined in 2004 and 2007 lose out in the new cohesion policy. Such a reform is simply unimaginable. My second point is about secrecy. It is a ridiculous state of affairs where the European Commission either pronounces some meaningless statements on the cohesion policy's future or says absolutely nothing at all on the subject. As an MEP and a member of the relevant European Parliament committee, I would expect the European Commission to adopt a clear, unambiguous position on these matters.
(PL) Mr President, Podkarpacie - the region I represent - is a region of wonderful, ambitious, hard-working people, a place where many energetic businesses operate. New initiatives are appearing, such as Aviation Valley, but at the same time, Podkarpacie is one of the most poorly developed areas in the European Union. Our problems are not the result of a lack of willingness, but of structural and infrastructural limitations, which, with the help of a variety of programmes, we are trying to eliminate. I would like to stress that, as part of our efforts, we are not asking for charity, but for support for our initiatives. We, too, want the competitiveness of the European economy to rise, and we want solutions which will help protect our climate.
We say 'no' to discrimination, 'no' to renationalisation, 'no' to bureaucracy, 'no' to a lack of transparency, 'no' to the secret disposal of funds and the abolition of Objective 2, which will harm Southern Europe and the Mediterranean. We say 'yes' to the fair distribution of Community funds, to the participation of local authorities, to the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises, to proper reform, which must be carried out so that there is proper funding of actions in keeping with the objectives of Europe for 2010. Finally, we say 'yes' to special treatment for remote areas, especially in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean.
Cohesion policy must be the same for both urban and rural areas. Let us remember that the Union, after such a major enlargement, is greatly differentiated. Ensuring equal opportunities for development is an important task. Contemporary challenges, which we have to face up to at the same time, are the fight against the economic crisis, the unfavourable demographic trend and, finally, climate change. One thing is certain: there is a need to continue the cohesion policy and to adapt it to the present challenges.
(RO) I would like to add to what my fellow Member said by saying that when we talk about intelligent cities, it is important for us to invest more in energy efficiency in residential buildings. 90% of the buildings which will exist in 2020 already exist now. This is why I am asking for the future cohesion policy to increase the European Regional Development Fund allocation so that it can be used by Member States to improve energy efficiency in buildings, especially homes. I also think that we need to invest more in public transport to develop urban mobility.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is of paramount importance. Given that we are dealing with a horizontal policy which redistributes more than a third of the EU's budget, the results from achieving the cohesion objectives have a crucial bearing on the continent's future. Since its inception, the cohesion policy has achieved spectacular successes in the EU15. Unfortunately, more active intervention is required in the Member States which have recently joined and are affected by extreme poverty. In addition, the situation is made even more difficult by new, strong challenges, such as climate change, the declining population or the global economic recession. Consequently, we must deal in the future with the territorial differences in social and economic indicators within a more effective and flexible framework. Strong emphasis must also be focused on the development of the least developed areas, especially small regions falling behind the regional average and struggling with far more severe disadvantages than even other areas surrounding them. With this purpose in mind, it would be worth considering earmarking resources at EU level, aimed specifically at bringing LAU 1 (formerly NUTS 4) planning-statistical regions into line where the decision about the use of these resources can be made by the relevant small regions or their associations. Coordination with the EU's other policies must also be improved. The barriers between the various funds must be eliminated so that the maximum possible allocation of resources can be achieved. The implementation rules must also be greatly simplified. Furthermore, priority must be given to investments relating to education, vocational training and sustainable employment, and to the implementation of comprehensive programmes tailored to the small regions' individual needs.
The Europe of the regions is a principle on which the EU has long agreed. The cohesion policy after 2013 must continue to make this vision a reality. One good approach is to make territorial cohesion the main objective. In this context, interregional cooperation plays an important role. In recent decades, the interregional approach has had some significant successes. The various EU projects in this area allow citizens to experience Europe directly and bring the freedom of action characteristic of European policy down to a regional level. However, there is still work to be done in the future. An interregional approach requires effective coordination to bring the different structures in the different countries into line. Other important cornerstones of regional policy in the years to come will be additionality in funding, cross-sectoral cooperation and conditionality. In order to ensure that the funding reaches the areas where it is needed, projects must have clear and specific objectives. In my opinion, careful long-term planning also brings added value and prevents funds from being wasted.
I fear the provisions put forward by the Commission - especially those concerning the ending of Objective 2 and abandonment of the regional aspect of cohesion policy in favour of a sectoral approach - may mean a return to the concept of a two-speed Europe and an increase in the distance, in terms of economy and civilisation, between the old and the new Europe. Such a model would be a departure from integration of the entire 27 and from the idea of solidarity enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon. That idea, surely, lies at the root of the entire cohesion policy, which is intended to bring about equalisation of opportunities and elimination of differences between regions.
The proposal of the Commission concerning increasing the emphasis on research and the development of new technologies should be praised. This is the route which Europe needs. In choosing this, we must not, however, forget those regions and countries where bringing the standard of living up to the EU average is a fundamental matter. Please remember that between the richest and poorest areas of the EU there is a greater than 11 times difference in wealth. Eliminating these differences must continue to be the main principle of EU cohesion policy.
We have an urgent matter on the agenda this afternoon. I would ask my fellow Members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process. Some Members who have been closely involved with this case know - and I cannot give any more details at this point, but I am one of those who knows - that we will have a solution for this case during the course of the day. Prominent government representatives from the EU are working to achieve a positive solution. Therefore, it would be sensible to remove this urgent matter from the agenda this afternoon, because any further debate would only hinder the work which is being done through diplomatic channels. This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case, we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda, because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be. That was my first request, Mr President. The second request will follow immediately.
(ES) In my capacity as leader of the Spanish Socialist delegation to the European Parliament, I should like to express my appreciation of the words spoken by the President of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supported by the President of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats). I do so for two reasons. Firstly, because as I see it, this House is clearly demonstrating its solidarity with Mrs Haidar personally and with her cause in this dangerous situation resulting from a prolonged hunger strike.
(ES) Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my surprise, given that, as Mrs Bilbao Barandica pointed out, we devoted almost three hours to debating this matter yesterday. If Mr Schulz has been in possession of relevant information concerning this matter since Sunday, we should have been informed accordingly yesterday. I repeat, the information should have been passed to us yesterday, before the joint resolution was debated. We should have been aware of this information when talks were held between the different groups, leading to an agreement, that is to say, to a compromise.
(DE) Mr President, I very much regret having to ask once again for the patience of the House. On the voting list today, we have the vote on the principle of subsidiarity. Under the terms of Rule 177(4) of the Rules of Procedure, I request that we postpone a vote on this point until the next plenary session and investigate the legitimacy of passing a resolution on this point. I believe that there is substantial agreement throughout this House that the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights should be guaranteed. However, there is absolutely no point in raising this to the level of the European Union. I would also like to say specifically on behalf of my Italian fellow Members that the debate taking place in Italy is an Italian and not a European debate and that, like us, my fellow Members will defend diversity and plurality. However, it does not make sense to do this in a resolution of this kind.
(PT) Mr President, I have a point of order. This morning we held a vote here to justify negotiations that existed between the European Union and Morocco. Since a Commission document has just come out, dated today, saying that EU - Morocco negotiations on the agri-food and fisheries sectors are progressing, I should like to know if it was these negotiations that the Chairman of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was referring to this morning when he used the negotiations as an argument to delete from today's agenda the topic on Aminatou Haidar, the Sahrawi fighter who has been on hunger strike for 32 days and is in a life-threatening condition at this very moment. This, then, is a point that needs to be duly clarified, because what happened here this morning is unacceptable.
I would like to enquire whether this process was followed because the situation we find ourselves in is quite extraordinary: This is the first time that the European Parliament has been prevented from debating a resolution agreed by all the parliamentary groups in response to an extremely serious situation, such as the case of Mrs Haidar. I would therefore like to know if this process was followed. If it was not, the resolution should be debated immediately. The resolution agreed by all the parliamentary groups must be recovered and put to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order, regarding my request on behalf of my group, the ECR Group, to postpone the vote that Mr Schulz called for to 15.00 to give us enough time to understand what this was all about. That was not actually put to the House. The President just put to the House the Schulz motion, and did not put my request for a motion to postpone it to give us two or three hours to cool down and find out the facts. I object to the fact that was not actually put to the House.
This bill's provisions are draconian and among them, let me inform the House, are: any person alleged to be homosexual would be at risk of life imprisonment or in some circumstances the death penalty; any parent who does not denounce their lesbian daughter or gay son to the authorities would face fines and probably three years in prison; any teacher who does not report a lesbian or gay pupil to the authorities within 24 hours would face the same penalties; any landlord or landlady who happens to give housing to a 'suspected' homosexual would risk seven years of imprisonment.
It is vital that this afternoon in this House we put aside our prejudices and we defend those who have no one left to defend them. Therefore, I warmly welcome the statement by the Commissioner on Development and Humanitarian Aid, Commissioner De Gucht, statements from the British, French and Swedish Governments as well as President Obama and the Chair and Vice-Chair of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs. I urge the House to give this the high importance which it deserves and to speak out for those in Uganda who currently are not being heard.
Mr President, some of the previous speakers have given details of this legislation which is now before the Ugandan Parliament. I would like to tell you a brief story. Around four to five years ago, I was in Kampala and one evening I met a group of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in a pizza restaurant, where the owner allowed the meeting to take place. On the same evening, a government minister said that raids would, in future, take place on any places where lesbians, gay men and transgender people met. I was rather worried that evening, as were the Ugandan lesbians and gay men. Luckily nothing happened, but it marked the beginning of increasing homophobia in Uganda. Now proposed legislation has been introduced which will not only make homosexuality a crime, as is already the case, but will also make it subject to the death penalty.
So many African Heads of State, including Museveni, have done a lot for their countries, but to say on this basis that homosexuality is un-African is simply wrong. Homosexuality has existed in all cultures on all continents throughout all periods of history and it will continue to exist, regardless of what legislation is passed. I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a joint resolution supported by almost all the groups, because it is important to express our opposition to the legislation and to support lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda. We must not allow them to be subjected to hate laws and stand by and say nothing.
We in the European Union have an obligation to uphold human rights all over the world and to remind the members of the Ugandan Parliament that the Cotonou Agreement, for example, states that human dignity and human rights apply to everyone and must be defended by everyone. I also hope that the resolution that we have presented will be adopted in its entirety, because it is important for organisations which defend the rights of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda to be supported, including by the European Union.
This proposed law includes provisions to punish those alleged to be lesbian, gay or bisexual with life imprisonment and even the death penalty. The draft also includes a provision that could lead to the imprisonment for up to three years of anyone, including heterosexual people, who fail to report within 24 hours the identities of everyone they know who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or who supports human rights for people who are. That means that any of us would also be susceptible to be taken to court for these reasons as well.
The Presidency and the Heads of Mission in Uganda also raised this issue with the Ugandan Government on several occasions, during meetings with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice, in Article 8 meetings, and with the Uganda Human Rights Commission. In its latest démarche on 3 December, the EU Presidency and the local troika met the acting Foreign Minister, to whom they again expressed these serious concerns, confirmed their support for fundamental freedoms and reminded Uganda of its international obligations. The Minister, while mentioning traditional values and cultural traditions that take time to change and alleging evidence of orchestrated campaigns to take advantage of poor people and recruit them into homosexuality, took note of the EU positions and committed himself to reporting them personally to the Cabinet and to Parliament in order to enable them to take an informed decision.
This operation is improving the relationship between the European Union and these countries and may lead to democratic and economic development of the area, albeit to a varying extent depending on the history of each country. Given this intelligent political strategy, in my view, it is inappropriate to hold this urgent debate on two young bloggers sentenced following events for which proceedings are still ongoing while we overlook other situations that are truly tragic, such as the recent massacre of 57 people who had come together to support a presidential election candidate in the Philippines.
In the ranking produced by Freedom House, Azerbaijan has the status of 'Not Free'. Reporters Without Borders say Azerbaijan is in 146th place out of 175 countries surveyed in terms of freedom of speech. Disturbing signals are also coming from analyses conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has evaluated Azerbaijan on the question of political freedoms. In this context, last year's refusal by the authorities in Azerbaijan to grant concessions to foreign media, such as the BBC and Radio Free Europe, should not surprise anyone.
Today we highlight the case of Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, which represents a crackdown on free media, free expression and civil society that is much deeper and wider than the case of merely two bloggers, as they have been called. They did indeed use new media like Facebook and Twitter for their youth organisation's work, but the fact is that we do not even know why they are imprisoned as evidence to defend their case has not been admitted in the trial, and the trial did not meet international standards - and, indeed, looks fabricated.
Yesterday, we awarded the Sakharov Prize in this House of the European people, and we saw a very impressive speech by the laureate, Mr Kovalev, who said that fear can only be met by freedom of thought, and freedom of thought can only be expressed when freedom of expression is actually guaranteed and when we listen to those people who are simply addressing issues such as opposition to their government, which we, as Europeans, have to guarantee in partnership with Azerbaijan in all areas.
author. - Mr President, I welcome the attention drawn to the appalling and consistent crushing of human rights in Azerbaijan: no freedom for the media, dozens of journalists jailed, some beaten, some even killed in recent years. But we must ask why the regime of Mr Aliyev is implementing such horrific repression. The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country. The ruling elite has enriched itself fabulously, especially in the oil and gas industry, while 90% of the population of Azerbaijan live in acute poverty and have seen no benefit from the natural resources of their country.
The second problem is a recent decision by Azerbaijani authorities to cancel the FM radio licences of several international radio stations like Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, BBC World Service and others, depriving listeners in this country of valuable and independent sources of information. Here I ask colleagues to agree to an oral amendment to paragraph 7 of the resolution: namely, not only to voice regret at the situation, but also to urge the Azerbaijani Government to cancel its decision and renew FM licences for the radio stations mentioned.
Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy. Azerbaijan ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and has undertaken to observe the provisions of Article 10 of this convention, which is devoted to freedom of expression and information. This Article establishes every person's right to freely express their opinion, receive and share information, without let or hindrance from governing institutions. Azerbaijan also has made a commitment not to flout human rights and not to impinge on individual freedoms and to safeguard the principles of democracy in its country by participating in the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership initiative. However, recently in Azerbaijan, the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association has increasingly come under threat and media activities are restricted. There is growing violence against journalists and civil society activists. I would like to urge Azerbaijan to take into account the European Parliament's proposals and encouragement to improve the human rights protection system and to ensure respect for media freedoms.
We are interested in Azerbaijan and have a great deal of goodwill for the country. It is trying to find its way step-by-step, and, indeed, is moving ever nearer to the western world, and not to the east. We should appreciate this. I think that we look upon Azerbaijan with a great deal of goodwill, and also on the authorities there. However, that goodwill must not order us not to speak out about things we do not like. Certainly, a situation in which two bloggers are locked up because they say what they think about the authorities is something which should not take place.
From this perspective, I understand the challenge of the European Parliament to the Azerbaijan office expressing disquiet over the results of a police investigation mounted against young people who make satirical references to visible shortcomings in the political life of the country. I agree that we cannot ignore the clearly unfavourable signals coming from Azerbaijan and I do not doubt the criticism of the political environment in Azerbaijan, but I also feel that there has been no emphatic criticism from the European Parliament concerning the current events in the Philippines, where 57 political hostages have been murdered. In my opinion, we should address all issues that shake the democratic world.
(DE) Mr President, following the first European elections in 1979, I had the honour of working with Otto von Habsburg, who is now seriously ill, to establish the human rights tradition of the European Parliament, including these topical and urgent debates on a Thursday afternoon. I was elected to the European Parliament in 1994 and I had the honour of working with Mr Schulz and others to further develop this human rights tradition, which we are rightly proud of. For this reason I was shocked when Mr Provera said with reference to Mr Schulz, who did not deserve this, that the case should not be taken up and almost repeated the threats made by the regime in Azerbaijan to civil rights activists in the country by saying that they will have to put up with it.
The human rights prize has already been mentioned today. I remember well that when we expressed our support for Andrei Sakharov, Vytautas Landsbergis and other campaigners for civil rights, people said at the time: Please do not get involved. We will make use of the diplomatic channels and you are causing more harm than good. Now we know that it was decisive for these people that Parliament spoke out clearly on their behalf. Therefore, Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, let us continue our tradition of independence on a Thursday afternoon. I would like to ask the group chairs to give us some freedom to act.
This has nothing to do with party politics. During the last session, one Member said that as we were just about to hold meetings with China, we could not talk about China. Today it was a different subject, the Western Sahara. Perhaps this is justified in individual cases, but I am seriously concerned about our human rights work. Ladies and gentlemen, the case of Azerbaijan demonstrates how important it is to be discerning here. The country was a Soviet satellite state. Monocultures were established, the country was destroyed and subjected to a brutal regime. Now it is slowly beginning to become more democratic. As a member of the Council of Europe, it has committed to human rights and we must help it to continue along this route.
(RO) I, too, support what Mr Posselt said earlier. At the same time, I would ask for the Azerbaijani Government to respect the right of freedom of expression of every citizen and to immediately drop the charges against the two young men, accused on the basis of fabricated evidence, as Mrs Lunacek mentioned earlier. I believe that this action must be taken urgently because the situation with regard to press freedom in this country has deteriorated sharply, as is also indicated by the latest reports from the Council of Europe and OSCE.
For over five years, I have been a member of the EU-Southern Caucasus Parliamentary Cooperation Committees. I visited Azerbaijan during every joint parliamentary session. In one of the documents, there is a point about the violation of the principles of freedom of speech, and about how journalists and publishers end up in prison, often on fabricated charges, and that they are not given medical help when they are ill. We have a case of a journalist who died because he did not receive medical assistance.
It is with great sadness that I have to inform you that Mrs Boal, deputy head of the European Union Delegation to Haiti, is, unfortunately, still missing. The search for Mrs Boal continues. She used to work in the European Parliament. Today, the Haitian nation, hit by the great tragedy of the earthquake, is in the thoughts of every one of us. Individual countries of Europe, as well as the whole European Union, have pledged substantial financial assistance for Haiti, along with deployment of 150 police officers as part of the European Gendarmerie. Teams sent by individual EU countries are also working there. This is the worst cataclysm in the history of Haiti, and one of the worst in the history of humanity. In addition, many of our fellow citizens, citizens of Europe, have died there, and many are believed to be missing. I would like you to commemorate the victims of this unimaginable catastrophe with a minute's silence. Please stand.
On 1 January, Spain assumed the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. I am sure that, under the new treaty and in cooperation with the new President of the Council, the Spanish Presidency will be a success and will achieve the objectives which have been set. In the programme of our session, we have a meeting with Prime Minister Zapatero, and we are going to talk about the Trio Programme. Therefore, we will not only be talking about Spain, but also about Belgium and Hungary.
Mr President, we have had some very heated debates. We have seen that there are actually very differing opinions on these findings of a court of justice that is not an EU court. We should not now lapse once again into a debate on this very serious topic, a debate that divides us more than it unites us. We should let the subject rest. We had differing opinions, we still have differing opinions, and that is why we should not come back to it to try and arrive at a new resolution.
The EU has responded quickly, not seeking headlines but with a total focus on getting help to the people in need. On advice from the United Nations, we resisted the urge to travel to Haiti immediately. That would only have diverted attention and scarce resources away from the relief effort. We will, of course, travel to Haiti as soon as it is appropriate, and I have agreed with Commissioner De Gucht that he will travel to Haiti this week to extend the EU's condolences and underline our commitment to the people. He will also take the opportunity to review our aid efforts so far and discuss with the United Nations and our people on the ground the most pressing needs for the weeks and months to come.
In the meantime, we continue to work flat out on all tracks: humanitarian, political and security. Over the past days, I have been in constant contact with Secretary of State Clinton, with the United Nations leadership, with EU Foreign Ministers and with Canada, which is leading the 'Friends of Haiti' group: all this with a view to ensuring an effective and coordinated international response. I will travel to the United States this week to follow up on this and other issues with the United States Administration, and with the UN Secretary-General and others in New York.
In total, this is a big response in a short time. Assistance will be targeted, too, to the Dominican Republic. Finding enough money is going to be less of a problem at the moment than getting it out to the people who need it. We must ensure that it is properly targeted towards sustainable political and physical reconstruction. Following the UN Secretary-General's request for help with transport of humanitarian aid and for additional police units, the Council invited me to identify EU Member State contributions and make proposals for this mobilisation. I am working on this.
Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. It is a country in a chronically fragile situation whose existing basic functions and capacities have been very seriously disrupted. Also, the international community has been hard hit. Staff of the United Nations and NGOs and our own Commission staff are still missing, and this also explains the difficulties of organising aid on the spot. People have to understand that it is not out of a lack of competence, but because the aid community has itself been hit. Relief operations are not flowing as speedily as one would wish, although one sees that this is getting better by the hour.
The Council welcomes the fact that we will urgently send a team of EU experts with the specific task of assessing the most critical needs of the Haitian state and civil administration in order to provide technical assistance. Our diplomatic and cooperation staff on the ground are, of course, best placed to do that, but their capacity is overstretched. This is something that will become more and more important in the coming days. As the European Union and the European Commission, together with the Council, we could play a leadership role in re-establishing state institutions physically, and also in terms of people.
Lastly, the financial response. As the High Representative has already outlined, the European Commission will make a major contribution, first of all in terms of humanitarian aid - EUR 30 million, of which the largest part - EUR 22 million to be exact - is completely fresh money that comes on top of the already existing humanitarian engagements we have with Haiti. The early recovery assistance - which is not humanitarian assistance, and what I just said about the state institutions of course comes under this umbrella - amounting to EUR 100 million, with a 50-50 balance between money redirected and fresh money, and then the longer-term reconstruction assistance, where there is now an initial amount of EUR 200 million.
Then we will have to see where we stand. Now one is hearing figures in the region of USD 10 billion. That seems a lot to me and, in any case, cannot be matched by the Commission budget. We will have to see with the Pledging conference and with the Member States how exactly we are going to eventually participate in higher sums. That is the EU-wide package that has now been prepared on top of all the contributions that are already being made and will be made by the Member States.
As the High Representative said, I will be going to the region - Haiti and also the Dominican Republic - tomorrow morning to have discussions with the authorities, including on the efforts to try to rebuild the state institutions. The President and major NGOs are on the spot. I will also go to the Dominican Republic. It is important that we also see those authorities, because they are the neighbours. You can already see that the situation might eventually create some overstretching at the border, so I will also see the Dominican authorities.
The European Union is the biggest aid donor in the world, donating 60% of aid, and we are probably the biggest donor of humanitarian aid as well. But, while one sees the US hospital ships there, all we see from the EU is Member States going in from Belgium and Ireland and Britain or wherever. There should be some visible EU presence. Why not battle groups? Why not some standing groups, on a rotating basis, who would be ready to go into the area when these sort of things occur?
Looking to the longer term, I am pleased that there will be an international conference on Haiti. I think we need to look at the whole issue of Haiti, about its outstanding debt, and I hope the debt problems of Haiti will be on the agenda at the international conference. Haiti owes USD 890 million to the international creditors and a large part of that is to the IMF. The IMF has given Haiti a USD 100 million loan. Can we convert that into a grant? There is no point impoverishing this country for another 100 years. So I hope you will put that on the agenda of the IMF meeting.
We must therefore firstly provide Haiti with as much support as possible in order to deal with emergencies. From this point of view, we cannot but lament the fact that international aid has been very difficult to put into place. In future, we must improve our procedures. However, we must, above all, be aware that long-term development aid will not be effective if we impose what we consider to be the right priorities while everyone on the ground is telling us that we are wrong. We must proceed by calling our own methods into question, and that will not work unless we increase the funds that we are putting aside for development policies in the long term. The European Union has announced the amount of aid that it will release for Haiti, and the Member States have done the same. We are talking about EUR 130 million in the short term, and EUR 200 million for long-term needs.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, our hearts and minds go out to the people of Haiti in their hour of suffering. I commend Baroness Ashton and Karel De Gucht for what they have already said has happened and is being done. There is no question that there will be funds coming. I was present at the tsunami which hit Sri Lanka and then later Indonesia. I have witnessed earthquakes in Turkey. I watched what happened in China. Every time one of these things happens, we are caught short, not with water purification tablets or tents or clean water but with infrastructure. We say, oh, the infrastructure is destroyed. Of course it is destroyed. We need to be able to supply very rapidly an emergency infrastructure.
I am nevertheless pleased with the rapid reaction of the European Commission and the Member States and with the commitment they have made to earmark a massive aid package of EUR 429 million for the emergency humanitarian aid effort and the reconstruction of Haiti. However, it is regrettable that the Europeans have acted in an uncoordinated manner and that the actions of the European Union are not visible enough, something that contrasts sharply with the efficiency of the US aid machine and makes us forget that the European Union is the world's biggest donor of humanitarian aid and development aid.
The European Commission has also activated the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, which coordinates offers of assistance from the Member States and currently represents the crux of our crisis response system. Recent events confirm the need to improve the European Union's response to crises. A real organisation with civil protection capacities is essential, and for this reason, I would remind you of Mr Barnier's proposal, which dates from 2006 and proposes the creation of a European civil protection force; it is ready and just has to be applied.
(CS) All of us will certainly agree that this is one of the greatest disasters in that region in the last 200 years. And speaking on behalf of my colleagues in the European Conservatives faction, and on behalf of my fellow citizens in the Czech Republic, I would like to express sympathy and compassion for all the victims and those who are suffering. Nevertheless, regardless of this tragedy, there are signs that even after the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union is still uncoordinated and incapable of prompt action. It distantly reminds me of a four-headed dragon. We have a President, Prime Minister of the presiding country, President of the Commission, and Commissioner-designate. Ladies and gentlemen, I personally believe that in this particular case, we have to recognise that the European Union has been caught flat-footed. Those who have not been caught napping are the citizens in the individual Member States who have been providing material as well as financial aid day after day.
I believe that a European Union rapid intervention operational force must be created because the situation in Haiti demonstrates to us the need to maintain public order and ensure the population's safety, in addition to the assistance required by the survivors. We are certainly in a situation at the moment where many voices are protesting and making accusations that the alleged intention is to carry out a military occupation under the guise of humanitarian assistance. However, in a situation where UN forces are insufficient or have been overtaken by events, the European Union should take further involvement, especially as it enjoys a large amount of credibility in the region.
In addition, we should think about what could be done better. In fact, I have just one question for Mrs Ashton: this is the first such situation you have been faced with in your new position. What is your main conclusion from this event, and from the mistakes which we are all talking about here? More importantly, what can be changed in future? I think this is the most important thing we should think about, and it is, to a great extent, our role to do so.
When is this going to end? When is the Commission finally going to act? Do not come and tell us that this is complicated, because the projects are ready. We just need to use them. In 2006, Mr Barnier proposed the creation of a European civil protection force, with Member States contributing on a voluntary basis, without having to wait for hypothetical unanimity from the 27, by pooling existing national civil protection units, by training them together with joint rescue techniques, joint communication methods and a joint headquarters.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to add my voice to that of Mr Juvin - the humanitarian aid is poorly coordinated. I do not want to talk only about humanitarian aid, but about what is called technical, structural or development aid. The catastrophe was not foreseeable, but we did know what a terrible state Haiti is in, and to make matters worse, it has been struck by this misfortune. We have known for a long time what a bad condition Haiti is in, and how badly its structures function. We know, too, that if they had been functioning better, and if, before the earthquake, we had organised aid and technical cooperation with Haiti in a better way, those structures would have been working better and, as a result, it would have enabled better use of our aid now and would have saved many thousands of people - but that did not happen.
Does Mrs Ashton, as High Representative and a Member of the Council, intend to take specific action, with specific dates, to coordinate the technical cooperation of various European countries so that the third countries to which we give aid really use that aid well? Are we going to use any kind of exchange of best practices between countries which have a lot of experience, where technical cooperation functions very well, and countries which are only beginning to use that technical cooperation? Will a good, common, strong European policy come into being, which third countries will really make use of, so that we will not give humanitarian aid in the dark and in haste when, unexpectedly, hundreds of thousands of people find themselves in a tragic situation?
Lady Ashton, Europe can take them in and offer them adequate living conditions; I mean for a limited period, until the conditions are adequate for them to return to their own country. All this could be organised, all this could be easy for the European countries, and it would be a fair way to respond to the need for solidarity, but also to avoid speculative and illegal actions being taken at the expense of children. We are talking about children, the most precious resource that we should protect in Haiti.
When, a while ago, the crisis management forces were established to bolster the European's foreign and security policy, including its defence policy, the reason I was given for this, at least in Finland, was that these forces were also there in the event of natural disasters, and that they could help when such catastrophes struck anywhere in the world, including Europe of course. Now, however, crisis management forces actually have nothing to do in the different parts of Europe in which they are stationed. They have nothing to do. Fortunately, there are no crises in Europe, and so they have nothing to do. What is stopping these crisis management forces from being used for crises like this if help is being requested?
(LT) Today, after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are probably dealing with the biggest tragedy that has ever taken place and we need to understand the position of the High Representative when, at the very beginning of their term, they have to solve a rather complicated task which, I would even say, they have never had to deal with before. Yes, it is true, today we see some shortcomings and in future, we need better prepared European Union joint forces, who could take part in rescue operations. I think that the greatest contribution today would be for that money that was mentioned today to be sent to the Republic of Haiti, to be put to use as soon as possible and spent on the rebuilding of infrastructure, as the President of Haiti mentioned, and it can perhaps be put towards removing some of those collapsed homes that are lying in the streets today.
I put the question very early to the United Nations on the ground, and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, where best my efforts could be. There was no doubt that I had nothing to contribute on the ground other than to take up valuable space when planes were circling the airfield unable to land because of the state of the airfield at the present time. I am not a doctor. I am not a fire-fighter. My place was to bring together the coordination, to be talking to the Friends of Haiti Group, to be coordinating with the United States to make sure that we put in the maximum effort on the ground.
For the long term, honourable Members are absolutely right. When the cameras have gone, we need to be there. We need to be there physically, we need to be there in terms of the support we can give. I agree that debt issues need to be a part of the discussions that take place. I agree that what is done must be done in partnership with the Haitian people with due respect for them. I agree on the importance of rebuilding the infrastructure, and I agree that we have to ensure that the role of the United Nations is recognised and make sure that they are able to fulfil it well.
Let me just tell you a little bit about the infrastructure at the moment. Hospitals, electricity, communications, water supply, seaports and airports have been badly damaged. The main official buildings, the Presidential Palace, the Parliament, Ministries of Treasury, Justice, Planning, Health and Interior are completely destroyed. Many of the high government officials are missing. The capacities of the Haitian Government are not functioning. It is, as you said, already one of the poorest countries in the world, and because we need to rebuild that infrastructure, I share your commitment to make sure that we do.
Thirdly, let us not forget that, in the second Barroso Commission, humanitarian relief and civil protection have been combined under one Commissioner, which is, I think, a very valuable effort. In addition we also now have a High Representative, who will have a double hat. What we have seen in the past about coordination is that it is not lacking inside the Commission for example - I will come back to that in a minute - but it is sometimes between the European institutions and the Member States and between the European Commission and Council. The whole idea behind this double-hatting was precisely that the Council and Commission could work better together, and I think it has been demonstrated in this crisis that this has, in fact, been quite an advance.
Lastly, I would also like to say that I am a little bit sad about what some speakers have said. Of course as a Commissioner, I cannot be sad, I just have to take notice of it, but it does not pay enough tribute to all our people who have been working, on the spot and in Brussels, from hour one, day and night, during the weekend, without any complaint, without asking for any compensation. They have been working very hard and within hours they were also active on the spot, although their facilities were also hit hard.
I would like to express my solidarity with the people of Haiti affected by the earthquake that hit the country on 12 January, and I welcome the aid commitments made by the EU. The European Union is the world's largest provider of humanitarian and development aid. A few hours after the catastrophe, the EU provided EUR 3 million of aid for the initial relief operations. A sum of EUR 134 million was released for early rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. EUR 200 million has been set aside for rehabilitation in the longer term, adding to the EUR 92 million that has been given by different EU countries. These amounts, totalling EUR 429 million, may be further increased, depending on the needs assessment. I would like to congratulate the European Commission on their coordination of the aid, but I am disappointed that the European Union has not been visible enough on the ground. This is detrimental to the image of the EU in international public opinion, and is in contrast with the image of the US, which contributed EUR 91.6 million. During this crisis, there has been a clear need for medical care, so I am calling for an increase in the quota of doctors and health technicians, along with greater logistical support.
I am surprised by the absence of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from the scene of the natural disaster in Haiti. In spite of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union still has difficulty in showing its face on the international stage, and that is most regrettable. It seems to me that the European crisis response system is too fragmented, too complex and not successful enough. In terms of the rehabilitation of Haiti (for which EUR 100 million are earmarked) and the reconstruction of the country (EUR 200 million), what exactly will the EDF and the Stability Instrument fund? Furthermore, to respond to the UN request in terms of logistical and security support, the European Union must, in my view, be in a position to use all the instruments provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, including military response. I call for the rapid establishment of a European civil protection force as devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 with the aim of arriving at a European response that is planned, genuinely coordinated and effective. The recent statements by Mr Van Rompuy are along the right lines. He advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force. What will be the exact nature of this project and when will it see the light of day?
Ladies and gentlemen, the reports reaching us from Haiti are shocking. It is one of the most horrifying catastrophes we have heard of. However, we can already draw certain conclusions which may be useful in future. It can be clearly seen that the mechanisms which coordinate humanitarian aid are not the best. Aid for the Haitians could have been more effective if the donors of humanitarian aid had been able to use better means of coordinating their work. Improving cooperation is not a matter just for the European Union, because progress in this area requires constructive analysis and action on the part of all substantial donors. In situations such as the one in Haiti today, what is important is speed, adequacy and elasticity. Today is not the right time to deliberate, for example, about who should control the airport in the capital of Haiti. That is, of course, important, but decisions on the use of specific solutions should be made at another time. Now, we must do everything possible to concentrate on the most important objective - saving human lives.
in writing. - The recent earthquake in Haiti demonstrates to us all how fragile living on this earth can be. We have all been moved by the pictures and stories coming from the media in recent days. The response of the global community to this natural disaster has been amazing and I commend all of those who are helping with the relief effort or funding the relief effort from home. It will take generations for the people of Haiti to fully recover from what will hopefully be a once in a lifetime event. It is important that this House shows solidarity to those people. It would be my hope that the European Union could play a leading role in giving those people hope of a better future. Emergency aid in the short term must be backed up with longer-term aid to help the future generations recover from this most horrific ordeal. The way Members of this House, across all political groups, have responded to date has been extremely heartening. I look forward to working with my colleagues to do what I can for the people of Haiti. The EU must aim to be an example of the well off always willing to give a hand-up to those less advantaged then ourselves.
Mr President, tragic information about the disastrous earthquake in Haiti reaches us every day. From this news, it is absolutely clear that Haiti, plunged into total chaos and left without support, is not coping with the effects of that terrible tragedy. The entire international community, including the European Union, is obliged to give humanitarian aid to the victims of this disaster, who are completely bereft of basic necessities. Therefore, I would like to appeal strongly for the appropriate European Union structures to take immediate and effective action in order to send, as quickly as possible, essential aid and support for the fight with the results of the earthquake in Haiti.
Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the High Representative for her words, which struck the necessary note of optimism. There are, indeed, positive signs. Amongst other things, you made reference to the lower number of deaths resulting from attacks, and the forthcoming elections. Yet, Baroness Ashton, even successful elections do not make a democracy, nor do they make a state under the rule of law. To quote a great German, Schiller, in your native English, Baroness, 'The voice of the majority is no proof of justice'. A mature democracy also recognises the rights of minorities. I do have serious concerns in that area. I find it disappointing that the word 'minorities' did not come up in what you had to say to the House.
Why am I worried? Human Rights Watch continues to report that non-Muslim minorities are being persecuted. Since 2004, there have been attacks on 65 churches. Local militias continue to drive Christians from their homes. The day before yesterday, a 52-year old greengrocer, a father of two daughters, was shot dead in the middle of the street in Mosul. This, of course, leads to the ongoing flight of Christian minorities from Iraq. In 1991, they still numbered 850 000; after the Gulf War they numbered 550 000, while after the US invasion this number was down to 385 000, 100 000 of whom are internally displaced people. The European Union cannot continue to stand idly by in this situation. Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union refers to human rights, including the rights of minorities, as literally one of the core values of the European Union. We require respect for minorities of our 27 Member States and it is your job, Baroness Ashton, to command that respect at the international level, too.
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that the Iraqi security forces are still not well-trained, and are still not functioning well. So we should not only support the rule of law but, if asked, we should also be prepared to help them by assisting their security forces. There needs to be an integrated approach concerning energy, the economy and stability. There needs to be an integrated approach concerning the states neighbouring Iraq. Please would you give a clue about that integrated approach? Thank you on behalf of the ALDE Group.
I do think it is relevant to mention that the debate we are having tonight is taking place against the backdrop of the Chilcot inquiry in the UK into the illegal war on Iraq and what lessons should be learned from that, and a lot of information is coming to light which confirms what many of us believed at the time of the invasion: that the reason for the war was regime change and control of resources and not the threat of weapons of mass destruction. And, in terms of long-term planning for a post-war Iraq, words like 'dire', 'deeply flawed' and 'woefully thin' are being used by senior diplomats and military officers in their evidence to the inquiry, so it is little wonder that we are now seeing severe consequences of the action.
Baroness Ashton said that some progress has been made, and of course it has, but there are severe problems still. There is no legislation to protect minorities in Iraq. There is a continuing major refugee problem. Trade unionists, journalists, women politicians and human rights activists have disappeared or have been killed. Suicide attacks continue. With elections due on 7 March, the Iraqi Election Commission last week, as my colleague mentioned, barred almost 500 candidates, mainly Sunni politicians, from standing. They are already under-represented in the Iraqi Parliament and this is certain to lead to more tension and instability.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the elections will not be free and fair in Iraq. Ten days ago, the Justice and Accountability Commission decided to ban Saleh al-Mutlaq, leader of the parliamentary National Dialogue Front and a member of the Iraqi Parliament for the past four years. He has been banned from participating in the forthcoming elections. I think it was no coincidence that this outrageous ban, together with the banning of over 500 further secular Iraqi politicians, was announced on the very day Manouchehr Mottaki, Iran's odious Foreign Minister, was visiting Baghdad. Saleh al-Mutlaq has been an outspoken critic of Iranian meddling in Iraq, and now the mullahs have insisted on his removal from the election.
As proof of this, the Commission has decided not to send observers because it cannot guarantee their safety. I believe this decision speaks for itself. It clearly shows that as far as Iraq is concerned - and I know that you do not want to talk about the past, but we have no option but to talk about the past - we are faced with a country that has been devastated, with more than 1 million people dead and 4 million homeless as a result of an illegal, unfair war based on lies. Neither were there any weapons of mass destruction nor any connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. That is the plain truth of it. The only thing that was true was the interest of the North American oil industry in gaining control of crude oil in Iraq.
Madam President, High Representative, on Christmas night, 2009 - while we were on our Christmas recess, in other words - a number of churches in Iraq, Mesopotamia, were closed. Threats of bombings led to this sad situation, just as they had last year. In any case, the churches often remain empty, with or without such threats, as more and more Christians are leaving the country. The violence against them just goes on increasing, despite their shrinking numbers. Before Christmas, there were three deadly attacks in Mosul. Moreover, the Christians in the previously relatively safe city of Kirkuk, too, have, for several months, faced a simply unrelenting series of kidnappings and killings, resulting in the flight of hundreds of Christian families.
While there were around 1.5 million Christians in Iraq in 2003, more than half of them have now sought safety from religious cleansing in flight, religious cleansing that is being performed by Islamic extremists. Is the European Council, are the 27 Member States of the European Union, just watching on meekly as this Afghanisation of Iraq takes place, an Iraqi Christian has asked. I would appreciate hearing your position on this, High Representative. Whatever it may be, a Mesopotamia without its ancient Christian community will not face a more tolerant future, nor will that be good for Europe's security in the long term.
The main problems facing the authorities in Baghdad are the postponement of the referendum on the SOFA agreement signed with the United States and of the finalisation of the oil and gas law, the drop in oil price, the large number of executions - there are currently 900 people who have received the death sentence - and the use of torture to obtain confessions. The general deterioration in the human rights situation is causing the EU deep disquiet. Last but not least, there is the rise in the level of corruption. One example I would like to give you of this is the arrest of the former Iraqi trade minister.
(PT) The democratic achievements of the Iraqi people still need to be consolidated and furthered, as does the security situation. In recent months, there has been an encouraging reconfiguration of alliances, which has done much to overcome the ethnic-religious splits that have marked Iraqi politics in recent years. The success of the new Kurdish 'Change' party is an example of the normalisation of political life in Iraq. However, the Election Commission's recent statement that around 500 Sunni politicians would be barred from standing is not conducive to national reconciliation, may jeopardise the electoral process and could reignite conflicts. The news about the application of the death penalty is also disheartening. Baroness Ashton, European leaders should strive to convince the Iraqi authorities to abolish it. The strengthening of the EULEX is also important in this regard.
One and a half million Iraqis still live in neighbouring countries. Many will never be able to return. The European countries that participated in the invasion in 2003 have a particular responsibility, and should welcome more of these refugees. In this respect, as in the cases of support for internally displaced persons, human rights issues in general and women's rights in particular, and the fight against corruption, it is vital that the Iraqi Government rectifies the NGO law, so that society can organise itself freely. It is imperative that the European Union encourages interaction between Iraqi and European NGOs. A society that is civil, free and dynamic is a prerequisite for the consolidation of democracy in Iraq.
(PL) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, despite the huge commitment of international forces and hundreds of victims among the international coalition, including 23 Polish soldiers, the situation in Iraq is still bad. It is a country in which we have to deal with terrorist attacks and persecution of religious minorities, including the Christian minority, and, of course, in comparison with what the situation was like several years ago, some progress has been made. However, we still receive news of terrorist attacks which are destabilising not only Iraq but the whole of the Middle East. The objective of the terrorists and the sponsors of international terrorism is the destabilisation of Iraq. Much evidence points to the fact that Iran is responsible for sponsoring terrorism.
What is your opinion, Mrs Ashton, as the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, concerning the role of Iran in interfering in the affairs of Iraq? I would like to encourage you to adopt a more assertive stance and to cooperate with the United States in order to achieve solutions which will influence and put pressure on Iran to stop interfering in Iraq's internal affairs. In my opinion, only then will the possibility exist of bringing about a relative degree of stability in the region.
Rebuilding Iraq in economic, trade, cultural and financial terms, and guaranteeing its security, are essential conditions for the development of democracy, but we must also promote the strengthening of the country's institutions. The peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic and religious groups present in Iraq can be brought about through a renewal of the institutions, with the implementation of a federal formula - federalism - which allows broad autonomy for the various regions within the framework of a unitary State. The experience of Iraqi Kurdistan could be a useful reference point.
I would like to remind you that 3 912 women stood quite openly in the local elections in Iraq last year. That is roughly ten women standing for each seat. That must be seen as a positive thing, particularly in an Arab country. It also provided us with some hope ahead of this year's parliamentary elections on 7 March, particularly since the Sunnis participated in the local elections. As has already been stated, however, two weeks ago, a government commission refused 14 Sunni parties and several hundreds of people permission to participate in the elections. Among those affected are defence minister Abdul-Qadir al-Obaidi and Saleh al-Mutlaq, the head of the Sunni-led Iraqi Front for National Dialogue.
The Iraqi parliamentary elections are, of course, crucial to the future of the country and for the future democratisation of Iraq, particularly as regards Iraq's ethnic and religious cohesion. I would also like to underline that we must speak plainly as regards the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq. As I mentioned, the Iraqi parliamentary elections will be decisive for how we regard Iraq in the immediate future. What does the EU's High Representative, Baroness Ashton, believe that the EU can do to make the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Iraq inclusive and more democratic?
(LT) In recent years, the European Union has greatly strengthened its relations and influence in the countries of the Near East. The European Union has always paid much attention to Iraq and, together with the international community, has participated both in the reconstruction of Iraq and in peacekeeping and security missions. Different groups are still struggling for power in the country, which hinders the implementation of reforms begun in the country in various areas. The fact that 14 parties are banned from participating in the elections that are taking place is also cause for concern. Iraq has chosen the road to democracy and therefore, both the European Union and other states must demand and, if necessary, help ensure that the international commitments entered into are observed and human rights and freedoms are respected. I believe that Iraq really is ready for close cooperation with the European Union. The Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and Iraq in the area of energy cooperation which was signed on Monday demonstrates its commitment to develop a long-term relationship that is mutually beneficial. From an energy point of view, Iraq is very important to the European Union, but safeguarding security of energy supply is inevitably linked to economic and political stability in the country, which has been lacking in recent times. Clearly, this is a long-term process, but I believe that the European Union, the High Representative and the international community must offer means and solutions to make the principles of human rights and the rule of law become the fundamental pillars of future politics in Iraq.
(PL) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, I would like to say that if I wanted to summarise Mrs Ashton's speech in one sentence, I would say it was official optimism. However, I think Europe and our voters expect something more specific, and they expect the truth. Politicians show who they are not only by what they say, but also by what they do not say, and I did not hear in your speech, Mrs Ashton, anything about some matters which have shocked a significant part of European public opinion, including public opinion in my country. I am thinking, for example, of the regular persecution of minorities in Iraq, including, and I stress this, of Christians. This is a reality of which we can be certain.
I think my colleague, Mr Poręba, was right in what he said a moment ago about Iranian interference in Iraq. Is the same not true of the Iraqi authorities and their scandalous intervention in Camp Ashraf, which houses Iranian refugees? Are the Iraqi authorities not doing just this? It seems to me this should be stressed very strongly, especially because the Iraqi authorities are receiving financial aid from the European Union, which they then often use in a highly improper way, for example, in the intervention in Camp Ashraf.
(PL) Madam President, I think Iraq can serve as an example of how sometimes, to break the back of a dictatorship which destroys its opponents in their thousands using chemical weapons, it is necessary to use force. These decisions are difficult. Therefore, I would like us, today, while speaking about Iraq, to remember the thousands of soldiers from the United States, Italy, Poland and other countries who have fallen in Iraq, and to remember their families. They went there believing they were going to serve in a good cause, and, as we are hearing here, Iraq is, today, on the way to building a democracy.
I share your opinion, Mrs Ashton, that, fortunately, the situation in Iraq is a little better than it was, but it is still in a rather fragile state. Alongside the diverse measures which the Union is taking, I would like to propose two specific measures, because it seems to me they are missing. The first matter concerns something which has not been mentioned today: I think it is exceedingly important for the development and stabilisation of Iraq to adopt a programme for the education of young Iraqis in Europe, because in Iraq, there is still a shortage of doctors, engineers and irrigation specialists. I think we could help Iraq greatly in this area. The second matter concerns protection of the cultural treasures which are to be found in Iraq. I think the EU should, in particular, help with the rebuilding of Babylon. This is a treasure which everyone in the world should take care to protect.
(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, my question relates to the memorandum of understanding that has been signed in the energy sector. Do you think it is possible to achieve further development together with either Mr Oettinger or Mr De Gucht? In my opinion, economic reconstruction would be the very thing to bring more stability to Iraq. If we were to improve relations in the energy sector, particularly through greater provision of European equipment to make better use of the energy reserves that are present there, with us buying energy there to compensate, we would have a win-win situation for both sides. An initiative in the next few weeks would make great sense in this regard.
The review of candidates was always part of the pre-electoral process. There is an appeals procedure, which I trust will be allowed to run its proper course. I should also say that we do plan to send our EU mission next week, which is six weeks ahead of election day, and that will enable us to follow first-hand and closely the pre-election process, which is of great interest. We trust and hope that the Iraqi authorities will ensure an inclusive electoral process, for all the reasons that honourable Members have made absolutely clear in what they have said.
A number of Members also raised the issue of the memorandum of understanding on energy and its importance and significance. We are very clear in doing this that Iraq is a unitary state and that all our cooperation is with the government of all of Iraq. We fully support Iraq remaining a unified and sovereign state. Within this area, it will be important to enhance cooperation - and I heard what was said, in particular, by Mr Rübig, who described the need to think further about enhancing that cooperation. I will feed that back to the Commissioners-designate.
I am also aware, when I say that there is an issue around the security question, that the issue of Kirkuk is a very important one, as well as other disputed boundaries. I described that as one of the major challenges which Iraq faces at the present time. I feel very strongly that Iraq has to solve these issues for itself. It is for Iraq to deal with. However, I am very keen to support the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, which has made significant efforts to try and begin a dialogue and a process. To be cautious, though, I do not expect dialogue to be of any significant level pre the elections, at this particular stage.
Just a little bit more about energy cooperation too. We see this as being part of developing a comprehensive and integrated energy policy for Iraq. This is about the supply and security of supply between Iraq and the European Union and should, of course, include the development of renewable energy, particularly solar and wind energy, and to also enhance energy efficiency measures within Iraq. I hope, too, that we will see technological, scientific and industrial cooperation as well over the coming months and years. That point was well made.
Going back to where we began, I am optimistic about Iraq. There are significant challenges, and honourable Members are right to remind us of those significant challenges. However, we can see, with the coming elections and with the opportunity for greater cooperation - an opportunity for the European Union, with its value system and the things we are particularly concerned about: human rights, the rights of minorities, the issues of capital punishment, developing strong cooperation on energy security and supply and working more closely with the government, while being clear about the expectations we have - a future for Iraq that will be peaceful and democratic. We must ensure that we work consistently towards that end.
I know of only a few countries relatively close to Europe which have managed to put their 'democratisation' process off for several decades. Iraq, where units from EU countries have also unfortunately left a negative mark, is definitely one of them. At present, one of the most secular states in the Islamic world has been left in ruins, with three of its communities constantly at loggerheads. What has survived from the past are just memories of the country's relatively good education and health care systems, and a comparatively advanced infrastructure. This is the only country in the region where the Kurdish minority was autonomous, even though no ideal democratic regime ruled in the country. By and large, the question is which country of the region can we describe as having a truly democratic regime? The fact that, following the invasion by the US Army, the Iraqi state has been totally disrupted marks, together with the partial liquidation of the infrastructure of its social, health care, and educational systems, a giant step backwards. The cloak of so-called democratic elections can by no means cover that up. The ongoing efforts aimed at distracting attention from current problems by stage-managed trials of prominent figures of Saddam Hussein's regime are naive. Only a person absolutely unacquainted with the situation could believe that it can be improved in this way. The only positive aspect of the recent period is that both the US administration and the Iraqi Government have realised that there will be no improvement without good relations with Iran.
I am pleased at the optimistic tone of Mrs Ashton's speech, but I would rather maintain a certain caution in my assessment of the situation in Iraq. Despite many appearances, the country is still internally unstable, and democracy most certainly cannot be said to have 'taken root'. We cannot speak of stabilisation in a country within whose borders 1.8-1.9 million residents have been displaced, while a further million have left the country altogether, and the conditions under which the refugees are living are extremely poor.
It has been a consistent complaint of the European Parliament for the last decade that procedural safeguards and defendants' rights have not received the same attention, let alone action, as moves to enhance the speed and efficiency of investigations and of prosecutions. We have supported the latter because, then, more criminals get caught. Those who reject in principle the European Arrest Warrant are the apologists for mafia criminals and absconding robbers, rapists and terrorists. But it is question of balance and getting 'European Arrest Warrant plus', and thus justice all round, through procedural guarantees to accompany simplified cross-border prosecutions. Opponents of the European Arrest Warrant of course do not want any EU action on rights either; they just want 'European Arrest Warrant minus'.
But the application of the European Arrest Warrant without proper procedural guarantees has, in some cases, led to the denial of justice, because mutual recognition has not been accompanied by a solid basis for mutual trust. One of those cases is my own constituent Andrew Symeou. Andrew has been in prison in Greece for six months awaiting trial on a manslaughter charge which seems to be based on mistaken identity and, I am afraid to say, police brutality to witnesses, and I believe the European Arrest Warrant has been misused. When it was agreed upon in 2002, it was with the understanding from all sides that this measure, which would have the effect of EU citizens standing trial and being held in prison in another Member State, would be swiftly followed by measures guaranteeing their fair trial rights and guaranteeing there would be no miscarriages of justice. That promise was betrayed by Member States in failing to accept the Commission's 2004 proposal for a reasonably wide framework decision on procedural rights, and now a piecemeal approach is the best we can get. I am grateful that it was relaunched by the Swedish Presidency, but it is only a roadmap on a step-by-step basis.
We need to see the glass is half full and be optimistic, although I regret that the Council is, worryingly, only promising to consider, not to legislate on, Euro-bail, which would have helped Andrew Symeou, who has been explicitly refused bail because he is a foreigner. Judges are currently asked to enforce the judgments and orders of courts in other Member States without examining the facts, and they will be subject to increasing criticism and public unease if there is no EU-wide compliance with minimal procedural safeguards and defence rights for criminal investigations and prosecutions. It is not just individual citizens who fear poor guarantees of rights; this also deters judges, but also police and prosecutors, from working together, too.
I happen to believe that the human rights assurance in European Arrest Warrants should be an explicit condition of extradition, even if the Commission hates that. Thanks to Liberal Democrats, the UK legislation implementing the measure says that the court must be satisfied there is no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Puzzlingly, British courts seem shy of invoking this clause to block surrender. Now if all Member States genuinely observed their obligations under the ECHR, there might be no need for EU measures. The problem is not the absence of standards but the absence of practical respect, and many Member States find themselves before the Strasbourg Court for this reason. Considering that the Treaty on European Union and now the TFEU obliges EU States to respect the ECHR, this is shameful and unacceptable. So we do need an EU mechanism for enforcement which, from now on, will be provided by Commission infringement competence and European Court of Justice supervision. So EU measures need both to be consistent with the ECHR and not conflict with or undermine it and, at the same time, to add value in the sense of strengthening practical implementation.
I hope the Commission and Council agree that the standard of directives guaranteeing fundamental rights should be high. The Member State initiative on interpretation and translation, proposing the text which the Council agreed on last October, is less ambitious than the Commission text and needs improving. So we are concerned that the first measure does not demonstrate the highest standards. I hope we will be more ambitious and set a precedent for the next stages in building up procedural rights which, after interpretation and translation, are followed by other measures like legal advice, right to information, right to communicate with consular authorities and so on. Therefore, I want reassurance from the Council and Commission that measures in the roadmap will be rolled out fast enough to keep up the momentum towards a genuine achievement of fair trial rights, long overdue.
I am pleased that this question has been tabled by Baroness Ludford, who spoke just now, Mrs Antonescu, Mrs Romero, Mrs Hautala and Mr Tavares, because we are indeed faced with a matter of overriding magnitude in the shape of procedural guarantees in criminal proceedings. On this subject, I would like to say that we agree on raising the profile of the matter you have brought to our attention and we also agree that it should be harmonised at European level.
In your question, you indicated at the outset that the Swedish Presidency made significant progress. The Swedish Presidency did indeed make important progress in this field. In October, the Council agreed on general guidelines for the text on the right to interpreting and translation in criminal proceedings and one month later, in November, the Council adopted a plan to make progress on further measures regarding procedural guarantees, in response to Baroness Ludford's call for action. Some of these you mentioned yourself, Baroness Ludford, such as the right to information on a person's rights - the repetition is intentional - and obligations in any criminal proceedings, on aid, on legal advice, on communication with family members and consular authorities, or on the special guarantees that must be put in place and the protection of vulnerable accused people. That was with regard to the Council during the Swedish Presidency.
The first thing that the Spanish Presidency will do is to try, by working with the European Parliament, to ensure the adoption of the Directive on interpreting and translation rights in criminal proceedings proposed by 13 Member States. It was not possible to continue with the proposal tabled by the Commission and 13 Member States have replaced this initiative. We want this initiative to be approved, naturally in cooperation with the European Parliament. Apart from this, we hope that the Commission will put the appropriate initiatives in place for the remaining aspects of procedural guarantees. We are very willing for this to happen as soon as possible so that we can start the process of adopting them, again in conjunction with the Council and Parliament.
I would like to end by telling you that the Spanish Presidency is planning to organise a seminar in Madrid this coming March, together with the Commission and the European Law Academy, on the subject of Common Standards in Procedural Guarantees. This shows, Baroness Ludford, that we agree wholeheartedly with you and those who supported this question on the urgency of regulating these matters, of harmonising them throughout Europe and, naturally, of keeping Parliament informed at all times on how the work is progressing.
Thank you for this question. You know how much I value these procedural guarantees. It is true that, for many years, the Commission has been fighting to ensure that minimum common rules relating to the right of defence are genuinely applied in all criminal proceedings in Europe. This is necessary for judicial cooperation and it is a condition for the vital mutual confidence among the Member States. The Commission has worked tirelessly to ensure that European legislation is adopted in this area. Moreover, it is true that, thanks to the Swedish Presidency, the roadmap was adopted by the Council on 30 November 2009. This is a fundamental step in the creation of European legislation on minimum procedural rights. The Member States have, through this act, agreed on the scope of this legislation and on the need to adopt it as a matter of priority in full cooperation with the European Parliament. Like you, I have just listened to Mr López Garrido, who gave a very good explanation of how the Spanish Presidency also tended towards this will to adopt these initial measures, which will provide us with a range of minimum guarantees.
It is true that the roadmap's step-by-step approach ultimately seemed to us to be a good solution. This approach will allow us to achieve our intended objective. The step-by-step approach means not only that a more thorough analysis can be made of each right in the context of the legislative proposal, but also that, in negotiations, each right can be examined individually. That allows us to avoid cross-sector bargaining, which sometimes characterises legislative texts that are too broad-based and can allow some Member States to hijack the negotiations in order to gain an advantage on a very specific point. So, Mrs Ludford, I am sure that the new Commission will work as quickly as possible to table all the legislative proposals provided for in the roadmap and to have them adopted at the earliest opportunity.
With regard to the right to interpretation and translation, which is the first provision of the roadmap, the Commission has noted the initiative presented by a number of Member States. This initiative, I must say, is based on the Commission's proposal of July 2009 and on the negotiations held within the Council during the second half of 2009. However, it is true that the Member States' initiative is not in full conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, or with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights.
Of course, there will be work in this area between the European Parliament and the Council, and I think we will be able to obtain an ambitious text regarding procedural rights. This is essential if we want to create a truly European judicial area. We will also ensure that the text complies with the standards laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Therefore, I am sure that we will be able to count on Parliament to act on this matter and, once again, I note that the Spanish Presidency will also lend us its support.
The importance of common standards is an essential condition for instilling mutual trust in the Member States' legal systems. The lack of balance between the rights of suspected and accused persons, on the one hand, and the instruments which the prosecution has available, on the other, may jeopardise the principle of mutual recognition of decisions. This is why the initiative launched by the Swedish Presidency in July 2009 to present a roadmap for consolidating the procedural rights of suspected or accused persons has marked a very important step forward.
We were concerned about the timetable and scope of application of the future initiatives on procedural rights. This is why we decided to submit these questions to the Commission and Council. Shortly after they were submitted in December, 13 Member States, including Romania, presented an initiative for a European Parliament and Council directive. I am confident that in the course of the whole process, we will manage to make improvements to this text, both with regard to its scope of application and to ensuring the integrity of the procedures and the quality of translation and interpretation.
Mr President, Mr Watson is absolutely right when he says that the European Parliament insisted right from the start that the European Arrest Warrant should be accompanied by clear minimum criminal procedural norms. We can now clearly see the sort of problems that many Member States are facing because the European Arrest Warrant was built on sand. It is indeed built on sand, because the assumption is that Member States should be able to rely on the legal systems of others: that the rule of law and norms relating to fair trials are a reality in the various Member States.
Just like some here before, I, too, could tell you stories about how that is not actually the case and how urgent it is that the Commission acts, just as my fellow Member proposed a moment ago. We need to establish a comprehensive system in which minimal rights in criminal procedures are taken forward. I believe that the Treaty of Lisbon will also allow us this opportunity, because now, the European Parliament is a fully competent legislator along with the Council, and it was very agreeable to hear Mr Barrot say that he had confidence in this partnership between the Commission and Parliament. The Commission and Parliament must now form an axis of power that truly overcomes resistance on the part of the Member States that have been unwilling to make progress in this matter.
I promised to tell you a story about what happens if the rule of law is not adhered to but the European Arrest Warrant system is. In Finland at present, there is a Chechen couple, Hadižat and Malik Gataev, who have been detained. They arrived from Lithuania where, for years, they kept an orphanage for the child victims of the war in Chechnya and, as it turns out, in Chechnya, the security police interrupted their activities on the pretext that there may have been some minor connection with violence in the family; it was perhaps mainly family-related and so not anything actually approaching serious assault, for example. Now this couple is in Finland. They are applying for asylum and Lithuania is demanding their extradition. The case is being heard next Monday at the Helsinki District Court.
What on earth is one to do in this situation, given that the basic notion here is that Finland should be able to rely on the fact that in Lithuania, this couple will have a fair trial? We have very hard evidence that that has not actually been the case, and I would say that there are any number of examples of everyday cases such as this, where the European Arrest Warrant has actually been meaningless. We must be able to make progress in this matter, as, otherwise, it will be completely impossible for us to build the trust between Member States that will inevitably be required if we are to engage in judicial cooperation.
Mr President, I, too, will give an example, as Mrs Hautala has done. A certain young man from Poland was sentenced in Great Britain to life imprisonment for rape, in a trial based on circumstantial evidence, which took place under the influence of a strong smear campaign in the press and which, in the opinion of some observers, did not meet Polish standards, at any rate, for a fair trial. The man is now serving his life sentence in a prison in Poland, although Polish law does not provide for a life sentence for rape, only for murder - rape carries a maximum sentence of 12 years. We have, therefore, a situation in which there is someone in a Polish prison who has been given a sentence which is not in accord with the principles of Polish law.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - I speak tonight because, as has been mentioned, two constituents - Michael Turner and Jason McGoldrick - are imprisoned in Unit 2 of the Central Budapest jail in Hungary. They have been imprisoned since 3 November and they are yet to be tried. There is, in fact, no trial date. The terms of imprisonment are burdensome. They are separated and have no contact with each other. They share a small cell with three other prisoners. They are confined to their cells 23 hours a day. They are permitted three telephone calls and one shower a week. They are allowed one family visit per month.
(HU) As a Hungarian and a criminal lawyer, I should be ashamed because today, here in the EU Parliament, on the subject of the lack of procedural guarantees in criminal proceedings, two of my fellow Members, who otherwise represent two different political views, have mentioned Hungary as a flagrant example. Though I am ashamed, I have to agree with them because I myself have had similar experiences. I ask them, and all you, the few Members still present here during the discussion of this important topic, to consider the following: if they have come to know of such serious infringements of the law in cases of foreigners who are politically quite irrelevant to the Hungarian State and Hungarian Government, what may be the fate of those who are opponents of the Hungarian Government, let us say because they are politically opposed to the government?
There are currently 15 persons in jail under preliminary arrest for having tried to take a stand against the corrupt dealings of the Hungarian Government. In retaliation, criminal proceedings were brought against them on trumped up charges of terrorism. To this day, not a single piece of evidence has been presented; the authorities feel no obligation to point to any kind of evidence. They are in custody under the same conditions that you have heard, shut off from their families, from public view and from the press. Please, let us join together and do something in order to normalise the situation in Hungary and make it impossible to take advantage of the lack of procedural guarantees in criminal proceedings, especially for political reasons. Hungary must institute such guarantees.
In principle, the draft framework decision defines a set of fundamental procedural rights in criminal proceedings, namely the right to legal advice, the right to interpretation and translation, the right to specific attention in sensitive areas, and the right to communicate and cooperate with consular authorities. This list of fundamental rights should be considered strictly demonstrative because the role of the European Union is to ensure that Member States respect the broadest possible range of fundamental rights, also with a view to Member States' membership in the Council of Europe and with a reference to its Convention.
The Committee calls for the Council to continue work in introducing common European procedural rights in criminal matters. An existing common procedure in the form of the European Arrest Warrant has removed the centuries-old safeguards against unjust arrest and imprisonment that the English used to enjoy. This is not an academic argument. The EAW is destroying innocent people's lives. My constituent, Andrew Symeou, is just one of a growing number of people extradited without an English court having the power to consider the prima facie evidence against them and to prevent unjust extradition. Extradition has now been reduced to a mere bureaucratic formality. Mr Symeou has been held for six months in the notorious Korydallos prison without bail or prospect of trial. The political cynicism of the British Liberal Democrats is truly breathtaking. They now cry crocodile tears in London over Mr Symeou's fate despite having been materially responsible for the common procedures that caused it and while here, they work for more of the same legislation. The common procedures are about lowering European legal standards and not raising them.
(EL) Mr President, it is crucial that we progress as far as possible with the creation of a common European reference framework for procedural rights during the dispensation of justice. The key concept is the concept of trust. We want European citizens taking recourse to justice to be confident that their fundamental rights will be protected. We also want trust between the Member States in terms of their cooperation and the ultimate dispensation of justice to each person called to account. Finally, we need trust from all of us in terms of the dispensation of justice. As long as we fail to promote these common frameworks at European level, whether we like it or not, there will sometimes be some crimes which exploit the loopholes and ultimately, we shall not achieve the dispensation of justice we are striving for precisely because no such frameworks exist.
All the speakers and all the Parliamentary groups agree on the need to draw up a genuine European law on procedural guarantees. This illustrates the importance and need for the European integration process and the importance of a citizens' Europe, of a European judicial area and of implementing the Lisbon Treaty. This subject is the focus of the Spanish Presidency's programme for the next six months and has received indubitable support in all the speeches I have heard, based on a variety of arguments and seen from different perspectives: the need to move towards harmonised procedural guarantees.
I would like to make one final point about the European Arrest Warrant. The European Arrest Warrant has been brought up only to criticise it. I wish to say that the European Arrest Warrant is a fundamental example of European Union and of cooperation against organised crime in the European Union. I am entitled to shout this from the rooftops, coming as I do from a country like Spain, which still suffers from terrorism and for which the European Arrest Warrant is an essential weapon in the struggle against terrorism.
Mr President, the Minister is right, and Mr Coelho put it very well earlier when he said, 'a Europe of security, a Europe of justice'. Yes, Mr Watson, the European arrest warrant has been very effective and very useful, even if it is true that, at the same time, we need to get the European judicial area up and running, and it is in this area that we must work for this Europe of justice, so that there really is confidence in the way in which justice is provided throughout Europe.
In this regard, I would like once again to thank the authors of the question and indeed to tell them again that, on the basis of the text that reflects the general approach of the Council of 23 October 2009, the Commission, with the help of the European Parliament and the Spanish Presidency, will ensure that this is a higher quality text than the current one. I would add that we will obviously be careful to formulate all the necessary legislative proposals in due course, so that no initiatives are necessary on the part of the Member States.
I firmly believe that opinions have changed and that, with the multiannual Stockholm Programme, we really have an obligation to produce results in this area. Moreover, I have to say that, since I have had these responsibilities, I have done everything possible to make progress with this issue of procedural guarantees, and, although we have chosen a step-by-step formula, I believe that we are now well on our way. I would like to thank the European Parliament and the Spanish Presidency, convinced as I am that a Europe of justice will make significant progress in 2010.
I would like to inform the House that I have received a letter from the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, in which he informs me of the European Council's decision to consult the European Parliament on the proposal by the Spanish Government concerning the composition of the European Parliament and to seek Parliament's consent not to convene a Convention on this matter. It concerns the 18 additional Members of the European Parliament. I have handed the proposal to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has just begun work on this matter and will shortly appoint a rapporteur. Work on this will continue.
I would also like to tell you that, following the Bulgarian Government's decision to withdraw its candidate for Commissioner-designate, it has put forward a new candidate. The Conference of Presidents will decide tomorrow on the final timetable, but the most likely date for the hearing of the new Commissioner-designate is 3 February, with the vote on 9 February. This, of course, also depends on a decision from Mr Barroso and on his talks with the Bulgarian Government's newly appointed candidate. Nothing has yet been established, but I wanted the House to have this general information about what our next steps will be. At all events, the European Parliament is in full control of the situation. There are no exceptional situations here, and we are acting in accordance with democratic procedures. These procedures are of fundamental significance to us and this is how the European Parliament will always work under my Presidency.
I would also like to tell you about how the European Parliament envisages working with the two-and-a-half-year permanent Presidency of the European Union and the European Council and how it will work with the rotating Presidency. The rotating Presidency, in this case the Spanish Presidency, will always present its six-month plan of action at the beginning of the six-month period and will then present a report of its work at the end of the period. The permanent Presidency of the European Council will present the results of its work at European summits. As you know, in every six-month period, there are two summits, and the President of the European Council will present the results of the summit twice in each period, hence, four times a year.
This has not been done before for the following reason, given to us by the Commission: the Commission has not finished the relevant translations and, therefore, the Council has not received them from the Commission. As I have just told you, these different language versions are still being finished, and as you know, the Council can only pass that document, that agreement, to Parliament, when the different language versions are available, which the Commission has in hand. This is what will be produced on 25 January.
Furthermore, for the future and with a view to an agreement, not provisional, but definitive, the Commission intends to make recommendations in that regard for the formation of a long-term agreement, not an agreement which finishes in October of next year, such as the one we are talking about, but one for the long term. This long-term agreement must be negotiated and entered into according to new legal bases, as provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, in which the European Parliament has full involvement. The European Parliament already has full involvement in those agreements, and that is how it will be for the forthcoming agreement, upon which the Commission has not yet made any recommendations.
To finish, I want to say that this is a matter of extreme importance. This is a procedure, a programme to combat terrorism. The Detroit incident has shown that there is present danger, that the threat persists and, therefore, the Member States must not allow that continuing flow of financial data to the TFTP to be abandoned. Judge Bruguière explained this in his in camera intervention filmed before this Parliament in November. He said that, in his opinion, several Member States had been able to benefit and take advantage of the information which was provided to the United States to uncover and avoid terrorist activities.
This led the Council, during the previous Swedish Presidency, to make a provisional application for a new agreement, to avoid the expiry of the current one on 31 January and, therefore, the cancellation of any possible flow of information. It was the only option that the Council had to do so and, of course, yes, Parliament's position on obtaining information is understandable. This has not been produced, as I have told you, due to the European Commission's delay in producing the relevant translations.
Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, this whole debate was, of course, initially coloured by the frustration and irritation that many people in the European Parliament felt because we had the impression that, once again, things were being rushed through in the Council before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. For that reason, I am now thankful that the Council has realised that it is good to consult Parliament, to now apply the new Treaty of Lisbon in the ratification process and also to give us the opportunity to assess whether this agreement is to be applied or not.
In this legislative process, if we now start it, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will apply clear decision-making criteria. There are two sides to the coin. On one side, we as the PPE Group hold the clear principle that for European data - wherever this is stored - European data protection standards should apply. We hold the principle that we want a right of appeal for people who feel they have been unfairly treated in being subjected to data checks. We hold the basic principle that data should be passed on only in individual cases and only if the person is suspected of something, not simply as a general rule. These are things that we regard as important.
On the other side of the coin, there is the fact that we, of course, want cooperation with the United States. We want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror. We do not want a situation in which individual states - if agreements expire - are put under particular pressure, like Belgium for example, because then states might start to operate on a bilateral basis. Careful consideration is also needed here. As the PPE Group, we will give consideration to this when the legislative proposal is presented.
The essence of the matter is something else entirely: the lack of involvement of the European Parliament. In the case of international agreements of such far-reaching importance, that is simply impermissible. We want Parliament to be genuinely involved from day one in the implementation of this agreement. Why is that? Mr Buzek, the President of this House, worded it very precisely in his letter, saying that the SWIFT agreement provides for far-reaching infringements of citizens' fundamental freedoms, which are constitutionally guaranteed in most Member States and are also guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
However, if there are to be executive measures on the basis of such an agreement that provide for infringements of citizens' fundamental freedoms, the legal protection of citizens against such infringements must be absolutely guaranteed. That means that data protection must be guaranteed in every respect, the deletion of data after a certain, reasonable period must be guaranteed and appeal facilities must be precisely set out for citizens in the event of the violation of their fundamental rights. One of the constituent elements of the principle of the rule of law is that citizens are able to protect themselves against arbitrary treatment on the part of the State.
Therefore, this undue haste, - or a 'pig's gallop', as we would call it in German - this pressure to speed things up, is incomprehensible and so our unanimous request to the Council must be put very precisely: send us the relevant documents! We will debate this matter and conclude the parliamentary procedure with the necessary speed because we want security, but not only for the security bodies; we want security for the citizens who are supposed to be protected by these security bodies, too. I believe that is the purpose of this agreement, but in that case, we also want it to be enacted as an appropriate law.
Mr President, all of Parliament's frustration is now raining down on the Spanish Presidency, which has only just taken up office. Accept it on behalf of the Council as a whole, but I still consider you, yourselves, to be involved in this. I am annoyed that there are no representatives of the Commission in seats 21 and 22 because, if I understand it correctly, the Commission would have had a duty to expedite this whole matter once Parliament had been asked to set the approval procedure in motion. However, the Commission is avoiding its responsibilities and has stayed away from the debate.
I do not want to repeat what my fellow Members have said, but I would like to say that I think it would be extremely dangerous for the Council to have this provisional SWIFT agreement enter into force without Parliament having first voted on what you intend to present to us. I consider the procedure - if you continue to push this through by 1 February at breakneck speed, or at a pig's gallop, as Mr Schulz quite rightly described the whole procedure - not only to be a provocation of Parliament, but also a violation of the treaties, a violation of the Treaty of Lisbon, after it has only just entered into force, and that is irresponsible.
I would like to emphasise once again that the citizens of the EU are watching with interest to see how we respond to the highly acclaimed Treaty of Lisbon. If we do not, at this point, ensure parliamentary control, if we accept this breach of national data protection laws and contravene the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was so often cited in the debate about the Treaty of Lisbon, it will, I believe, be a kind of kamikaze action and completely unjustifiable. However, Mr López Garrido, you share the responsibility for this with the Commission.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, recent events have once again reminded us all how important it is that we share information in order to ensure the security of EU citizens. SWIFT has been a valuable tool in achieving this. Luckily, having met with US Government officials, particularly Mr David Cohen, the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing in the US Treasury Department, recently in Washington, I was reassured by the multi-layered control systems and safeguards and independent oversight which I hope will lead to the implementation of this new agreement being beyond reproach.
Where I must express grave concern, as others have done, is in the Council's substandard consultation with Parliament, and alleged Commission delays. It is essential that Parliament and the elected representatives of this House are frequently and properly informed, and parliamentary consent must not be a retrospective tool. For the Council to treat it as such undermines the values and democratic principles that lie at the heart of this Chamber and this Parliament. I do hope that the Council, and indeed the Presidency, will take careful note of these remarks.
(DE) Mr President, very many measures have been adopted under the guise of combating terrorism in recent years, including by the Council. However, very many of these measures are not reasonably proportionate to the actual threat posed by terrorism. On the contrary, they have resulted in unacceptable restrictions of citizens rights. The systematic exchange of data, unrelated to any grounds for suspicion, provided for in the SWIFT agreement is clearly no exception to this. Even the German Federal Criminal Police Office, which is not really known as a data protection group, had to admit the disproportionate nature of this measure. We must put a stop to these permanent restrictions of citizens' rights and we must not approve the provisional agreement.
There was a particular intervention, I think it was Mrs Harms, referring to the possible publication of one of the language versions. Obviously, I do not have that information. I will check it out and let you know the situation in writing. What I have told you is that on 25 January, the agreement which will come into force provisionally on 1 February will be in the hands of the European Parliament. In accordance with European law, in accordance with Article 218 of the Treaty of Lisbon and in accordance with the Vienna Convention, signed agreements can provisionally come into force. Therefore, it is valid.
For the European Union and, of course, for the Council, it is important that this agreement remains in force. It is important that these agreements on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme remain in force. We feel that it is a positive step, that it serves the struggle against terrorism, and that it involves collaboration with the United States, which is a trustworthy country, a partner country, a neighbour, which has the same purpose as ourselves: the fight against terrorism. This has nothing to do with the delay in receiving the language versions, it is definitely not an excuse, Mr Schulz. It is not a matter of gaining time, Mr Weber.
As you know, a few weeks ago, or months even, the Swedish Presidency, the Council, suggested sending this version in a single language to Parliament, from the Council, and the Commission realised that this was not possible, that it had to be the actual Commission which would produce the language versions and send them all on. The Council had good intentions on the part of the Swedish Presidency, but it was not possible either legally or technically. That is the reason it has arrived now. I understand that the European Parliament would have liked to have this version earlier. I agree absolutely. If I had been an MEP, I would think exactly the same and would have wanted to have these versions earlier. It did not happen that way for the reason I told you. It has nothing to do with gaining time, or hiding anything, nor is it an excuse. Absolutely not.
I think this is an agreement where the European Parliament will have the full capacity to take part, because the Lisbon Treaty has come into force and we have - I think a great majority of us - adopted that treaty, and that will give Parliament the capacity to take part in a sovereign way. Parliament will be able to, if it wishes, cut short the validity of this provisional agreement. Parliament will take part in the negotiation of the subsequent long-term agreement. The EP, together with the Council, of course, will have all the authority to influence the SWIFT Agreement which we believe is very important, which deserves to be debated in this Parliament, thoroughly, seriously and without haste or pressure, to use an expression that you, yourselves, have already used.
What is more, we are absolutely agreed, Mr Verhofstadt and other speakers, that here it is necessary to respect people's fundamental rights, the right to privacy and European legislation on data protection. Moreover, now we have another instrument to guarantee these rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which has just come into force because it is linked to the Lisbon Treaty, and that is fully in force. One of the rights that it guarantees is the right to privacy and data protection. Therefore, we have all the conditions to make a good agreement.
(DE) Mr President, I apologise for taking the floor once again. It is a rare event in my life, but we are not at a fun fair here. Mr López Garrido, the agreement was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 13 January. You are not responsible for that, but if you now say to us 'I need first to find out which language versions are available' then I have to say again that this is not a recreational event for the mutual enjoyment of MEPs and ministers. This is a legislative chamber in which serious work is required!
I would now like to say something to you - not to the Spanish Presidency, but to the Council - and that is that the way in which the Council has dealt with these matters shows that it has no regard for Parliament whatsoever. The time has now come for us to say to the Council that these little games are finished. There is a serious legislative procedure - in Europe, this, of course, involves all documents and all dossiers being available in all languages at the start of the procedure and does not mean that we have to go in search of the documents with a divining rod after the procedure has supposedly finished. This is not a sound procedure. I ask you now to tell us which language versions were available when the agreement was published in the Official Journal on 13 January. That is something that I am now formally requesting to know on behalf of our group.
I do not believe that the Council has treated the European Parliament in a humiliating manner, nor has it in any way denied Parliament information. I am referring to the Swedish Presidency which, at the time, did what it could in order to be able to submit the agreement, but that was not legally possible because some of the language versions had still not been translated. Now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, the European Parliament will be able to discuss this matter fully, and the Council is ready to provide Parliament with all the information it requires and to establish a dialogue on the matter.
What is being referred to as the SWIFT agreement (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) governs the passing on of data from the global bank network. On a daily basis, 8 000 monetary institutions from 200 countries communicate with each other via the channels of the society, which is based in Belgium, with data centres in the Netherlands and the US. According to the Commission, requests for data can only relate to international transfers and use of the service is strictly limited to terrorism investigations by the secret services. However, both high-ranking politicians and criminal experts doubt that, in the US, the data would be used solely for combating terrorist activities. Data abuse, violations of civil rights and the passing on of data to third parties are all very real dangers that could result from the SWIFT agreement. As Members of the European Parliament, we absolutely must not allow the entry into force of this agreement and the associated data transfer to the US, and certainly not without the approval of the European Parliament. Provisional entry into force of the agreement pending the debate in the European Parliament in February would constitute a huge violation of the fundamental principle of democracy.
Therefore, Turkey must fulfil these requirements. There are several chapters open for possible negotiation. Some are open, others are not yet open, other negotiations are stalled, and it is plain that Turkey is of great strategic importance to the Union. Firstly, because it is a country which has a European perspective and, furthermore, because it is a large country of growing strategic importance from the point of view of energy supply and it is a country with unquestionable economic and also, of course, political relevance. Turkey, by the way, is part of NATO and, therefore, in that respect, for some of the countries of the European Union, Turkey is also an associate in the sphere of that military alliance.
It must be said that Turkey has experienced positive changes. The European perspective has given Turkey particular motivation to follow a path, in a positive sense, towards democratising changes and democratic consolidation. The current Turkish Government has even launched what it calls the 'democratic initiative' as a response to the need for a series of institutional changes to the Turkish political system en route to its democratisation. In relation to the European Union, its interest has even been demonstrated within the government, with the appointment of Minister Bağış, to whom I have spoken many times, specifically responsible for negotiation with the European Union, which is his portfolio.
This actually happened on the occasion of the decision adopted on 11 December by the Turkish Constitutional Court to dissolve the DTP (Demokratik Toplum Partisi) and to prevent a number of its democratically elected representatives from carrying out any political activity. The Presidency of the Council expressed its concern about that decision adopted by the Court at the time and there has clearly been a voice from the European Union sharply pointing out its concern at that decision. Furthermore, that voice is encouraging the necessary reforms in Turkish legislation to adapt the regulation on political parties to certain recommendations formulated by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe and the relevant regulations of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which, by the way, has been signed and ratified by the Turkish State and submitted to the jurisdiction, in this case, of the Strasbourg Court.
Hence I conclude, Madam President. The Presidency of the Council will continue giving much importance to this matter. Every aspect of the reform process currently taking place in Turkey will be closely followed and, in any case, within a framework which we consider to be positive, which is a framework of negotiation and association for membership. We think this is a strategic framework that we must continue with, and the intention of the current Spanish Presidency of the Council is that new avenues of negotiation should continue to open up and therefore, as happened last year with Turkey, we would be able to go into depth in those negotiations.
The democratic opening of Turkey in relation to the Kurdish population is an example of such a development. In the summer of 2009, the Turkish Government launched this democratic opening aimed at raising democratic and living standards for all Turkish citizens. This important initiative addresses the Kurdish issue through dialogue and within the framework of Turkish democratic institutions. A number of landmark reforms have been carried out to date. Some of these were next to impossible only a few years ago: think of the Kurdish-language TV programmes, which are now broadcast by private and public broadcasters. They are a telling example of such welcome changes and transformation.
But the recent setbacks in the democratic opening are, indeed, reason for serious concern. We regret the decision of the Constitutional Court of Turkey in December to close the Democratic Society Party (DTP). Following the closure of the DTP, several party members - including elected mayors - were arrested in the context of an anti-terror investigation. Simultaneously, PKK terrorist attacks continue unabated in the south-east and put the lives of Turkish soldiers at risk. The tense political climate has also been fuelled by celebrations in the wake of the return of PKK members and sympathisers from northern Iraq. Nationalist circles in Turkey have seized this opportunity to attack the government on its policies and on the democratic opening itself.
President-in-Office of the Council, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is not about opening chapters. It is about democratisation - certain aspects of democratisation, in particular - as the progress report on Turkey and Parliament's vision are on the agenda for the next part-session in Strasbourg. I agree with Commissioner Rehn that it is terribly important that Turkey move towards democracy. I should like to congratulate Turkey emphatically on all the efforts it has already made in this field, including with regard to the Kurdish issue. After all, who would have thought 10 years ago, five years ago even, that there would now be television programmes in Kurdish?
When, in mid-2009, Turkey launched what it called the 'democratic opening' initiative, this produced an unprecedented debate - not only a debate in the parliament, but also an unprecedented debate in the media. At that time, I hoped that debate would produce very tangible, firmly rooted rights for all Turkish citizens at long last. In October, I congratulated all my Turkish counterparts on daring to hold that debate in spite of public opposition. I have called on them to follow the debate with very specific measures to flesh out this opening. Following all the positive energy that had been put into this, however, Turkey's dark side then reared its head again, as the ruling of the Turkish Constitutional Court brought renewed terrorist attacks. There was a wave of arrests of Democratic Society Party (DTP) members, and the threat of arrest still hangs over members of the Turkish Parliament. This also threatens to put an end to this opening and I have a nasty feeling about this. Whilst I regret the decision of the Constitutional Court, I understand that the same Court is calling for the implementation of the recommendations of the Venice Commission. This House has always condemned violence and terrorism, and has argued in favour of political solutions. After all, only dialogue within Turkish society and legally guaranteed sustainable rights can bring peace, security and prosperity for Turkish citizens, and will also be of great benefit to us.
Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, regret the ruling of the Turkish Constitutional Court. Clearly, this is a step backwards, but let us hope that it is only one backward step and that it will be followed by several steps forward, as we must also recognise that the current Turkish Government has made clear efforts to set democratisation in motion and also to give the Kurds their rightful place in society and in the political system. I would point out, though, that if we want to support this process of democratisation, development and reform in Turkey, we need to make an unambiguous commitment to Turkey's full membership. I believe that we need to give the Turkish people, too - not just the Turkish political class - a shot in the arm, and that we should not waver, discuss interim solutions or move the goalposts during the game. We must make an unambiguous commitment. This also goes for all the Turkish political parties, and so I wish to call on them to bury the hatchet in this regard and make concerted efforts towards reform.
On a recent visit to the country as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I noticed enormous progress within civil society. After all, Turkey is more than just the politicians and negotiators; it is also the people. I see that the Turkish people are indeed taking up the challenge and are working hard to reform their own society. We must give this our wholehearted support. Therefore, I would urge the strengthening of the pillar that was agreed back then: not only the negotiations, but also the investment in getting to know each other. That was explicitly the second strand. I hope that this House will also make an unambiguous commitment to supporting the accession process.
This Kurdish issue is also placing a huge strain on the democratisation process. It is placing a strain on freedom of expression, on freedom of the press, on the rights of citizens and on the fight against torture. And when I see today how anti-terrorism legislation is being used as a cover for political reprisals, I say that now really is the time when we have to support the government and expect it to take another extremely ambitious initiative to emerge from this situation because, as we know, not all the established groups in Turkey are interested in a democratic settlement of the Kurdish issue. We are well aware of this fact, as we have been since the beginning.
However, the AKP's mildly Islamist leanings also give rise to concern in the views of some, and the party's popularity tends to indicate a fundamental paradigm shift in the nature of Turkish society. Until now, the secular Kemalist tradition has served Turkey's Euro-Atlantic leanings very well, but its gradual decline due to demographic changes would tend to indicate that those who believe in the power of Ataturk's vision have rather taken it too much for granted. For the good of Turkish society, democracy needs to be pluralist, secular and built on a bed-rock of respect for human rights, including those of its Kurdish minorities.
Turkey has turned into a graveyard for political parties. Thirteen parties have been buried by Supreme Court judgments. Recently, the DTP was banned; 200 party members, nine mayors, six formers mayors and two former party leaders are in jail. Is there a trend towards democratisation in such a state because there is television in the Kurdish language? We are Turkey's neighbours and we call on you to learn from our experiences as neighbours, not from our weak points. Turkey will be democratised if we talk to it clearly and strictly.
There is no doubt that Turkey is a large Muslim country of huge strategic importance. I have no wish to repeat the views of other members which I agree with. However, the analysis of the information relating to this country gives me the impression that there are numerous centres of power which are unable to act jointly and contradict each other. Thus, while the Erdoğan government is trying to present itself as moderate, the armed forces of the countries appear to be aggressive both towards Greece, constantly violating Greek airspace, and constantly harassing Frontex.
This also applies to Turkey, which must implement those reforms that are necessary to guarantee democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights and the rights of minorities. In particular, cultural, religious and political pluralism are the foundations of a democratic society, but recognising them is a difficult process which is intertwined with historical, ethnic and religious considerations. The events surrounding the Turkish Constitutional Court's ban on the Democratic Society Party, a party close to the Kurdish minority, are one example of this. It follows that the banning of parties and the removal of elected representatives from office are always very serious events because they violate individual freedoms and democratic principles.
(ES) It seems to me that one can say quite forcefully that, since membership negotiations began with Turkey, on the basis of a unanimous agreement of the Council, the process as a whole merits a positive assessment. It has helped the democratisation and modernisation process in Turkey. However, it is also obvious that there are a multitude of problems, there are forward and backward steps, there is bad news from time to time - the recent ban on the Kurdish party, the DTP, is an example - and that we have a long road of enormous complexity ahead of us.
Here, in this Parliament, we are used to saying what others should do. I think that it would be a good idea for us to state also, with a view to future negotiations with Turkey, what our majority stance is. I think that this is reflected in the report by Ria Oomen-Ruijten, which has a large majority and is in favour of not establishing a criterion of two weights and two measures in the process of negotiation, of being firm and clear in our intentions and not giving out contradictory messages, because this could really nurture a vicious circle in which European reluctance, ambiguities, and contradictions could provide fodder for reactionaries or those who are against Turkey's membership of Europe, nationalist groups or suchlike who are against integration into Europe.
The continued failure to reform the constitution, the Law on Political Parties and the judiciary, as well as the continued involvement of the military in politics, all influence the context in which Kurdish democratic political representation is repeatedly sabotaged. These closures also sabotage the democratic opening launched last year by the Erdoğan government, which was, rightly, widely welcomed. The only way to get a durable settlement to the Kurdish question in Turkey is through a political solution, and that is the best way to combat the PKK.
Commissioner Rehn talked about several mayors and DTP politicians being arrested, but my information is that about 1 200 activists are in prison, including members of the BDP party, which has succeeded the DTP. I am not clear at all how the government intends to strengthen its democratic opening in this context. Who is calling the shots on these arrests? I have heard it said - I think it was by Richard Howitt - that Prime Minister Erdoğan did condemn the DTP closure, although I confess I missed that development. A cynic might say that, electorally, it suits the AKP party rather well to have the DTP closed, as they are electoral rivals in the south-east.
(CS) I am speaking from the position of someone who supports Turkey's membership of the European Union as a fully-fledged member, and not as a substitute or a kind of privileged partner; and I would like to add a few critical words levelled at our own ranks. We perceive Turkey from the position of an organisation which has promised that country full membership of the European Union but which, at the same time, is unable to guarantee that if it does meet all the conditions we are demanding from it, it will really achieve full membership.
The position of the European Parliament in this matter is clear. The institution has expressed its clear-cut approval; the stance of the European Commission is also clear and, in this respect, I can only join in praising Commissioner Rehn for his objectivity and for the great job he has done in this cause over the past five years. The position of the European Council is not that clear, because there are still governments of some Member States that simply refuse to make it quite clear that as long as Turkey meets all the conditions we require of it, it can become a fully-fledged member of the European Union. In this case, we are involved in double dealing and becoming untrustworthy; and we can hardly ask for something from someone to whom we are unable to guarantee that we will meet our own promises.
Secondly, Turkish democracy is simply quite specific in its own right. While we justifiably urge that country to bring its standards closer to European standards, while we justifiably call, for example, for the role of its army to be limited, we should also realise what this is going to mean and what impact this is going to have on the structure of Turkish society and on the entire nature of Turkish democracy. I am afraid that our mechanical evaluation of the criteria for democratisation could eventually do more harm than good, and I would advocate more sensitivity, more responsiveness, and more empathy for Turkey in this matter.
(DA) Commissioner Rehn, in my headphones, you were translated as saying that the journey is just as important as the destination. I have to say that I completely disagree with that. Only that part of the journey that leads towards a democratic Turkey can be supported. In contrast, we must speak out against any part of the journey that leads in the wrong direction. Words must also be accompanied by action. I would like to know how long the Commission will accept part of the EU's accession support to Turkey being used to reward the political allies of the governing party while ethnic and religious minorities are discriminated against, as a recent investigation has shown. The EU should do something about it!
EU-Turkey relations go back a long way and are mutually beneficial. Like other candidate countries, of course, Turkey also has to comply with the principles of democracy, freedom and human rights and to adopt its legislative system to the acquis communautaire. I would like to join my colleagues who have welcomed the progress made by Turkey so far, but also to recognise that a number of hindrances remain on Turkey's road to accession: freedom of expression and the rights of the Kurdish minority, described by colleagues, are examples.
I wish also to express my concern in relation to the decision by the Turkish Constitutional Court to close the Democratic Society Party and to ban a number of its democratically elected representatives, but this should not be a reason to delay the accession negotiations with Turkey. The European perspective is a driving force for democratic reforms. The lack of our commitment would send a negative signal to the Turkish people. Our uncertainty has a cost. It could undermine the democratic process under way. EU policy should never be driven by fear. We Europeans should support the reforms. They will take time, they will be complex and there will be setbacks, but we should never waver on the Copenhagen criteria. We should never waver on our commitment to Turkey's membership. There has to be a clear light at the end of the tunnel.
(NL) Madam President, Turkey must be treated fairly. This means that the European Union must also take an honest look in the mirror. The Copenhagen criteria, with which everyone is familiar, are the important things here. These must be met. The accession process is an open-ended process, which was also stated when we opened accession negotiations. This means that the criteria are key; they will determine whether Turkey can proceed to accession. Democracy is vital, of course. This means that the EU must also make every effort to support democratisation in Turkey. It is very strange, then, to note that the pre-accession programme, the programme for pre-accession aid, is being poorly implemented. The Court of Auditors of the European Union has stated very clearly that too many priorities have been laid down, which means no priorities, and has pointed in particular to the aid for democratisation. I should like to hear the Commission's opinion on the Court of Auditors' criticism, and what it will do to ensure that pre-accession aid is properly organised.
I will just say a word about the PKK, because it continues with its terrorist activities. What is clear is that the PKK continues not only as a terrorist organisation but also with its criminal networks, which extend beyond Turkey throughout Europe. The PKK is like a mafia, with a structure carrying out criminal activity, raising funds and bolstering support. It is involved in every aspect of organised crime: tax evasion, counterfeiting money, trafficking of human beings - and the narcotics trade, of course, is one of its key sources of funding. It just seems to me that we ought to be concentrating on doing more to overcome problems such as that in our own countries and helping the Turks in that way, rather than constantly sniping at them and criticising them.
(DE) Madam President, I would like once again to point out that the Kurdish Democratic Society Party ban means that a total of 27 Kurdish parties have been banned by the Turkish Government in recent years. Since the ban - we have only just heard about this - more than a thousand people have been arrested. I think that, in a country in which parties are routinely banned, it is no longer possible to talk of democracy. The prohibition of 27 Kurdish parties almost constitutes an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of Records.
It is not only about the minorities in Turkey - and this is something that I would also like to mention again at this point. There is currently a strike being held by tobacco workers at the firm Tekel that is very intense and is now escalating. Several thousand workers went on hunger strike today in order to enforce their rights. They feel they have been severely oppressed by the Turkish Government and the Turkish authorities. This aspect must be taken into account, because the protection of the rights of workers and trade unions is an integral part of democracy. The trade unions, but also the minorities, in Turkey are awaiting a clear and unambiguous opinion from this House.
The position of the Patriarchate has already been mentioned here. Orthodox believers have suffered discrimination and there are probably now only around 3 000 of them in Turkey. It is a totally incomprehensible law that says that Orthodox priests, bishops and patriarchs must be Turkish citizens. A patriarch is the head of a worldwide church, so he, of course, may be elected from any member church. Similarly, there must be a guarantee of the protection of church property, and property that has been seized illegally must be returned. A list of names has been compiled here in this House with a position in writing adopted in favour of opening the clerical Seminary of Halki. The last person to appeal to have the Halki Seminary opened was President Barack Obama.
(NL) Madam President, the Turkish Government has launched the democratic initiative to democratise the country and improve Kurdish cultural rights. This was a courageous step forward. Banning political parties is a large step back, however. A democratic state based on the rule of law must always allow discussion to take place democratically, with all citizens able to make their voices heard. The ban on the Democratic Society Party (DTP) is not conducive to the success of this democratic initiative. Eighteen months ago, the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) narrowly escaped the same fate. I expect Turkey to amend its constitution as soon as possible in compliance with the criteria drawn up by the Venice Commission, to preclude the banning of political parties. All parties must be involved in this; after all, the same fate could befall them. In addition, a party system that results in better representation of the Turkish population must be introduced. This can be done by drastically reducing the 10% electoral threshold. The use of party bans as a stake in a political game must be prevented. Turkey will have to work towards this, with Europe's support, immediately and without delay. It remains for me to thank Commissioner Rehn for his tremendous cooperation. I wish him every success with his new portfolio.
This development must continue. That is why Turkey should be welcomed into the EU fold. Far too many in Parliament and among EU governments are trying to wriggle out of the promises given to Turkey as a candidate country. That is dishonourable and creates uncertainty not just in Turkey, but also in other candidate countries. Naturally, Turkey cannot join the EU until all the criteria are met. The EU must set strict criteria but, at the same time, support the country so that it can in fact meet these criteria.
May I also take up another matter connected with Turkish membership. I believe that my fellow Member from Denmark has already touched upon this. Last week, Radio Sweden reported on an audit that had revealed major shortcomings in how EU funds are used in Turkey. The money is not getting to those who need it most. There has also been criticism of poor follow-up and the fact that the rural population - minorities such as Kurds and Assyrians - are not sharing in the EU's aid. Women have also been treated unfairly. The rules for applying for project funding are complex and difficult to understand. My fellow Member, Mr Färm, and I have asked Mr Rehn to get to the bottom of this during his final days as Commissioner for Enlargement. We expect a rapid response. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Rehn for his excellent work as Commissioner for Enlargement and wish him good luck in his new post.
(NL) Madam President, the democratic opening announced by the Turkish Government has degenerated into a democratic negation. The ban on the Democratic Society Party (DTP) has destroyed, and thus negated, the Kurdish people's freedom of expression, of association and of political participation for the umpteenth time. The lack of democracy, the prominent role of both army and police, the very high electoral threshold of 10%, the failure to reform both the constitution and the law on political parties, the persecution and imprisonment of Kurdish politicians and militants; all the signs are that Ankara is clearly unable to deal with minority rights in a mature way. Every time Turkey opens a door to democratisation, it slams another door shut. It makes me wonder whether this can still be called a democratic opening. I should like the Commissioner to give his opinion on this, and to tell us whether he is prepared to work with the Turkish Government to draw up a specific timetable for carrying out a number of crucial reforms in accordance with European standards.
(EL) Mr President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, your statements this evening have given me the impression that you are happy to gloss over the fact that the most recent decision by the Turkish Constitutional Court to put the pro-Kurdish party outside the law was taken a few hours before the decisions by the General Affairs Council and the decision by the summit, which essentially give the green light for Turkey to head straight for Europe, at a time when it is a country which violates human and democratic rights, fails to comply with international law and refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus. Have you not come to the conclusion that, instead of bringing Turkey to its senses, this constant indulgence is making it bolder? It is a fact that the Turkish constitution creates political destabilisation, does not guarantee religious and political freedoms and provides an alibi for interventions by the state.
Much has been achieved in Turkey - my fellow Members have spoken about this here - and that deserves our recognition, but there are still areas which we should examine with particular care. There is the question, which has already been mentioned, of freedom of the press and the question of the freedom of electronic media. The OSCE reports, for example, that Turkey is blocking 3 700 Internet sites. Another important matter is the ability of women to participate in public life. The Turkish constitution bans women in traditional headscarves from entering university, while such scarves are worn by as many as 70% of women. This battle between secularism and democracy is a real challenge in Turkey.
The progress reports on Turkey presented to the European Parliament are the result of the balances between these forces. They have nothing to do with the savage exploitation, repression and persecution suffered by workers in Turkey. Trade unionists are prosecuted and sentenced in sham trials. Political assassinations and violence by the prosecuting authorities continue. Political parties are being abolished purely and simply because they express the wishes of the Kurdish population. Elected representatives are being persecuted and jailed en masse. Turkey continues to deny fundamental rights to Kurds and other minorities. It is illegally occupying 40% of the Republic of Cyprus and scuppering every solution to the problem. It is threatening Greece with casus belli and putting forward territorial claims.
(PL) Madam President, I support membership of the European Union for Turkey, but would like to condemn the decision made in December by the Turkish Constitutional Court to ban the DTP. The decision was justified by the party's alleged links with the terrorist PKK organisation. I know we are living in days when security is paramount; however, citizens' freedoms should not suffer because of this. As we know, the party has been representing Kurdish interests in the Turkish Parliament since 2007. Although it did this in a symbolic way with 20 members, it has, in recent years, been an important testimony to the process of regulating the Kurdish question which has begun in Turkey. The presence of the DTP in parliament did not constitute a danger in any way, but it was one of the conditions necessary for political stability. However, I do not think we should talk about destabilisation, because the conflict with the Kurds is an old one, and at no stage has it really ever shaken Turkey. I did not think this would happen now, and do not suppose it will happen.
(ES) I would also like to elaborate on the contradictory situation in which we find ourselves today, continually supporting the process of Turkey's membership, because we need Turkey in the European Union for many reasons. Today we find ourselves in a contradictory situation, since, only a few weeks ago, the European Parliament was showing support for and satisfaction at the steps achieved with regard to the relationship between Turkey and the Kurdish community and now we find that we are surprised at the ban on the main Kurdish party in Turkey, which, of course, raises serious questions once more.
(PL) Madam President, despite the progress made by Turkey on the road to accession, much is still to be desired as far as the process of democratisation of that country is concerned. In a resolution adopted by the European Parliament last year, concern was expressed over the situation prevailing in Turkey concerning freedom of speech, as well as regret caused by limited progress in the area of freedom of religion. Parliament insisted then, and still insists, that the Turkish Government establish legal frameworks, in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which will allow non-Muslim religious groups and Alevis to function without unnecessary restrictions.
Although Istanbul traditionally has an enlightened, Europe-orientated, educated population, this fact and the doubtless excellent events associated with Istanbul as the Capital of Culture in 2010, are not, unfortunately, representative of the country as a whole. We therefore need to face up to reality. Anyone who prohibits the political parties of minorities for being in violation of the constitution is not in tune with European values. This constant chopping and changing is also incomprehensible, as this will surely not gain us a good reputation or make a good impression on our Turkish partners in dialogue.
While freedom of cult is respected in the Republic of Turkey, there has not been much progress in religious freedom in recent years. The freedom of worship is formally recognised, but in reality, it is restricted, for instance, with respect to the choice of place of worship. I regret that the EU fails to approach this issue thoroughly. In the most recent progress report, extending to one hundred and eighty pages, this problem is mentioned only on two of them. There is no mention there of the strong restrictions on the autonomous administration of religious communities, not only at the administrative and economic level, but also at the pastoral and clerical level.
However, that was not what I wanted to say. As Europeans, we must ask ourselves where we actually want to go. If, as a global player, we want to pass on not only economic - and as a Social Democrat I would like to emphasise this - but also political values, not only in Europe but also beyond European borders out into the world, then for this, ultimately, we need Turkey. It will also give us the opportunity to be firm and clear in our dealings with Turkey, which is exactly what is required. Only then will we succeed in setting a democratisation process in motion in order to succeed in our overall purpose.
Thirdly, a very clear message to Turkey. We must be very clear with Turkey. This has been advocated, not just by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, the author of this motion for a resolution, which seems to me a very broad, very thorough, detailed proposal, an excellent basis to work on, I think, but by many of the participants here this evening: Mrs Corazza, Mrs Ludford, Mrs Keller, Mr Zahradil, many others have advocated sending a clear message to Turkey.
In matters of justice, in matters of equality between men and women, the matter of torture and mistreatment, freedom of expression, respect for minorities and pluralism, all these are elements to be borne in mind. In all of those, it has been shown here that we can see undoubted advances and in all of them, we also see inadequacies or even backward steps. That outlines the situation. It depends on how you see it. The glass can be half full or half empty. I think, therefore, that those are the fundamental elements to focus on in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey.
I think that the process of moving towards the rapprochement of Turkey and the European Union is possible; it is a feasible process. For this reason, that process is open and Turkey has the status of a candidate country. It is a necessary process which must, naturally, progress as fast as possible. The role of the European Parliament in that process is absolutely vital. It must play an essential role in the development, analysis, evaluation and consolidation of that process which we all want to see move as quickly as possible.
The first and foremost of them concerns citizens' rights and fundamental freedoms. Turkey's record on freedom of expression is not in line with EU standards. Many authors and journalists are still facing prosecution and conviction for their work. It is now high time for Turkey to adopt the necessary legal reforms so that this problem will belong to Turkey's past and not to its future. That is fundamental for any open and democratic society and it is fundamental also to further discuss such sensitive issues as the Armenian issue, the Kurdish question or the Cyprus problem.
To sum up, Turkey's EU accession process can be a long and sometimes winding road, but it is essential not to lose sight of the basic goal of the democratic transformation of the country. That is in the fundamental interests not only of Turkey but also of the European Union, and that is best achieved by being both fair and firm with Turkey at the same time, which maintains our credibility and the power of conditionality in driving reforms for fundamental freedoms in Turkey. In this major effort, I continue to count on your strong support. That is essential for this project to succeed in the end.
Madam President, the development report on Turkey drafted by the European Commission in 2009 identifies the implementation of constitutional reform as an important challenge in continuing the democratisation process. The report notes that, in spite of the people's clear support for the government and the large parliamentary majority, the advances made up to this point in implementing political and constitutional reform have not been sufficient, because the parties have not been able to find a common language. As in any other democratic country, the positions taken by the Turkish parties reflect the wishes of the electorate. It must not be forgotten that in a democratic society, the parties are, above all, accountable to their electorate, and in Turkey, the European Union must turn its attention to developments at grassroot level. We must be very cautious in merely taking a didactic approach in guiding Turkey's democratisation process. The successful implementation of the desired reforms requires the support of the public, for which a greater universal level of awareness is necessary, as well as a conception of the importance of and the reasons for the reforms. The top-down reforms that have been implemented will not lead to the desired result as long as there exists a feeling that they present a danger to Turkey's internal stability. The pressure on Turkey's government to accelerate reforms for which there is a lack of public support could, though unintentionally, lead to the flourishing of separatism or religious hostility. I hope that the Council and the Commission, together with the Turkish Government, make efforts towards implementing measures which allow the population of Turkey to be involved in the democratisation process considerably more than has been the case so far, in order to ensure that there is fertile ground for implementing the reforms necessary for accession on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria.
Pre-accession negotiations with a candidate country should be aimed at the given country's accession to the European Union. But in the case of Turkey the situation is much more complex. Pre-accession talks have been open since 3 October 2005. In addition to the country's accession itself, the talks should contribute to the promotion of democracy and freedom, and the preservation of civic and human rights in Turkey. Instead of issuing political declarations, this particular goal should be achieved through legislative changes as part of harmonisation with the legal system of the European Union but, first and foremost, through political and social practice stemming from the example set by the Member States. Arguments against accession based on the pattern 'European countries' versus 'Islamic countries' are incorrect and wrong. Turkey's historic affiliation with Europe is undeniable. As a matter of fact, Turkey is today a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. There is no religious yardstick to evaluate a candidate country; on the contrary, freedom of confession is one of Europe's principal values. That is why the sole and decisive criteria for Turkey's accession to the European Union must be its compliance with the principles of the rule of law, legislative confirmation of civil and minority rights, and respect for all the Member States of the European Union.
It is good that the European Parliament is at least addressing the issue of the democratisation of Turkey. The Commission and the Council tend, in principle, to talk up the situation - as dramatic as it might be. They call it 'soft power'. However, where has this 'soft power' got us? It is quite clear that, since opening the accession negotiations, there have been considerably more backward steps than steps in the right direction in Turkey. Now there is yet another party ban. However, there is also the continuing massive restriction of civil freedoms, the oppression of religious minorities to the extent of attempting to expel or destroy them through bloodshed, curtailing their freedom of information and freedom of the press, attempting to annihilate the opposition press and the free trade unions, and the list goes on. 'Pacta sunt servanda' - that is always emphasised in connection with Turkey, and rightly so. However, this applies to Turkey, too! With its entry into the accession negotiations, Turkey entered into an agreement with the EU to comply with the Copenhagen criteria. If it continues to refuse to do so, it will have to ask itself whether it really wants to become part of Europe. The 'softies' in the Commission, the Council Presidency and the Council ought finally to act in a consistent manner instead of continually opening new negotiation chapters.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre on 23 November of last year in the Province of Maguindanao in the Philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism. Fifty seven people were killed, women were raped, people were injured - they convey a bloody message. As a journalist, it struck me, in particular, that there were 30 journalists among those killed. According to the renowned International Crisis Group, in no other case on record have more journalists ever been murdered at one time. For this reason, it is appropriate for the European Parliament to make a clear statement, as we are doing today in this draft resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last November, I had the opportunity to welcome Mrs Edita Burgos, the mother of Jonas Burgos, to the European Parliament. This young Filipino was abducted by armed men in a very busy shopping centre in Manila on 28 April 2007. Since that day, neither his family nor his loved ones have had any news of him. Jonas Burgos is one of hundreds of people who have disappeared or been killed in the Philippines. Murders are committed with total impunity, and the perpetrators are very rarely brought to justice.
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (LT) If a Central European citizen were asked what is happening in the Philippines, he probably would not be able to answer and would say that there is nothing about it on television, so things are probably calm there. However, political murders, clan warfare, people being buried alive, chainsaw massacres, a state of war - this is everyday life in the Philippines. Quite recently, 57 people were murdered, half of them journalists. That is the biggest ever death toll among journalists in the world. We call on the government, we demand that it immediately stop such occurrences, disband the private militias and finally put an end to impunity. This is particularly important during the upcoming elections.
(PL) Mr President, presidential and local government elections are planned in the Philippines for 10 May. Now is the time to do everything to ensure they are fair elections. First of all, it is necessary to establish who was responsible for the murder, in November, of 57 journalists, family members and co-workers of Ismael Mangudadatu, a candidate for governor in the province of Mindanao. So far, local law enforcement agencies have not shown any determination in finding the perpetrators of this massacre. So many mistakes have been made in the investigation that it almost authorises the use of force in politics. The Philippine Government must, at last, face up to the people from the criminal world who have used the opportunity of recent election campaigns to make so many politically-motivated kidnappings and have now murdered over 100 candidates.
(PL) Mr President, defence of human rights is the trademark of the European Union. I greatly regret that this trademark is not important to the Spanish Presidency, and that there are no representatives of the Council here at the moment. This is a very disturbing and downright scandalous situation. We are talking about human rights, we want to defend them, but there is no one here from the Council, and no representatives of the country which is leading the European Union for the next six months. This is, truly, an absolutely unacceptable situation.
In agreement with the government, we have launched an 'EU-Philippines Justice Assistance Mission'. This is a very timely action aimed at capacity-building for the Philippines judicial authorities, including police and military personnel, to help them investigate cases of extrajudicial killings and to prosecute those guilty of murder. We shall also put in place a monitoring system to develop confidence. EPJUST has an initial duration of 18 months and is funded under the Instrument for Stability, but can be extended. Furthermore, we have ongoing projects at local level to promote respect for human rights. These include monitoring of the implementation of international commitments, actions to support the ratification of the Rome Statute of the ICC and voter education.
It is with great sadness that I have to inform you of the tragic death of Mrs Juarez Boal, deputy head of the European Union Delegation to Haiti. Mrs Juarez Boal formerly worked in the European Parliament, until 2002. She died in the tragic earthquake which struck Haiti on 12 January. The total number of victims of the earthquake may be as high as 200 000 people. You will recall that, during the last session a month ago, we observed a one-minute silence in memory of all those who died in the earthquake. We did not then know, we were not sure, that among them was a person so closely associated with the European Parliament and the work of the European Union - Mrs Juarez Boal.
Yesterday, the second round of presidential elections was held in Ukraine. While waiting for official confirmation of the results of the vote, I would like to congratulate the people of Ukraine for conducting free and transparent elections. This is what the reports from Ukraine are saying. I still have not had an official communication, but the statements of our fellow Members of the European Parliament who observed the elections say that apart from a certain number of complaints and what were, certainly, breaches of electoral rules, the absolute majority of the actions of everyone associated with the elections were in accordance with procedure and met the standards of democratic elections. This is a very great achievement for Ukraine. We recall that, five years ago, it was completely different. Today, our wish for Ukraine is that a democratically and peacefully elected President will act for the good of the country. We also want to establish the best possible relations with Ukraine. Despite the high degree of political instability in recent years, it can be seen that democracy in Ukraine has solid foundations.
I would also like to take this opportunity to call upon all political forces in Ukraine to overcome their differences and begin to work together on social and economic reforms, as well as on judicial and constitutional reforms, and to continue their European agenda. I will say this again: the European Union is very anxious to have good, friendly relations with Ukraine. This concerns both the future government and the opposition. We hope and expect that Ukraine will work together on this. We share this challenge and the responsibility. On Wednesday, a debate will be held on the situation in Ukraine following the elections. We will listen to the reports of our fellow Members. The chair of the European Parliament election observation mission was Paweł Kowal. They were on the ground and observed Sunday's voting, and will share information about this with us.
On Wednesday, we will hold another important debate on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data to the United States for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme. I will preside over this debate myself. The European Parliament attaches exceptional importance to ensuring the right level of personal data protection. We were elected directly by our citizens and we have a responsibility to them, but on the other hand, we understand the importance of the SWIFT agreement. These priorities should be taken into account by all Members of this House when making this important and responsible decision. The vote will take place on Thursday. I will not be able to be present during the vote, because I will be attending the European Council in Brussels.
Secondly, we also want to talk to the Commission, but we want to discuss this with the members of the Commission who will bear responsibility for this issue in the future. Since the new Commission has not yet taken office, we should ask the President of the Commission to attend such a discussion himself or to send somebody who will have a post in the new Commission, such as Mr Almunia or Mr Rehn. In this difficult and important debate, it would be sensible to have an interlocutor who will subsequently discharge the same responsibility in the Commission.
Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years. Up until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for the events surrounding this murder and the evidence has never really been properly investigated. In any case, the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know. Although, in this trial, the death sentence could have been commuted to lifelong imprisonment, the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January. The life of Mr Abu-Jamal is now more at risk than ever. We would like this matter to be debated in plenary so that we can decide what action to take in order to ensure that his death sentence is suspended and that Mumia Abu-Jamal is given the opportunity to prove his innocence in a fair trial.
It is very difficult to tell you that one is better than the other. I think that we can save Madagascar. Mr President, you can make representations once again to the United States to request the suspension of the death penalty. This will not be the first time and, unfortunately, I fear that it will not be the last. In any case, on behalf of my group, I refuse to withdraw the resolution that we have prepared on the subject of Madagascar, where there is also a real danger for an entire population.
I would like to warmly congratulate the newly elected College of Commissioners and President Barroso: congratulations to all of you. There is a huge amount of work ahead of us, and the expectations of our citizens are high; it is a time for action and delivery. I will immediately inform the rotating Presidency of the Council and the President of the European Council of the result of our votes and the appointment of the European Commission until 31 October 2014. Thank you very much, and congratulations once again.
The Commission and the European Parliament are going to play an essential role in all of these things, and we as the Council want the Commission to work hard. It certainly has many powers, which are not unlimited, as has been said here, but it does, of course, have the power to do what it needs to do. We want the Commission to work quickly and wisely, because this is what the European public wants. Following the period of institutional uncertainty that Europe has experienced, they also want us all to get to work in order to make up for lost time and immediately launch this new political phase, this new situation in Europe, the definitive Europe of the 21st century.
In the European Union, we have a democratic European Parliament, and this is democracy. In the European Union, we have a European Commission elected by you as the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe, and this is democracy. We believe that, now, with the democratic legitimacy which was given to us by you, by the designation of the democratic governments of all of our 27 Member States, we are proud and confident in working with full determination for the good of democracy in Europe, a Europe which is, in fact, a beacon of freedom in the world.
Europe was born of an international crisis and, for the first time in 60 years, it is facing a new international crisis that is of a different type but that is undoubtedly serious and dangerous. It is overcoming it, although we are not yet out of the woods. The euro has done its job as a monetary shield; there will never be enough words to say how much we owe it: the automatic stabilisers, those famous solidarity mechanisms, which are too ... You have benefited a great deal from them, my friends!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has not made its decision lightly. We voted on the President of the Commission five months ago in this House and although we did not give him our support then, he received the majority vote. On the basis of this majority, which regrettably rested on people who are actually not in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, he has presented a College to us and today we are to assess this College.
It is also necessary for us to assess this College. There are two options open to us: we can go and divide this House into those on the Right and those on the Left. These two groups have conflicting ideologies and must vote accordingly. That is one option. However, this is not the way that Europe works. We do not have a majority in this Parliament. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) does not have a majority in this Parliament either, nor has the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Europe is not an entity in which any political force whatsoever can alone cobble together a majority and say that Europe will now be governed in a particular way. Europe is a permanent compromise. That is what sometimes makes it so cumbersome and also so difficult to understand. However, better a permanent compromise, which leads to successes and more social justice, than an ideological battle that ultimately fizzles out without any tangible results.
It is therefore very difficult for us to weigh up the benefits. Of course, we all enjoy a tussle. I, too, enjoy arguing principles with fellow Members from other groups, but Europe also needs tangible results. We therefore asked ourselves what we, as Social Democrats - as Socialists and Democrats - can call for and get accepted. We then defined criteria. One criterion was that we wanted the political force that is the second-strongest force in Europe to be represented on a higher level in this Commission. We therefore wanted the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and we succeeded in getting this post in place.
We asked whether we could introduce a social impact assessment into European Union legislation as a regulatory mechanism. For us, the question was whether measures - such as the Services Directive in the past - could still be set in motion at all. No, we wanted a mechanism for examining any measures that this Commission is to take in terms of their impact on the social security systems of the Member States before they are taken. This was incorporated. We wanted - and, for me, this is a quantum leap in European policy - the legislative resolutions of this Parliament to be turned into the Commission's own legislative initiatives within a year. That is a huge step forward, because it means that the right of initiative of this Parliament, which unfortunately does not exist, will be secured by indirect means. We see this as significant progress.
Ultimately, as the second-strongest force in this Parliament and also as a group without which no qualified majority would be possible in this House, we wanted to be represented in the Commission. Three of the seven vice-presidents are Social Democrats. In this respect, you have largely accommodated us. In recent weeks and months, we have voiced many concerns, including in our debate this morning. In weighing up these concerns against the progress made, we decided to offer you our support for the next five years. When I say 'you', I mean the College of Commissioners. You can count on our support if you take seriously what I say to you: Europe will either be a social Europe or it will fail. It is our joint responsibility to ensure that it becomes a more social Europe. The S&D Group will support this Commission.
The basic assumption behind this new bold approach is the recognition that in fact, in the multipolar world of tomorrow, Europe cannot play a significant role without being more effective and without further deepening its own integration in the near future. We expect you to embrace this assumption and to come forward with clear, firm and ambitious proposals and reforms in all these fields. We expect that, to achieve this, the Commission will use the right of initiative to its full potential. I am clearly talking about the Commission as a whole, working as a college, as a cohesive political body pushing European integration forward. A strong Commission may be helpful, but a strong Commission in that respect is indispensable.
The Lisbon Treaty offers new tools and has enhanced our capacity for action. High Representative Ashton, we ask you to use these new tools. We expect more from a High Representative than we have seen until now. Your role demands it and the European Union requires it. Take the opportunities. The lesson we learned from Haiti is an example. Put the report to establish a European civil protection force on the Council table immediately. Having said that, my group will support this Commission, with its strong liberal presence, and we are prepared to offer our commitment to advance the European cause with her.
Mr Barroso, do not play the game of saying that those who fail to vote for the Commission are against Europe. Not with us, the European Greens. You can play that game with others, but not with us. We propose to cooperate unconditionally with you if you wish to make progress on a European tax system. If you wish Europe to have its own resources, we will support you against the Member States' defence of their economic sovereignty. I will name them: whether it be Germany, or France, we will support you.
If you wish to be the guardians of the treaties - there are, for example, negotiations taking place today within the Council aimed at returning the refugees to Libya, and we ask the Council to tell us what the legal basis of those negotiations is. Will Parliament be part of the ordinary legislative procedure? The Council tells us: 'you will be told that at the end of the negotiations'. That is impossible; it is the Commission's responsibility to intervene to ensure that the European institutions are informed of the legal basis of those negotiations.
I can give you a whole host of examples. If you want to make progress on climate change, if you want Europe to go further than the three times twenty, if you want to get closer to 30%, you will have the support of the entire Verts/ALE Group. If you want to go further in the field of financial regulation after the financial crisis, you will have our full support. If you and your Commission want to go further with regard to the protection of Europe, you will have our support. If you want to solve the Cyprus problem, you will have our support. If you want to see an end, finally, to this crazy situation in which a country such as Greece - as I said earlier - spends 4.3% of its GDP on defence, you will have our support. You will have it unconditionally!
In Mr Barroso, we have the right leader to take the Commission forward. In his political guidelines, he outlines an ambitious agenda to focus on the issues that matter, an agenda which, in general, we support. Every single Member State should have backed his efforts by sending the strongest possible nominee as Commissioner, and in some cases, he has been badly let down. Of course he must back every member of his team - we would expect nothing less from a leader in his position - and, in organising his team, although we question some portfolios, he has probably done his best with what he has got.
However, we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge. In this regard, all of our questions related primarily to political projects. In what direction should the European integration process go? Which measures are most important to the Commission candidate? There were far too many vague answers to these questions and answers that, politically speaking, we do not support. Despite claims of a more social Europe, they persisted in advocating a route towards deregulation, privatisation or the flexicurity concept. The flexibility of workers was the top priority and social security was right at the bottom.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, in generations to come, children will be told a story. They will be told that once upon a time, Europe was divided; there was a big wall down the middle of it and the people in the East were very poor and they had no democracy, and they lived under an evil system called Communism that killed millions of its own people. But, joy of joys, the wall came down and we finished up with 27 nations, and those people lived in democracy and 500 million people lived in peace...
The politicians in charge became very greedy; they wanted money for themselves and they wanted power. So they resorted to lies and deceit, they staged the most spectacular bureaucratic coup d'état that the world had ever seen. But they did not need to use any bullets to do it. They were much cleverer, much more scheming than that. What they did is they put in place a new treaty - it was called the Lisbon Treaty. Then they gave 27 people total unlimited power. These would have been the people who made all the laws. Of course, they already had a flag, and they already had an anthem, but they went about building a new state. But they ignored the people. What they did, whether they knew it or not, was to recreate the very evil system that the people in Eastern Europe had lived under before. But the incredible thing was that many of the new bosses had also worked for that same evil system before. Well, of course, the plan was flawed and their fanciful monetary scheme collapsed. But, still, the new bosses would not listen to the people. No, they made life tougher and tougher: they put tens of millions into poverty; they denied people a say and, in the end, those people had to resort to violence to get back their nation states and their democracies.
(DE) Mr President, after the fairytale that you have just heard, I would like to return to reality. My son is seventeen years old and is studying English very intensively, because he knows that English is the working language, and he hopes that it will help him to get an appropriate job. He is an enthusiastic European, but is dissatisfied with European politics - and rightly so. In Germany, the magazine Der Spiegel is already writing about widespread political contempt - and rightly so. Nevertheless, millions of young Europeans want a functional, competent and bold democracy in the 21st century. Yet, what are we being offered here today by the Commission? Are these the competent people - and the best people - that we need?
Those of us up here in the back row represent an independent group of citizens who have played a key role in ensuring that the right-wing radicals in this House do not set up a group once again. We are passionate pro-Europeans, but this is precisely why we are extremely disappointed by the people that you have presented us with and by the quality of these people. Would we employ an assistant here who becomes a laughing stock like Günther Oettinger has done on YouTube in 'Oettinger talking English'? Presumably not. From the point of view of competence, would we want to deal with an Austrian Commissioner who has not proven himself at all in his area.
Mr Barroso, there are very many experienced parliamentarians here in Parliament that you could adorn yourself with. You have one of them, for example, in the shape of the Swede, that is true. Yet, why do you not want Mr Karas? Why have you not taken a German from here, instead of the ones you have? Because you are not allowed to. Because, despite the Treaty of Lisbon, we are still restrained, because we are still not so independent that we can make sovereign decisions - you cannot and neither can we as Parliament.
I would like to tell Mr Schulz that he is mistaken, and I have at his disposal, and at the disposal of the entire European Parliament Committee on immunities, the momentous decision of the French supreme court, the Court of Cassation, which overturned all the sentences handed down to me and which, in its exceptional judgment, declared that I had been prosecuted on the basis of parts of sentences artificially put together to form a statement and that, furthermore, though cobbled together in this way by my political opponents, this statement did not come within the provisions of the law. This is an exceptionally rare decision, since the Court overturned a lower court ruling and decided the case itself, which happens very rarely with the French Court of Cassation. This overturning of a ruling and judgment of a case by the Court of Cassation became part of our legal history for the first time during the Dreyfus affair. Therefore, Mr Gollnisch is as innocent as Mr Dreyfus.
It is true that the timescale that was planned for closing it - one year - has now passed. It is true, however, that there are difficulties, and we can give some examples, such as former prisoners in Yemen not being able to return there immediately. We are also finding that this issue is very controversial in the United States, although we welcome the fact that President Obama is persevering with his intention to close Guantánamo despite the strong opposition that he is facing in Congress, not only among the Republicans but also among the Democrats.
We have therefore always been clear about our position in our contacts with the United States as well as recently, in the visit to Brussels by the United States' special envoy on this issue, Daniel Fried, who was formerly responsible for relations between the United States and the European Union and who is now responsible for managing the closure of Guantánamo. During his visit to Brussels, and in the context of the human rights dialogue that the European Union regularly holds with the United States, concern was expressed by the European Union about the use of the so-called military commissions and prolonged detention without trial, and naturally, we expressed our opposition to the death penalty. These are very clear, firm positions that the European Union has maintained, is maintaining and will continue to maintain in its relations with the United States.
I believe that the European Union has fulfilled its agreement with the United States, an agreement that was set out in the joint declaration that I mentioned earlier. There are Member States that have already agreed to receive people who have been or are prisoners in Guantánamo, and the number that we can handle at the moment, among the European countries who have quantified the number of prisoners, along with Switzerland, which is a partner of the European Union in the Schengen area, is around 16.
In any case, you will also be aware that the decision as to whether or not to accept a prisoner from Guantánamo is naturally up to the Member States. The mechanism agreed by the Home Affairs Ministers of the European Union was the realisation of this desire to help the United States. We have always said that we wanted the Guantánamo prison to be closed, as it was clearly contrary to the most fundamental human rights. The European Union therefore needs to help to make this possible, as far as we can and in accordance with the decisions taken - I repeat - by each Member State individually and sovereignly regarding the possibility of receiving these prisoners. We can say that there were 242 prisoners in the detention centre when President Obama came to power, and that 44 of them have left the prison.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the European Union, including the European Commission, has consistently called for the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention facility. As already mentioned by the Minister, the European Union established a two-tier framework to support the closure of Guantánamo, firstly through the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusion of 4 June 2009 and the annexed information exchange mechanism and, secondly, through the Joint Statement of the European Union and its Member States and the United States of America on the Closure of the Guantánamo Bay Detention Facility and Future Counter-Terrorism Cooperation of 15 June 2009.
In the context of the abovementioned statement on the closure of Guantánamo, on 16 June 2009 the President of the Council wrote to the co-chair of the US Detention Policy Task Force. In this letter, the European Union put forward a non-paper with principles of international law relevant to the fight against terrorism. It includes unequivocal statements on due process guarantees, such as access to court to challenge arrest, detention and transfer, as well as on the prohibition of torture. They have been discussed in detail in the dialogue on counter-terrorism and international law.
The Commission considers these guarantees to be important to this dialogue, as they contribute to a better understanding of how the fight against terrorism should respect the rule of law and international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law. As already mentioned, the European Union opposes the death penalty and has intervened in individual cases with third countries, including the United States, to prevent it from being carried out. The Commission will consider appropriate steps in case the death penalty is imposed on a former Guantánamo detainee tried by a US court or military commission. The European Commission appreciates the steps taken so far by President Obama to close Guantánamo and hopes to see further progress on this in the future.
Also, as the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council said, President Obama's personal representative has visited the European Union, met with our President and with several Member States and asked for our cooperation, which has to be offered on the basis of a series of premises mentioned by the Commissioner. One of these is that this is a problem created by the previous government of the United States, and that the European Union has to cooperate, but on the basis of certain requirements, in particular, the security of our Member States.
In this respect, I would like to recall the decision made by some Member States, including the one that currently holds the Presidency of the Council, my own country. I would like to ask the representative of the Spanish Presidency if he is thinking of taking any additional measures to try to harmonise the response of the Member States to the problems that have arisen in Yemen in particular, or whether he is intending to leave this decision to the individual and sovereign context of each Member State, as decided by the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs.
One final question, Madam President: it is indeed true that 100 out of the 190 or so prisoners that remain have been sent to their countries of origin or to third countries, and that 40 are going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts. There are, however, still 50 that are not going to be released because there is not sufficient proof to take them into custody but the risk that they actually pose has forced the United States Government to decide that they should not be released. I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what they think about the situation of these 50 people who are not going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts.
It is shocking that large countries that were accomplices of Bush in the extraordinary renditions, in the secret prisons and in Guantánamo, such as Germany, the UK, Italy, Poland and Romania, should shirk their responsibilities by ignoring the appeals of the Obama Administration. This is a topic for the common foreign and security policy, which should be dealt with by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, in view of Article 24 of the Treaty of Lisbon, and it must be based on mutual political solidarity among the Member States.
My own constituent, Shaker Aamer, a legal UK resident whose family of a British wife and four British children live in Battersea in London, is still, after eight years, marooned in legal limbo in Guantánamo. He appears to be the victim of pass-the-parcel, whereby the US and UK governments may be colluding to bundle him off to his home country Saudi Arabia. He is a direct witness to his own and others' torture, not only by the US but by UK secret agents. This would be very convenient in preventing his testimony before UK courts.
Madam President, in reference to the statement of my respected fellow Member who spoke before me, I would like to stress that, in fact, there is no firm evidence and there are no specific facts concerning the existence of CIA detention centres and prisons in some European countries, at least, not in Poland. Once again, in the course of the last few years, we are talking about Guantánamo in the European Parliament. I would like to point out that we have also talked about this during Barack Obama's Presidency, and so it seems this problem is not something we can attribute exclusively to the dreadful and evil administration of George Bush junior. It appears this is something more complicated. I say this because the representative of the Council and the Spanish Presidency said that, in fact, the Americans still have not done everything they promised.
In reality, it is a transatlantic cooperation problem. Almost 800 people from over forty countries have been detained there in disregard of the Geneva Convention - without charge, without a lawyer and without a trial. There are numerous reports of the murder and of the most dreadful abuse and humiliation of the detainees. The fact that most Member States of the European Union have, up to now, shied away from declaring their willingness as third countries to receive detainees from Guantánamo Bay is, is, in my opinion, a disgrace and quite deplorable, and I call on the Commission to immediately bring this issue before the Council once again, including the subject of the discovery of the part played by European countries in the illegal detention of prisoners there.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I come from the West Midlands, the home of the so-called 'Tipton Taliban', who were detained at Guantánamo. As a UKIP MEP, I must agree that seizure and deportation of people from one country to be tried in another, without judicial oversight, and to face foreign imprisonment, is an alien process. It is an affront to liberty, democracy, accountability and natural human rights.
(DE) Madam President, the closure of Guantánamo is surely a sign that the US has to concede that it has violated human rights, including for the purpose of the fight against terrorism, and that it wants to put an end to it. I therefore welcome this step. Slovakia, Italy and other Member States have declared their willingness to accept detainees. In my opinion, that needs to be discussed at European level, as former prisoners could end up in any Member State as a result of the Schengen Agreement. In essence, however, we first need to clarify three points.
President Obama was entirely correct when he declared that it was essential to close Guantánamo in order to give back to the United States of America the moral authority which it lost by the use of extra-judicial instruments in the fight against terrorism. President Obama made the decision on his first day in the White House to suspend the trials before military tribunals and to announce the closure of the Guantánamo base. His task has not been easy, especially in view of the lack of cooperation on the part of the US Congress.
In this European Parliament, we have always been divided with respect to the transatlantic strategy, but we obtained a broad consensus against the prison of shame. In the Council, deeply divided by the issue of the Iraq war, it was possible for all the Ministers for Foreign Affairs to be unanimous in demanding the closure of Guantánamo. As Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra has already said, several Member States have agreed to receive ex-prisoners into their territories: France, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, the UK, Italy and Hungary. The decision whether or not to receive prisoners from Guantánamo is a decision exclusively for each of the Member States, but it should be taken on the basis of European coordination. In a Europe without borders and with freedom of movement, information needs to be shared among the Member States.
(SL) First of all, I should like to thank the representatives of both the Council and the Commission for their proactive stance on Guantánamo. Guantánamo has been an anomaly and a disgrace since day one, since the day this prison opened. Its opening could perhaps be more easily understood in the wake of the shocking attacks of 11 September, but years have passed since. Yet, the disgrace of Guantánamo continues and, in fact, all of us who believe in the values of Western civilisation, such as respect for human rights and the rule of law, continue to feel ashamed of it.
Everyone knows, however, that the closure of Guantánamo will not stop questions being asked about human rights and counterterrorism, either in the United States or in Europe. In the United States, as you said, the antiterrorism law still permits unlimited pre-trial detention and trials before military courts. In Europe, well, the Guantánamo prisoners did not just fall out of the sky. I genuinely believe that there has been a failure to shed light on this subject.
(FR) Madam President, first of all, we learnt very recently that the Guantánamo detention centre will close not in 2010, as scheduled, but in 2013 - in other words, at the end of President Obama's term of office. Although that closure is taking longer than planned, we can still be glad that it is under way, because it could have also been stopped. It is a response to a wish expressed by Europe. Indeed, we cannot, on the one hand, criticise the United States for years about the Guantánamo centre and, on the other, fail to show much will or ambition on our side in order to help it solve this problem.
A short time ago, I met the Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, who explained the scale of the task to me, but who also made me aware of the desire and the will of the United States to benefit from the European Member States' support. This support would entail helping it to close that detention centre by accommodating some of the detainees in Europe. We must therefore help the United States, as part of a coordinated effort, to turn the page on an institution that we Europeans have been opposing for many years.
(SK) Why should the European Union have to put up with the consequences of American policies? It would be simpler to call for America and its President, who is fulfilling his pre-election promise - in which many leading politicians publicly support him, by the way - to sort out this large and unwelcome problem itself. However, the European Union has much in common with this. Terrorists have also threatened and attacked the EU and continue to threaten the entire world, of which the EU is an integral part. Have we already forgotten the London underground, Germany, Holland, Spain and the dozens of foiled terrorist attempts? We are therefore in this together with America. It affects all of us.
It is commonly accepted that Guantánamo was a mistake on the part of the United States of America in their endeavour to fight terrorism. However, we must ensure that similar errors are not repeated in future, especially not in Europe. Unfortunately, however, the report to be tabled shortly before the UN Human Rights Council, in March 2010, raises serious suspicions about the practice of the secret detention of suspects in the Member States of the European Union such as Great Britain, Romania and Poland.
(PL) Madam President, I would like to start with what the previous speaker said here. For you said most categorically, Mr Papanikolaou, that illegal prisons existed in Europe, including in Poland and Rumania. Speaking as a Pole, I want to state clearly that there is no firm evidence that such prisons existed in Poland. That is my first comment. Now my second comment: I do not think there is any dispute among us, in this Chamber, about whether Guantánamo should cease to exist. However, it is very easy to see that closing down Guantánamo is going to be a very complicated process, and that no one wants to help with this. We have to ask what can be done about this. Well, I would like to ask the following question: have any changes been made in terms of the techniques used to house and interrogate prisoners? For many methods have been used there - from submerging prisoners' heads in water to depriving them of sleep for many nights. Are we certain these inhumane techniques are now no longer used there?
(HU) I am pleased that my fellow Members are so outraged about the heavy-handed infringements of human rights taking place in Guantánamo in the name of combating terrorism. I can take this outrage seriously, however, only if you finally make a commitment, in response to my numerous statements to this effect, to examine the matter of the Guantánamo that exists right here within the EU, in Hungary. I repeat, for the umpteenth time, that in Hungary, there are twelve individuals belonging to the political opposition who have been in pre-trial detention for nearly a year on charges of terrorism, and who are kept in the same conditions and whose criminal procedural rights are being infringed just as much as those of the prisoners at Guantánamo. I would ask that my fellow Members kindly indicate with a show of hands who among you is willing to take this case seriously and take part in a detailed investigation. I am waiting for the show of hands by Madam President and my fellow Members.
The first matter is Yemen. With regard to Yemen, I do not have any evidence that a specific decision has been made or is to be made connecting Yemen with prisoners that come from there and are in Guantánamo. The situation in Yemen was the subject of conclusions of the first Foreign Affairs Council meeting in the history of the Union. There has only been one ordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting, on 25 January, and there was a conclusion inviting Yemen to conduct a programme of major political reforms, but no reference was made to the issue of Guantánamo. We do, of course, support these conclusions, as well as the conference that was held in London on 27 January.
I believe that there is a general agreement that the Guantánamo prison constitutes a series of serious human rights violations and legal aberrations that cannot be tolerated, that we do not want repeated, and that the European Union has severely criticised. It is for this very reason that we want to work with the President of the United States, who decided to put an end to Guantánamo and to close the prison. Not only this, but he also decided that there would be a review of United States prison policy.
There are therefore strong grounds for Mr Vajgl's comments about the intrinsic need to close this prison due to massive human rights violations, and for other comments that have been made. Moreover, I believe, in any case, that the fact that human rights violations take place in other countries of the world or in Europe does not mean that this situation should not be criticised or that we should not work to ensure that it does not happen again. I am saying this in relation to the speech by Mr Nattrass, because I am of course sure that he agrees that there is nothing in Europe similar to the Guantánamo prison.
The European Union and the United States have worked very thoroughly on this issue. I have mentioned the declaration made on 15 June last year in which the United States and the European Union committed to working for the consolidation of human rights and the fight against terrorism. This concerns the human rights violated in the Guantánamo prison, but also the need for the fight against terrorism to be conducted with absolute respect for freedoms, fundamental rights and legality. It is important for us to be in line with this. I therefore completely agree with what Mr Coelho said about the importance of the European Union contributing to this.
However, we are not only talking about the decision by the United States to close Guantánamo, with all the problems that brings, which I discussed in my first speech. It also has to be recognised that President Obama is genuinely breaking with the past. This means turning over a new leaf, not only with Guantánamo, but with all of the practices that have surrounded it. I think that this is very clear when we look at the measures that President Obama has adopted.
He has put an end to the secret detentions by the CIA, and has ordered that from now on, all United States prisoners be registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross. He has put an end to the 'enhanced' interrogation techniques, also by the CIA. This means that US investigators can no longer use legal opinions on torture and interrogation techniques that arose after 11 September as justification, which of course means turning over a new leaf. There has also been a re-examination of transfer policy to ensure that it is in line with international law.
I believe that this is something that needs to be pointed out. In order to achieve it, we do, of course, need to cooperate, and Mrs Muñiz de Urquiza referred to this very explicitly: to cooperating with the United States. Europe has criticised the prison on many occasions, and Europe needs to cooperate as far as possible, although there are two types of limitation. There is one that affects the United States, which is that ultimately, it is United States legislation and United States sovereignty that is being applied. The other is that the Member States of the European Union also sovereignly decide whether to accept prisoners from Guantánamo.
We need to cooperate among ourselves on this, we need to have dialogue among ourselves, and part of this dialogue needs to go even further than the specific subject of Guantánamo. This matter has been mentioned in some of the speeches, for example, by Mrs Hautala and Mr Czarnecki: the subject of victims. I think that this is one of the areas of dialogue that we should implement in our relations with the United States. I think that this dialogue regarding the victims of the various terrorist crimes is a matter that needs to be dealt with in the future, but in any case, there is an in-depth dialogue ongoing with the United States on this issue.
I would like to finish by saying that the European Union has a very clear position regarding the issue of Guantánamo in favour of the closure of the prison. The European Union has a very clear position that human rights and fundamental freedoms should not be violated on any grounds, and, of course, in favour of the fight against terrorism and the need to work together with the United States. This is a credible position, given that there has undeniably been a radical change, an obvious radical change from the past, in terms of the counter-terrorism policy of the United States and of President Obama and in terms of a whole series of policies relating to detention, transfer and interrogation. This is the position that we need to strengthen and help to consolidate. The Council's position is therefore one of clear cooperation with the United States in order to achieve what we all want, which is the permanent closure of the Guantánamo prison.
I shall be brief. Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose. However, as it has been worded confusingly, we are withdrawing it. Nevertheless, we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico. Climate protection must not come to a standstill. I would ask for your support.
At the same time, essential sectoral reforms in areas such as energy - in particular the gas sector - transport and the environment need to be undertaken and implemented. We have also consistently encouraged Ukraine to revisit constitutional reform, to bring stability and put in place functioning ground rules for political life. A constitution needs to stand the test of time, and its reform should not be tied to short-term political considerations. It is up to Ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt. However, it should ensure that an effective system of checks and balances is in place which avoids the political paralysis that Ukraine has experienced in the past. The help and advice of the Venice Commission will be important in ensuring that this is done in a manner corresponding to European standards, availing of the best experience available.
It is our task to encourage Ukraine on the way forward and to support Kiev's own leadership in a process of far-reaching reforms and modernisation. We have many tools to do so. Through the European neighbourhood policy, we have the means to support Ukraine's own reform efforts. Already today, ongoing and planned technical and financial cooperation with Ukraine is in the region of EUR 435 million, without counting possible macrofinancial assistance. The Eastern Partnership has brought additional tools. The comprehensive institution-building programme envisaged by the Eastern Partnership is a case in point, as it specifically targets institutions within the Ukrainian Government which need strengthening in order to deliver on reform.
Madam President, Commissioner, we are rather disappointed. I am one of the people who was in the tent city during the Orange Revolution in Kiev and when I look at what has been done over the past five years, I want to say to President Yushchenko that he has not brought stability to his country, he has not created parliamentary opportunities and he has brought the legislative process to a halt. He is certainly responsible for the failure of the Orange Revolution. I hope that these elections will bring new stability to Ukraine. However, despite the elections apparently being conducted in accordance with international standards, I am concerned that this is not a stable, self-confident democracy. When the legislation is amended three days before the second ballot, right in the middle of the elections, for whatever purpose, this does not demonstrate that the process has been understood. Instead, it causes us to watch Ukraine with great concern. I believe that we must become closely involved in the issue of the development of democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine, together with the related subject of stability, which is not a contradiction, but a consequence of this.
Mr Füle, you have a specific responsibility relating to neighbourhood policy. However, neighbourhood policy does not simply mean going on as before. Instead, it means using the tools available to us not only for a bilateral relationship with a country like Ukraine or with other countries in the region, but instead in a multilateral approach to these countries, so that they come closer together and become more stable. We must give them perspectives. This does not involve referring every day to the enlargement of the European Union, but instead making visa facilities available to them now, considering the possibility of a free trade zone and perhaps even offering them the prospect of the same status as Norway within a European economic area. This will not harm anyone, does not represent aggressive behaviour towards anyone and, at the same time, will lead to the introduction of the European perspective and of stability in countries of this kind. I hope that the new government will prove itself worthy of taking part in this type of project.
We must say that the international observers gave a very positive assessment of the elections in Ukraine, regardless of the fact that the legislation surrounding the actual elections stood on shaky ground. It can be said that the fact that changes were made at the last minute did not directly affect the result of these elections. In fact, we can say that democracy in Ukraine was the main winner because, when the current president stands again as a candidate and only receives 5% of the votes, this seems to me to be a very clear sign that democracy is working.
One of the rules of democracy is that you accept the result of the elections as it is. Also, you acknowledge your rival's victory when the assessment of the actual elections is positive. This is why our message to the losing candidate must be very clear: Ukraine needs political stability and must be given the opportunity finally to initiate long-delayed reforms. Apart from these messages, we must clearly state in this House that we will help Ukraine to start moving forward again through our policy, the Neighbourhood Policy, and the Eastern Partnership.
One important issue that we need to deal with is the fact that the people of Ukraine do not really trust any of the heads of the Ukrainian parties to lead their country on behalf of and for the benefit of all its citizens. If there is one result that has come out of the presence of the election observers, alongside the fact that the elections were conducted properly, which goes without saying, it is the discovery during the course of many discussions that most people voted for the lesser evil. None of the citizens whom I met had great expectations of this election. That is alarming in the case of such a young democracy, which has moved further away from the former Soviet system than any other country in Eastern Europe.
The internal failings in Ukraine are mirrored by failings in the European strategy. We must not take this lightly any longer. We must give our unconditional support to Ukraine's focus on the West, because we have a lot to lose. Gas is one subject which always causes a great deal of consternation. I only need to mention Sevastopol, where we are facing a major conflict. We cannot simply let things go on as they have before. You have taken on a significant responsibility in this area.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, of course, Yulia Tymoshenko is entitled to appeal against the result of the presidential election. Given the intrigues and scheming which went on in 2004, we cannot blame her, except for the fact that this time, international election observers have confirmed the results. She can stand up for her supposed rights. However, this is not a clever move in political terms, because a dispute of this kind will result in the political and economic uncertainty in the country continuing.
Madam President, Commissioner, five years ago, this Chamber went through the Orange Revolution, too, in a certain sense. However, several weeks ago, including in Mrs Ashton's speech, questions were asked about whether the Ukrainians were ready for the Orange Revolution, and if they had put it all into practice? I share Mrs Harms' regret, here, that Mrs Ashton is not with us today. There is an answer to this question: a 70% turnout at an election is, truly, a rarity in Europe, and it is a real rarity in our countries, too. In this sense, Mr Brok is not right when he says the Orange Revolution lost. It won, because it was all about having rules from which everyone could benefit. In Poland, too, we know about situations in which the beneficiary of democratic rules was someone who had formerly been opposed to democracy. However, this is good - this is how it should be.
Now the time has come for our answer: have we done everything we should have done following the Orange Revolution? Have we answered that question? Apart from all the instruments which the Commissioner has spoken about - and it is good that we have created these instruments - have we answered that the door is open for Ukraine? Can far-reaching reforms be carried out in a post-communist country without that promise? Can we encourage people to make sacrifices if we tell them they will always be kept waiting outside? Should we not, rather, tell them: there is room for you in Europe, not today, not tomorrow, but there is room.
To say that is a great opportunity for the new Commissioner, Mr Füle. Mrs Ashton has not come, today. Commissioner, be bold and be the first person who starts to say that there is room. Not today, not tomorrow, but there will be room. This will be of great help to the Ukrainians. This may be the last moment when this can be said, and this is why all Ukrainians must be certain that integration, cooperation with Europe and changes to the law are their own personal opportunity.
This must not just be said to the elite, to businesspeople or to students. It must be said in such a way that everyone will understand that it is still worth making sacrifices after the years of communism, that it is still worth doing something. It is an opportunity for you, too, Mr Füle. Say this clearly, and you will go down in history. You will help not only Ukraine, but all of Central Europe, because prosperity and security for Ukraine mean an opportunity for the whole of Central Europe. Everyone must feel that they have an opportunity. This is why, apart from the association agreement, which is very important, we need to relax the visa requirement for Ukrainians and, in the future, lift it. We need to say very clearly: the door to Europe is open for Ukraine. Someone must, at last, after these five years, say it.
(PL) Madam President, there is at least one country of the former Soviet Union where the results of elections are not known in advance. That country is Ukraine, and we should be pleased about this, because we, too, have played our part, here. After the elections in Ukraine, something will change. There will be a new President, and that new President should meet with a friendly reception in the European Union and the European Parliament. This is because Ukraine's European inclinations are not a passing interest, but a serious challenge and the ambition of millions of Ukrainians. A new openness to Ukraine is needed from the European Union. Let us not be motivated by personal ambitions. I do understand that in the European People's Party, there is a little regret that the elections were not won by the woman they wanted to win. However, let us not push the new President of Ukraine into the arms of Moscow. Ukraine is going to be a partner from whom much will be expected. Ukraine is going to be a partner who will be given much to do. Ukraine is going to be a partner who should be treated with goodwill. Therefore, once again, a new European impulse is needed, because Ukraine is part of Europe, and we must implement this policy in our own interest.
In a democracy, it is inconceivable for electoral law to be changed between the two rounds of an election. This does no credit to those who proposed them, those who voted for them or those who made them. It suggests that there are unworthy and undesirable intentions behind it. A lot needs to change with the judicial authorities' lack of independence, as they are subject to too much influence, not only from political powers but also from economic actors. Without a free and independent justice system there can be no law, human rights are not guaranteed, and there is no foreign investment or progress.
However, the blame for this disillusionment can also be laid at the door of this House, and many Member States in particular. I wish that for a few seconds, we could put ourselves in the shoes of a citizen of a European country which, due to the vicissitudes of history, is still not a member of the European Union. What would we expect from the EU? Solidarity. Yet many foreign ministries, with the sole concern of not bothering or upsetting Moscow, have used and abused the permanent infighting in Kiev in order to avoid stating unequivocally that the Ukraine is an independent and sovereign country.
However, we should say something to the European Union. In this situation, if we want to have influence in the post-Soviet space and consolidate the positions of democracy and human rights in this region, then we must work with Ukraine, and more actively than ever before. The European Union must give Ukraine an alternative European vision. To do this, we should first of all aim for so-called 'soft' measures that have a long-term impact, such as promoting economic integration, the more active creation of people-to-people contacts and political dialogue with Ukraine's government institutions.
(HU) In the debate about the current situation in Ukraine, I would like to ask the Commission to use its relations or network of relations with Ukraine to request and show a consistent and clear commitment with regard to the rights of national minorities, alongside other areas, as what we have heard today about recent setbacks in Ukraine, affecting so many areas, applies exponentially to members of minorities, to education in the languages of minorities and to the use of their mother tongue. Clarity and consistency is required on our side because the European Union does have the ability to influence Ukraine, which has a neighbourhood policy status, right across the board, including the rules and regulations regarding national minorities. We have seen that the consistency of our standpoint and messages does work, and we hope that this may help in finding the appropriate remedies for such issues. I propose that any future agreement drafted with Ukraine specifically covers these issues, including the right to mother-tongue education, as this is a fundamental pre-requisite for the survival of national minorities.
(LT) Today, Ukraine is experiencing not just an economic, but in some senses a political crisis. Perhaps these presidential elections will help bring the country out of political stalemate and will provide more stability. Ukraine is still deciding which model of civilisation it should subscribe to. Should the country cooperate with the east or choose integration in Europe? It is not such an easy choice to make, especially when the ideological division that exists in political life has also spread to society. The door to Europe must be left open for Ukraine and transparent elections are an important step strengthening the principles of a democratic state. The people of Ukraine have expressed their will to choose the leader of their country. Ukraine is a European country which must have the right to take decisions on Europe. Therefore, the European Union must cooperate intensively with Ukraine, strengthening democracy in this country and speeding up its integration in the European Union.
This election was closely fought, but it was a democratic one and, for us, that is the news of the day. Basically, the close contest has exposed how complicated this country is. Ukraine is a multi-ethnic and a multi-confessional country and one with a very chequered history, which is something we have to take into account. I think that we, both the European Parliament and Europe as a whole, should use all means to encourage some sort of productive dialogue within Ukraine, a dialogue that would strengthen the Ukrainian state and society from within.
However, I was, of course, disappointed by the result, because President Yanukovich is no Western-style democrat. He will now formally drop all NATO aspirations and pay only lip-service to EU membership for his country which, of course, is now also formally opposed by Russia, his close friend and neighbour. He will content himself, instead, with an FTA and a visa liberalisation regime. Mrs Tymoshenko is clutching at straws, in my view, by challenging the result of her narrow defeat in the courts and I doubt very much this will succeed.
The one real concern I have now is what I heard being discussed on the night: renewed splittist tendencies to break off the Ukrainian west - opposed to Yanukovich and supporters of Tymoshenko - to either join Poland or form a new western state. It probably will not happen but, if it does, it must be peaceful and by consensus. What we must do here in the European Union is to support the legacy of the Orange Revolution and our common shared democratic values with Ukraine.
(DE) Madam President, the battle is over and at least for the next parliamentary term, Mr Yanukovich will be president of Ukraine. It is encouraging that this was the result of a fair election. This also indicates that the voters did not want the various positions to be set in concrete, such as joining NATO, on the one hand, or the orientation towards Moscow, on the other. Mr Yanukovich will be well advised to continue the democratic process, not to concentrate solely on looking towards the East and to bring about noticeable improvements in the living conditions of the people of Ukraine. Otherwise, the results of the next elections will already have been decided.
My contribution today will refer to an aspect which is not mentioned very much, but which is of particular concern to me when we are talking about Ukraine. More than half a million ethnic Romanians live in this country. The authorities in Kiev have hitherto shown them little interest in terms of guaranteeing basic rights. However, we saw for the first time that during the election campaign in this country neighbouring Romania, a new concept of governance was promoted. One of the candidates guaranteed Romanians in this country that he would support the introduction of Romanian as a regional language in areas where Romanians are in the majority.
After the presidential elections, a new chapter begins in relations between the EU and Ukraine. One of the most important areas of cooperation will be the issue of energy supply. This is no accident, as the European Union, with its increasing dependency, has a notable portion of energy imports coming via its easterly neighbour. For the security of energy imports, I think it is justified that the European Union should assist Ukraine by every possible means in maintaining and modernising its energy network, especially the vital gas pipeline network. At the same time, in agreement with the conclusions of the June EU summit, I think that there is a fundamental pre-requisite for financial support: Ukraine should start its reform of the industry and make its gas industry more transparent. The lack of transparency in the system of intermediary companies has resulted in disadvantages for the citizens of Ukraine, while also hindering the security of supply for EU Member States. Furthermore, efforts aimed at expanding storage capacity are also worth supporting. In fact, establishing reserves is one of the main ways to guarantee the smooth transit of gas in Europe during the cold winter period.
The election of Viktor Yanukovich as president means that Ukraine is entering a new phase which will bring it closer to the EU. As a member of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and a European citizen, I believe that the European Union can and should tip the balance in favour of a European and democratic path for its eastern neighbour. The European Parliament Election Observation Mission welcomed that the ballot passed off lawfully without incident, thereby guaranteeing the legitimacy of the new president and marking a particular contrast to the elections which took place in 2004-2005. The change of political hue must not affect our approach to Ukraine, which must remain just as consistent and even more effective. Although it is well known that President Yanukovich is not going to weaken ties with Russia, this does not mean that he is going to move away from the EU. In order to precisely avoid the risk of this happening, however small, we must be proactive in handling relations with Ukraine, which is the only country able to guarantee stability in the area. We must show openness through dialogue and firm commitments so as to give Ukraine the necessary encouragement towards a pro-European development. I am confident in Ukraine's ability to resume the reforms and demonstrate that it is a trustworthy partner for the EU.
in writing. - Ukraine continues to be crucial for the stability and democratic development of Europe. Although the Orange Revolution to which the European Parliament so effectively contributed has disappointed most expectations, it is to be hoped that the legacy of Mr Yushchenko's Presidency - free and fair elections, people who have overcome fear when voicing their opinions and a basically independent media - will endure. It is true that a big country like Ukraine that has been deprived of independence for a long time and has suffered a real genocide - the Holodomor - will need some time to better define its European identity and future strategic goals. But we cannot look away from the responsibility of European Union policies toward Ukraine since 2004. The EU has not been eager to offer Ukraine the prospect of EU membership. The EU's support of Ukraine has proved to be mostly ambiguous and not convincing to the Ukrainians as it has often been dominated by a fear of irritating Russia. We need to realise that the main key to a genuinely democratic and good neighbourly Russia is an independent and Europe-integrated Ukraine. This will remain the EU's responsibility. Now we need to make maximum use of the Eastern Partnership.
Madam President, I have taken note of the information given about the election of Viktor Yanukovich as President of Ukraine. Although Ukraine is in a very serious situation, changes for the better can be seen in terms of respect for the law in the period since the previous elections. I hope the legal dispute over the election results will be resolved quickly and that both sides will concentrate on work to help Ukraine come out of the economic crisis and strengthen its position in the world and, in particular, to help Ukraine develop closer relations with the European Union. In view of the newly-elected President's promises to increase democratisation and ensure international stability, as well as the fact that he places great emphasis on Ukraine's accession to the European Union, I am convinced that the current good cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union should not only be continued, but extended. Representatives of all EU countries hope that Ukraine will, finally, enter a period of political stability and consensus on economic policy.
Ukraine is a European state and shares all of Europe's cultural values. Ukraine needs to implement honestly and effectively a political programme guaranteeing rights to national minorities such as Russians, Tatars, Romanians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks and others. It has to implement the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which guarantees these languages the status of regional languages. I believe that the EU must support the implementation of such measures, stressing that not a single minority should be overlooked.
For example, there is a Romanian-speaking minority in Ukraine numbering more than 410 000. It is a traditional national community with deep historical roots, which lives in harmony with the majority and other minorities, especially in the Chernivtsi Region (Northern Bukovina, Northern Bessarabia and the Hertsa Region), the Odessa Region (districts in Southern Bessarabia) and in the Transcarpathian Region (historical Maramureş Region). I think that the EU must encourage the Ukraine authorities to develop sections offering teaching in Romanian as a mother tongue in the vocational colleges and secondary schools currently operating in the towns in the regions mentioned above. In addition, the EU should cooperate with Kiev so that the Chernivtsi State University establishes sections offering teaching in Romanian as a mother tongue in all the current departments and specialties.
I am pleased that the Ukrainian elections last Sunday passed off well. The results of the elections must be acknowledged by all the parties involved as a democracy cannot be built on permanent distrust and dispute. I am sorry that Yulia Tymoshenko lost the elections. However, I am even sorrier about the numerous statements she made during the latter part of the campaign, which disputed the judgment of the International Court of Justice relating to the Black Sea continental shelf. I hope that the Ukrainian Government, regardless of whether it is going to be led by Mrs Tymoshenko or anyone else, will accept the fact that such a judgment is definitive.
Viktor Yanukovich promised the following measures to the Hungarian minority in Ukraine if he wins the election: immediate withdrawal of restrictions affecting the Hungarian education system, Hungarian primary school pupils and final-year students; unrestricted use of their mother tongue in education, justice, public administration, the media and other areas; unrestricted use of national symbols, unimpeded contact with their mother country; involvement of community representatives in local, regional and national public administration. The results of the presidential elections in regions with a higher proportion of Hungarian residents and the narrow margin of the final results indicate that the votes of the Hungarian community contributed to the victory of Mr Yanukovich to a great extent. In the heat of the campaign, Yulia Tymoshenko also promised to cancel the discriminatory measures affecting mother-tongue education. However, this did not sound credible coming from a politician who has been prime minister for 5 years and during that time showed no interest in the problems of the minorities. So the Hungarian and Ruthenian minority now put their hopes in Mr Yanukovich, expecting him to recognise the regional status of minorities and to create new grounds for relations between the majority and the minorities. However, if the new Ukrainian president fails to fulfil his promises, for example, in return for support from Ukrainian nationalists, he would not only lose the support of minority communities, but the establishment of the much-heralded European Ukraine may also be delayed for years.
The European Union should play a more active role in Ukraine; we should stop the practice that has prevailed over the last few years of the European Union treating one of the largest states in Europe in an uncertain and half-hearted way. Ukraine is a major partner in the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union and it is also the most important transit state for relations cultivated with Russia. With Viktor Yanukovich elected as president, Ukraine has a strong, easy-going leader who is open towards both Europe and Russia alike. The most important task for the new president will be to overcome the deep political divide so that a stable administration can be established and the long-overdue, comprehensive social and economic reforms can be implemented. The most important thing for the European Union now is to make its presence felt more strongly than before in Ukraine, and to establish new grounds for cooperation. The Eastern Partnership provides an excellent framework for this, and the External Action Service created pursuant to the Treaty of Lisbon will provide appropriate means. I would like to emphasise that Hungary, with Ukraine being its largest neighbour, is particularly interested in political and economic stability being established in Ukraine. It is also in our interest that relations between Ukraine and Russia are consolidated. We also very much hope that Ukraine will give up its anti-minority policies, which have encroached upon the rights of minorities in the Lower Carpathians region, including those of Hungarians.
A year ago, I was extremely concerned. When trade crashed and we were expecting world trade to develop in ways not seen since the Second World War, the situation was very serious indeed. The World Bank stated that 17 of the G20 countries had, in total, introduced 47 new trade barriers and tariffs. Russia imposed tariffs on cars, China restricted food imports, India banned imports of toys and Argentina introduced import licences for textiles and leather goods. It was almost like a protectionist arms race - a pattern from the 1930s that was worrying.
However, no trade war came about. I think it is important to stop and reflect on why that was. I think the main reason was the WTO, the global regulatory authority for trade, which forces countries to behave and not to resort to protectionism and populism. I would say that it is too early to declare the crisis over. The crisis has not passed. We all know that unemployment is highest late in the economic cycle - and it is unemployment that drives protectionism and populism. If we look around us right now, we can see that a number of countries have not yet come through the crisis; perhaps they even have the worst yet to come. I am therefore somewhat concerned when I listen to some members of the Council of Ministers, who do not say much about new markets and free trade but rather criticise globalisation and talk of protecting European companies and European jobs. That is not necessarily protectionism, but at times, they are only a hair's breadth away. It is, in any event, an expression of a mercantilism that I believe to be damaging.
However, the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well. The continual rise in job losses, stagnant, sometimes even negative, growth, and the developing social crisis are all factors that mean we can no longer afford to let jobs disappear in the name of this cult. In a period of crisis, how do we explain to employees who are losing their jobs that the main thing is to maintain deregulated trade, even at the cost of sudden and sometimes tragic relocations?
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has indeed had a detrimental impact on trade in the European Union Member States. For example, in countries like Bulgaria, exports for the first 11 months of last year fell by a whole 24% compared to the previous year, and imports by 35%. Property and tourism are sectors which have been particularly affected by this. This has an extremely powerful effect on employment. Consideration must be given to the sharp rise in business-to-business indebtedness, non-payment of national and local public contract organisations, etc.
However, a number of issues remain on the agenda, some of which have already been mentioned. Are we making effective use of European funding to combat the high level of unemployment? What can the European Union do faced with the current deficit, devaluation of the currency and high inflation, which are having a direct impact on trade? What commercial policy instruments does the European Union have available to tackle the financial crisis and its repercussions? What measures must be taken to avoid the recurrence of a crisis of such magnitude and for trade to continue expanding? What strategy do we have against countries like India and China, which are threatening to change the entire financial system? I am counting exclusively on this Europe 2020 strategy to find these answers.
In a way, the food crisis that we experienced two and a half years ago arrived before the financial crisis, and it was indeed a crisis of the world agricultural markets. In the same way, we keep being told that liberalising trade with China is good for us. I believe that, at some point, unless we incorporate social issues, monetary issues, fiscal issues and, of course, environmental issues, China will have not just a comparative advantage over Europe, it will have an absolute advantage over it.
Commissioner, you have cited the Lisbon Strategy, innovation, the green economy, and you know that this European strategy is now a failure. Indeed, if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy, we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have. Where is the definition of the industrial choices, the agricultural choices, the economic choices and, of course, the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe, so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world? Until we define these choices, we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure.
Madam President, in the current global economy, most borders are allowing a more efficient flow of people, capital and services. This, of course, is intended to produce a better standard of living. This is all very well, as long as most countries achieve a positive trade balance and a growth in GDP. The problems begin when the economy slows down, market indices fall sharply and problems start with unemployment. The opening of borders, apart from bringing a better standard of living, has caused a mutual dependence of different economies on one another. This is the other side of the coin. This can be seen clearly in the current situation. For example, the slowing down of the German economy is having a negative effect on the Polish economy, and this is because Germany is one of Poland's key export partners. Fortunately, Poland's GDP is showing positive growth, which is an exception in Europe, but it is worrying that the unemployment rate has been rising for several months. This example shows very clearly that governments should not only think about how to solve economic problems exclusively in their own countries, but they should also come to an agreement about how, together, they can develop defensive mechanisms so that in future, they will be protected from similar situations.
I think the present crisis will be a test for all of us. I am thinking principally, here, about countries belonging to the European Union. We cannot allow a situation in which some countries try to conceal their use of State interventionism, while, in the name of free competition, others are prevented from giving State aid. Of course, I do realise that particular governments may be, in a certain sense, hostages of their electorate, but if we are going to build a European Community for the good of everyone, we must make clear rules and we must keep them. We must also use our strengths - advanced technologies and human capital. Only in this way will further strengthening of cooperation between our countries be effective, and we, as citizens of the European Union, will be able to think of the future in better terms and hope that our (...).
World Bank researchers predict that, in 2010 alone, 64 million more people will be plunged into extreme poverty by the crisis and that because of it, in 2009, between 30 000 and 50 000 children have already died in Africa of malnutrition. This crisis is having devastating consequences on world trade, but the demand of the United Nations financial summit last year, for example, that the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations is the answer, is utterly wrong. According to the respected NGO War on Want, that would threaten a further 7.5 million workers with losing their jobs, including in the poorest countries.
This crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets. Not content with having precipitated the crisis, these parasites now want to exploit it to rake in further billions. Did the EU Commission see the headline in the Financial Times yesterday: 'Traders in record bet against the euro'? But what does the Commission do? It falls on its knees in front of the speculators and demands that the countries worst hit by the crisis, like Greece, make savage cuts in workers' wages, pensions and public services.
What do you think such a draconian programme of cuts is going to do for trade, either in Europe or in the world? If you cut the ability of the working class to purchase goods and services, then you cut demand for those goods and services, which means you cut millions more jobs of workers who would provide them. That, concretely, is the prescription of the Commission. Therefore, the tens of thousands of Greek workers who marched yesterday were absolutely right. Capitalism can only bring more suffering and crisis. We need to replace it with a system of human solidarity, based on the values of democratic socialism.
(HU) I would like to talk about two issues: the trade deficit and CO2 emissions. The document rightly states that the growth of the trade deficit of the European Union and the United States has contributed to the international economic crisis to a large extent. The trade deficit of the European Union grew from EUR 75 billion in 2004 to EUR 243 billion in 2008. This is a three-fold increase in 4 years. This means that the consumption of each European citizen exceeded produced value by EUR 500. Such a large trade deficit and a consumption that exceeds production to such an extent are not sustainable. Measures are required to reduce the trade deficit, because if we do not do this intentionally, the laws of economy will spontaneously enforce such a change. However, this would incur a much higher social cost. The current events in Greece illustrate this.
As regards energy, world trade is not only distorted by protectionism, but also by energy price support mechanisms. The use of oil is subsidised in a number of developing countries, with oil being available at prices lower than on the international market, while budget resources are also used to support the use of electricity. At the same time, European producers need to pay taxes, carbon dioxide quotas, if they want to use energy in production. Copenhagen made it clear that developing countries wish to hinder a climate protection agreement as they are not willing to accept sanctions related to cuts. Measures are required to prevent this, as several economists have now pointed out that cheap carbon dioxide gives a more competitive edge to China than cheap labour. If we do not reduce energy consumption, there is a danger that again and again ...
(SV) Madam President, our continent is a rich one. The EU must shoulder a particular responsibility for maintaining free and fair trade. The financial crisis is creating a global economic recession that depressed trade by 10% in 2009, as has been stated, such that trade is now at the same level as in 2005. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable when their exports fall and they have problems obtaining bank financing. For the ACP countries, for example, trade in goods represents 50% of their trade. These countries are thus extremely sensitive to crises. A 1% drop in growth results in 20 million people falling into poverty.
Here, the EU must shoulder its responsibility as a rich part of the world and ensure that the financial crisis does not force more people into poverty and exclusion. The EU must work to ensure that the poorest countries receive increased levels of effective aid and debt relief where appropriate. In this context, my friends, I believe that a number of the countries that you come from could do more to ensure that the aid provided by your home countries is increased, improved and made more efficient. We should not always call on the EU; there are some things we can do on the home front.
(PL) Madam President, one area in which we should look for ways to fight the crisis is the trade in agricultural products. In recent years, under pressure from the World Trade Organisation, we have introduced many voluntary restrictions on the production and export of agricultural products in the European Union. We carried out, for example, a huge reform of the sugar market, which reduced European sugar production by one third and closed down many sugar refineries. Many farms stopped growing sugar beet, we increased unemployment and did not achieve any social or economic benefits. It was a present for the big sugar concerns, which moved their production out of Europe, and today we import sugar from them.
I think that during the crisis, we should give strong protection to our economy and our producers. I am not talking, here, about protectionism, but about a policy of equal opportunities which, at present, our producers do not have. A variety of high standards are in force in the European Union, for example, in agriculture there are standards for animal welfare. It is right to promote these standards, but we should also require that these same standards be met by those who export their products to the European Union. If, for example, we bring in a ban on battery hens, we should not at the same time import eggs from countries where this method is in use. We should act in a similar way on many other matters. We should observe a simple rule - the same requirements for exporters as for our own producers, because without this, apart from the economic crisis (...).
What is even more alarming is that, on 1 January 2010, a customs union came into existence between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. As a consequence, a total of 30% of the EU's product lines have seen increased tariffs. The main problem is, of course, that Russia, like Belarus and Kazakhstan, is not a member of the WTO, and is therefore not bound by the WTO rules restricting the unilateral increase of import tariffs and other trade-restrictive measures. Since Russia is not a member of the WTO, we do not have a dispute settlement mechanism with them.
In my country, there is a saying that attack is the best form of defence. I would like to pick up on what Mrs Andrikienhas just said about the specific measures that Russia has taken. We need to ask what effective options we have open to us that will allow us to go on the offensive against those trading partners who have not kept to the agreements made in the G20, who have introduced protectionist measures, who have closed the markets and who have helped to bring about an even greater fall in worldwide economic performance than would otherwise have been the case.
Should we not make more proactive use of our Global Europe strategy and forcefully implement the points it contains? Is it not now the right time to address our interests proactively instead of simply preventing protectionism? I have in mind a possible new initiative which will allow us to make progress within the WTO at last. I think we should take the logical step of negotiating free trade agreements quickly. We have one result in South Korea. However, what has happened with regard to India, Canada, Colombia and Peru? Would we not be sending out a very positive signal if we could make progress on these free trade agreements now?
Many other Members have referred to the developing countries. Is this not the ideal opportunity to bring about some progress at last in the Economic Partnership Agreements so that the developing countries and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) could be better integrated into world trade and so that effective measures could be taken to bring about economic growth and combat poverty? Over recent decades, it has become clear that the states which have taken part in world trade have had the highest levels of growth. I look forward to hearing your answer, Mr De Gucht.
The European Union must first of all find a happy medium between ultra-free trade and protectionism. To my mind, this third way must be embodied by the creation of a fair trade framework. The European Union is armed with certain values: respect for the protection of intellectual property, fairness in terms of investments, access to markets, the fight against non-tariff trade barriers and respect for social and environmental standards. Consequently, it has a duty to ensure that these values are accepted as principles by India and China, emerging countries which are not only our customers and competitors, but also our partners.
(HU) We must face up to the fundamental question of whether free trade, the current system controlled by the WTO, is good for the people, or whether we should be contemplating a new guiding principle, which I would rather not call protectionism but economic self-determination? I would like to propose looking at the differences between these two guiding principles in three areas. What does global world trade mean in its current form and volume in terms of creating and preserving jobs in Europe, especially when we think about small traders, SMEs, family businesses and small farms in European countries, which are adrift and have lost opportunities to progress because of the current global, liberalised world trade? If we think of solidarity, is it good for the poor, developing countries that, instead of developing their own agriculture and industry, they are obliged to open their markets? Is it good for the environment that goods are delivered from great distances?
I would like to propose that as an initial step, at least with regard to agriculture and food, we contemplate the introduction of the principle of food self-determination, which means that communities and countries have the right to decide what they want to produce and how they want to produce it, and then how they want to sell it. Consumers are entitled to quality, healthy and nutritious food, and we know that this is not the food that has been shipped from thousands of kilometres away, but the locally produced, locally processed and locally sold food.
The second point I want to make is that the banks were primarily responsible for many of the ills which we are seeing nowadays, but what happened? A new theory came into being - they were too big to fail. I think, rather than be too big to fail, many of them are too big for their own boots. That is seen in the immoral salaries that some of them are getting and the grotesque bonuses they are also getting. No banker should be getting more than the Prime Minister of his country, and we should work towards...
(PL) Madam President, international trade, alongside the financial sector, is the area of the world economy which has suffered most as a result of the economic crisis. It is estimated that world trade turnover fell last year by around 10% as a result of the crisis. In addition, the policy of protectionism adopted by many countries as a basic tool for fighting the recession is having a disadvantageous effect on trade. The advantages of free trade in a global economy ought not to need explaining to anyone. It is safe to say that the prosperity which free-market countries achieved in the second half of the 20th century was, in large measure, the fruit of free trade, which developed dynamically in this period. The fall in world trade, the rise in unemployment, especially in developing countries and, with this, the growth of poverty and social exclusion - this adverse trend can be stopped by restoring dynamic trade on fair and just (...).
So I staunchly believe that we should have free trade agreements with major economic partners, that we should make a success of the Doha Round and that we should further liberalise international trade, but that does not mean that we should not take into account the fact that this international trade also has to be fair and that we are entitled to protect our interests. The Commission is certainly going to do so when necessary and we will use the TDI mechanisms we have to have an impact on what we consider to be unfair distortions of trade.
Some very specific questions have also been asked, by Mr Jadot, for example, on the meeting on 4 February at the WTO and what the result of this was. Well, the main message at that meeting was that the rules of the General Agreement on Trade in Services are not an obstacle to the right of countries to ensure effective financial regulation. The reason is that GATS has a very broad scope for financial prudential measures, so this financial regulation, be it at national or European level, is certainly not contradictory to the GATS rules.
I can agree that the food crisis of a couple of years ago, which was still not completely resolved and digested, let us say, has added to big imbalances, especially for the developing countries. You can say a lot about developing countries, about good governance and so on, but you certainly cannot lay the blame on the developing countries for being at the origin of the financial crisis. That is obvious, and they are very severely hit by that crisis, so we should take that into due consideration.
There was also the question by David Martin on the Robin Hood tax. First of all, I must say that I like the name Robin Hood much better than Tobin. But apart from that, I fear the Robin Hood tax is facing the same problems as the Tobin tax, that you can only do it if it happens on a global scale. You should also bear in mind that doing this, even on a global scale, would imply a very costly implementing mechanism to put it into place. President Barroso said about the Tobin tax that we are ready to support it as long as everybody else does, and that, of course, is the sticking point in all this.
This is not a debate on Greece so I am not going to go into the details of it, but I think, sincerely speaking, that some fault also lies with Greece itself. What you cannot have in a global economy, and what you cannot have in the European Union either, is moral hazard. Being a Member State of the European Union also implies some obligations. So Member States who get into a difficult position - and certainly we are ready to support them and help them whenever possible - should also realise that they have to obey the rules and if they obey the rules, then probably they will not get into the difficult situation they are in now.
in writing. - (HU) The shrinking of world trade has had a particularly detrimental effect on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as the drop in demand primarily affected products which have played a significant role in exports, such as cars, consumer electronics, and so on. At the same time, these countries have also been hit hard by the credit crunch. Boosting exports would be extremely important to ensure that these countries are able to recover from the difficulties arising from this double pressure and the resultant social problems, such as growing unemployment. Financing for exporters seems to be a major obstacle in this area, as payment periods have become longer, credit has become more expensive and more difficult to access, while credit insurance conditions have also deteriorated. This is why programmes should be developed targeting the countries in question, especially EU Member States, to assist them in overcoming these difficulties.
The trend for outsourcing in the 1990s has led to capital and also expertise being transferred abroad within the world economy. The fact that jobs have been and are being created in countries with low wages has resulted in average wages falling in Central and Western Europe, which, in its turn, has caused a fall in consumption levels. The consequence of this is that European companies are no longer making the majority of their profits from producing goods, which is their core business. They are attempting to improve their results by means of financial transactions and speculation. This is the point at which we must start. We need to impose a quota on how much ordinary share capital companies can invest in stocks and shares and also on how much of their reserves they can deposit in financial packages in third countries. Secondly, we need regulations for the companies that have suffered damage as a result of the crisis. Thirdly, the economy requires not only fresh capital for the banks, which were one of the main causes of the crisis, but also and, more importantly, new regulations for money transfers, strict guidelines on the sale of credit packages and an independent supervisory body for the new and flourishing trading business, which includes areas such as short selling, that should be banned.
If the forecasts presented just now by Mr Moreira are right, then the predicted decline in world trade will be the biggest since the Second World War. It goes without saying that both Member States of the European Union and countries which do not belong to the Community are taking measures to increase competitiveness and overcome the effects of the crisis. Research carried out by the Centre of Economic Policy Research has shown that since the first meeting of the Group of Twenty devoted to the crisis, 425 legislative initiatives have been undertaken to combat the effects of the crisis. Some countries have resorted to protectionist practices, while others are trying to liberalise trade. In view of the fact that the economy is a system of connected vessels, is the European Commission monitoring legislative initiatives being undertaken both within the European Union and around the world? Does the European Commission, when taking anti-crisis measures, take these into account? As protectionist and liberalising measures accumulate, a situation will arise in which they are mutually exclusive and will have no effect on world trade.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Daniel Caspary, Peter Šťastný, Paweł Zalewski, David Martin, Gianluca Susta, Kader Arif, Michael Theurer, Niccolò Rinaldi, Metin Kazak, Marielle De Sarnez and Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists, on the free trade agreement between the EU and South Korea - B7-0001/2010).
We are familiar with the many expert reports which were drawn up before the start of negotiations and which clearly indicated the many possible benefits for European industry and the European economy. There is likely to be a positive impact on the mechanical engineering, chemical, pharmaceutical, food and service industries. All of these sectors and many others hope to gain major benefits from the agreement. However, the main protests are coming from the car industry. There are difficulties with the duty drawback system, with the question of the amount of parts from foreign suppliers that can be used in cars from South Korea and with the issue of environmental standards which remain unresolved.
What are the real advantages of this bilateral agreement, when 50% of the trade between the European Union and Korea concerns the automotive sector, when the disparity between the 700 000 Korean cars exported to us as opposed to the 27 000 European cars imported by Korea is glaringly evident? What is the sense in providing indirect aid of approximately EUR 1 600 for each Korean car sold in Europe when some European governments find it difficult to provide incentives for buying and selling cars to stimulate consumption? How can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries?
Free and fair trade forms the basis for Europe's prosperity. We must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies. Free trade agreements like this one with South Korea can make an important contribution to stimulating world trade, growth and employment. However, it is in the nature of agreements of this kind, that, depending on their specific structure, they bring more benefits for some sectors of industry than for others. It is our job in Parliament to weigh up carefully the impact on different industries and sectors within the EU. In order to do this, we need the relevant data and impact assessments and it is the Commission's task to provide them. However, despite many requests from the committee and in the plenary session, we have not yet received data which we believe to be satisfactory. This is the reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has joined with other groups to ask this question.
The free trade agreement with South Korea is the only agreement with a developed country which does not include a ban on duty drawbacks. This may lead to one-sided cost benefits for South Korean industry. As the Commission has assured us on several occasions, the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause, which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria. However, we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved. The system must be applicable in practice. It must not be the case that the safeguard clauses are worthless because the companies cannot provide the necessary proof. As the agreement seems to contain one-sided regulations and as it sets a precedent for future agreements, for example, with India or with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we feel that the specific wording of the safeguard clauses, the procedure for settling disputes and the other regulations relating to the application of the agreement are of central importance.
We are therefore calling on the Commission to submit the free trade agreement together with the provisions on its application to Parliament for approval. We want a decision quickly. For this reason, a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force. I know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: Will the development of the European External Action Service lead to it playing a stronger role in trade policy? In our opinion, at least, this should be included.
Any free trade agreement must be based on the principle of reciprocity or mutual benefit, but the potential burden on European car manufacturers remains unclear and of great concern to us. The Commission has assured us that Korea is actively liberalising its import regime. The level of duties that Korea can refund under the duty drawback are gradually being reduced. The negotiators are convinced that the economic relevance of the duty drawback will therefore diminish over time. What evidence does the Commission have to support this argument? If the Commission finds itself resorting to repeated or continued use of this safeguard mechanism, will it consider reviewing negotiations to extend the transfer period?
According to one study, the FTA will create substantial new trade in goods and services of 19.1 billion for the EU compared to 12.8 billion for Korea. Existing studies have not identified any sectors that would be negatively affected by the FTA, but in case of serious injury or threat thereof, the Commission would not hesitate to activate the safeguard procedures built into the agreement. Let me also remind you that, in the event of such a necessity, we have the possibility of employing the support measures under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
In relation to this free trade agreement with South Korea, as you say, there are undoubtedly many positives for Europe in this agreement, but for our car-making industry, it is, and remains, a disastrous agreement. Mr Caspary also made this point. Just take a look at the figures, Commissioner. For every car that we export to South Korea from Europe, 15 come the other way. We currently have a ratio of 15:1, and that is primarily the result of non-tariff barriers to trade in South Korea.
I believe that we still have plenty of time to adapt this situation for our automotive sector, and you were quite right to refer to the safeguard clause. I accept that such safeguarding measures exist, but we are asking, first and foremost, for there to be a fundamental review of the impact of this agreement on the automotive sector. The numbers and the trends are much too alarming. The reality, in any case - and you know this better than I do - is that the US Government is currently negotiating with the South Koreans about making adaptations to a similar agreement that they have.
Firstly, we said in my report that we needed much better access to the Korean agricultural market. Well, Korean agricultural tariffs are going to come down by 75% over the first seven years of this agreement; we wanted our geographical indicators protected, our Whisky, our Champagnes, our wines, our hams and so on are going to be protected in Korea as a result of this agreement. And they are not, as one of my colleagues indicated, insignificant. Scottish whisky sells GBP 137 million worth a year into the Korean market already so with this deal, we could see a significant increase.
Is this a perfect deal? Well, of course it is not. Are there things in it that I would not want in it, of course there are, but negotiations mean that you have to come and go, but on balance, is it a good deal for Europe? Yes. Is it a good deal for Korea? Yes. Is it a good deal, potentially, for the world economy? Yes. So we should not shilly-shally on this: we should get on and sign it.
For us in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although the duty drawback is acceptable for the WTO, even though it is already practised, it is effectively an export subsidy and a slackening of the rule of origin is a step backwards as far as transparency is concerned. These two principles will soon constitute a precedent for our other trade partners. We know that the Commission has driven a hard bargain, but, in the words of the Korean proverb, 'even the best make mistakes'.
Mr President, as you said, this agreement breaks new ground. It breaks new ground, but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it. Perhaps for the first time, in fact, we see in the outcome of the negotiations that there are losers, which one accepts, but within the context of trade negotiations with third parties. It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who, in Europe, would lose out in an open trade relationship.
Thirdly, this agreement also breaks new ground because you refer to a EUR 1.6 billion reduction in customs duties from which we will benefit on the Korean market. Just what do these figures mean, however? I am an elected representative for the west of France region, and more specifically for Brittany. If you have visited Brittany, Mr De Gucht, you will know that, these days, green algae and ground water pollution associated with the intensification of pig farming are a huge problem.
Lastly, this agreement again breaks new ground because, for the first time, an environmental derogation will be called for. We are continually told that Europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change. The reality is that we are reduced to negotiating derogations with South Korea on CO2 emissions from cars because the automobile lobby has been very powerful in Europe when it comes to pushing back the deadlines for the introduction of restrictions on CO2 emissions and because now, it is obliged to obtain derogations abroad.
There will be enormous benefit to both Europe and Korea on the signing of this deal. I know there are concerns and I have listened to those concerns. We have heard them here tonight about the car industry. But, you know, I think if we are going to depend on the car industry - and we are going to totally defend it - then I think we are picking the wrong particular area in which to do this, and certainly General Motors would not be the most important in my area, as far as I would be concerned.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, we have decried the disastrous consequence of the liberalisation of the global economy for many sectors of economic activity, particularly in some Member States and the regions that are most dependent on these sectors. We are talking about the destruction of productive activity and jobs, a serious impact on the capacity to create and distribute wealth, an increasing dependence on foreign markets, chronic and growing imbalances in trade; in short, economic and social breakdown.
We are also talking about the attacks on workers' rights, social dumping, the ruination of millions of small producers and many small and medium-sized enterprises. These are consequences of the gradual liberalisation of international trade which their advocates cannot ignore. I recall here the clothing and textile industry, which is particularly pertinent to this agreement, and a study by the Directorate-General for Employment and the Eurofund, which presents scenarios for a decrease of 20 to 25% of Community jobs by 2020, while acknowledging a scenario where 50% of jobs in this sector would be lost. I also recall, however, sectors such as electronics and the component manufacturing industry in the automotive sector, already mentioned here. These complaints give rise to questions that continue to go unanswered.
South Korea has to compete with the economic and military giant to the north of it, China, which is, at the same time, the country's main trading partner. In competitive terms, China has an almost inexhaustible resource in the form of cheap labour. Consequently, China is also the country's main trade competitor. By imposing quality requirements on South Korea, the EU can make the country's goods better suited for export to the US and Europe - much better than those from China, and I imagine we are all interested in bringing that about.
On 21 January, Opel announced the closure of its Anvers site, the production activities of which will be relocated to South Korea. Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated? Allow me to spot a connection there. During this period of economic crisis in which the workers are the first to pay for the mistakes of the financiers, the Commission is duty-bound to consider, now more than ever, the job-related consequences of the agreements that it negotiates.
We expect answers from you today, Commissioner. First of all, we want to know whether your Directorate-General has assessed the impact of this agreement on jobs in Europe, for I must tell you that the figure greedily announced, that is, the EUR 19 billion profit that European exporters are expected to make, does not convince us. Where does this figure come from? On what study is it based? Leaving aside the expected positive effects, however, have the negative effects also been taken into account?
Nevertheless I feel reassured because, for the first time ever, Parliament will soon be able to express an opinion on this text under the ordinary legislative procedure. I would, however, like to point out that Europe's employment problem will not be solved by palliative measures taken on a case-by-case basis. That is why I, together with my whole group, am calling for a real European industrial policy, one that represents a genuine strategy for the future of our industries, to be drawn up at last.
(PL) Mr President, we are discussing, today, a very important agreement, which is going to be a model for agreements with other countries in the Far East, so careful reflection and analysis are needed. We must not be pressurised into acting too quickly. I support free competition, and think its influence on stabilisation of the political situation and on economic development is unquestionable, but it must be competition which is balanced, and which is based on competition between technologies or product production costs, and not on instruments such as duty drawback, which is included in the agreement and serves the interests, quite frankly, of only one party.
We have an economic crisis, and we must, today, be particularly sensitive to the situation in Europe - we must take particular responsibility for the future of European industry. This is not only a question of the motor industry, but is also about the electronics and textiles industries. Numerous branches of industry, including many from Poland, are complaining about this agreement. Therefore, it is my conviction that we should act as follows. Firstly, we must be sure of the effects of the agreement, and for this we should also work with those industries which have reported misgivings about the agreement, and not only with those which think they will win on this agreement. I expect the Commission to produce a very comprehensive analysis of the consequences of bringing this agreement into force. Secondly, we must look very carefully at the safeguarding measures and at how to construct them so that the agreement will, in fact, be advantageous to both sides, and not just to South Korea. Thirdly, we cannot introduce this agreement provisionally before Parliament is sure that it is, in fact, advantageous to all countries of the European Union and does not establish any kind of unjustified advantage for Korean industry.
(DE) Mr President, the EU should only conclude free trade agreements with countries which show full respect for human rights. It seems fundamental to me that the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation should be implemented and, above all, complied with. The labour clauses in the contract are good, but they do not go far enough. There have been cases in Korea, in particular in recent months, in which there have been fundamental breaches of trade union rights, such as the right to collective bargaining and the right to freedom of organisation. Throughout the negotiating process, the European trade unions and, in particular, the unions in the metal industry, have highlighted these cases, specifically with regard to the problems to be expected in the automotive sector.
(DE) Mr President, of course, it is true that there are serious economic problems. That is very much the case. However, the company management and, in particular, Mr Reilly, have breached a delta agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, the Opel site in Antwerp was given the assurance that SUVs would be produced there. These cars are now not being manufactured in Antwerp, but in South Korea. As far as I see it, this is, in very simple terms, a case of moving existing operations from Opel in Antwerp to South Korea.
(DE) Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I have three questions for you. My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions. The fact that employees' rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action. Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of 'disrupting operations'. This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong. I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation. Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees' rights?
Many people have already spoken about the automotive sector. Well, we, both I and my home region, but also still your region too, to an extent, Commissioner, have discovered, in the meantime, what that impact is. The Opel car plant in Antwerp is closing down, and the trade unions there - and these are people who have been working on this for years and years - are absolutely convinced that this trade agreement is a very important part of Opel's much talked-about business plan, a plan which we simply do not get to see and which lies at the heart of the decision not to build the SUV in Antwerp.
I have two questions for you about this. Do you know what the impact of this agreement is on employment, the effect on employment for each economic sector? If not, are you prepared - and I want to press you on this - to have an impact study carried out at this point, in order to ensure that we, in Parliament, have the information that we need when we ultimately have to give our consent? My second question is, do you intend, in future - with this being the start of your term of office - to consistently carry out this kind of impact study at the social level?
But the overall question pointed out by the Commissioner of the EUR 19.1 billion advantage to the European Union and EUR 12.5 billion to South Korea is a good deal in my book. If it was the other way round, we might have cause for concern. Also, we cannot underestimate the political importance of South Korea psychologically in extending the hand across the oceans to Asia - something which is very important to them - and also, where we are concerned, in re-establishing our place in the world, which was somewhat undermined in Copenhagen.
However, we note that, firstly, there is a problem concerning the information given to Parliament, particularly with regard to the safeguard clauses, then a problem concerning the method used, since we have already been told that it might be possible to implement temporary provisions or temporarily to implement the agreement without even waiting for Parliament's assent, and finally, a problem concerning the clarity and transparency of the trade framework - this was raised by Mr Rinaldi - since, through the duty drawback, we could in fact have an agreement indirectly concluded with China. I believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreements.
(PL) Mr President, the free trade agreement with South Korea seems a very good development. An agreement on a free trade area will lead to a significant growth in reciprocal trade. Thanks to the elimination of Korean import duties of around EUR 1.6 billion and EU import duties of around EUR 1.1 billion, there will be a significant liberalisation of trade in important sectors of industry and in services. This concerns mainly telecommunications, environment protection, transport, finance and legal services. In addition, the free trade agreement will contribute to an increase in transparency on the question of intellectual property protection and public procurement. Thanks to the agreement, Korea will also honour EU certificates and quality standards. The agreement is particularly important in the present economic situation, because it will allow for faster development in EU countries. We realise, however (...).
That implies, of course, that there will be a debate in your committee. I already said during the hearing that I am not going to make a proposal for an early, provisional application unless Parliament has itself pronounced on the agreement, whether as formal ratification by Parliament or by some other procedure that we can establish between the INTA Committee and the Commission. That remains open and can be discussed, but in any case, Parliament will have the opportunity to give its political judgment on the agreement before any proposals for early application are put forward.
Something that I think is actually far more important in estimating the market situation is the fact that South Korean manufacturers have recently opened major factories in Europe, namely in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, which will be capable of producing around half a million cars between them on an annual basis, so the reality is perhaps that, in future, Korean cars produced in Europe will largely, in effect, be the cars that reach the market here. What you have there is a clear shift, and so what you actually see across the car market as a whole is that there is a displacement taking place towards the major markets where, in the end, cars can be bought and sold.
I will, perhaps, make one last comment about the tension between bilateral and multilateral negotiations, an issue also raised by Mr Moreira. Negotiations based on the Doha Round have been taking place since 2001, which is now nine years, and there is still no solution to the impasse. I am a great supporter of multilateralism, and I think that we do also need to bring a positive conclusion to Doha, specifically retaining the development elements that it contains. I believe this also because its multilateral framework also provides the greatest legal certainty for international trade. I do think, however, that while we await the conclusion of the Doha Round - which I hope will be in 2010 or at the latest in early 2011 - we cannot sit on our hands in relation to the bilateral front.
What I think is very important is that, when it comes to bilateral arrangements, we only conclude agreements that go further than Doha, so as not to undermine what is decided in the Doha Round, insofar as we are setting higher criteria. That, too, explains the drawing up of the free trade agreement with South Korea. It is not, in my opinion, of such a nature that it undermines multilateralism. If we were to undercut the multilateral track, then that would indeed be the effect, but that is not the intention, nor will it be in the forthcoming negotiations.
The risks of infection following an accident are not insignificant. Experts tell us the chances of infection are one in three for hepatitis B, 1 in 30 for hepatitis C and 1 in 300 for HIV. Take the case of Juliet Young. Juliet was a nurse who died in 2008, seven years after contracting HIV while taking blood from an infected patient in a London hospital. Juliet accidentally pricked her thumb on the needle after it slipped when she was taking a sample. Or the case of a dental nurse working in a prison who was pricked by a needle that was used on an inmate who had hepatitis A, B, and C and was HIV positive. Imagine the agonising wait that she had; she has now discovered that she has contracted hepatitis C. This nurse, and many others like her, are continuing to campaign on this issue.
I first became involved in 2004 when I visited a hospital in my constituency at the instigation of Health First Europe, and then on World Aids Day on 1 December that year I hosted an exhibition with Stephen Hughes in this Parliament. Healthcare workers from across the European Union visited us, visited the Parliament, desperate for our help. Those of you who had the opportunity to meet with those nurses and other healthcare workers could not have failed to have been moved by their plight, and in 2006 we passed a Parliament resolution on protecting European healthcare workers from blood-borne infections due to needle-stick injuries. This resolution called on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to amend Directive 2000/54/EC on biological agents within three months. This proposal never came, but Stephen Hughes and I did not give up the fight.
author. - Mr President, this is an important piece of health and safety legislation. Liz has outlined some of the background to it. It has been a long time in the making - six years from the first meetings we had, as she has mentioned. It is good to see Commissioner Andor here this morning, but it is a pity, in a way, that Commissioner Špidla is not here. We have often criticised him here in this Chamber, but we could have congratulated him this morning for eventually taking the initiative to bring forward this proposal on needle-stick injuries, sharps injuries.
We took a while to persuade him to act. His services, in fact, were the people who kept advising that he should not act, that the directive agreed in 2000 on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to biological agents, combined with the risk assessment elements of the 1989 framework directive, were enough to prevent these sorts of injuries, but eventually we persuaded those services that, with one million injuries per year, clearly something was wrong. We needed specific legislation to address this problem, as they have in the United States and in parts of Spain, and it works there very effectively.
Eventually the Commissioner agreed to act and in 2008, as Liz has said, did draft an amendment to the 2000 directive, but then HOSPEEM and EPSU, the public service unions, signalled their desire to formulate an agreement. They formulated that agreement. I am glad that they have. It is a good agreement, but it is a little ambiguous in certain parts. This is why I have tabled an amendment which has been agreed in the Employment Committee, to seek the publication by the Commission of guidance to accompany the directive to ensure the smooth and uniform transposition of this directive into law in all Member States.
Liz has mentioned the trauma that people affected by needle-stick injuries face. I have met people during the six years that we have worked on this subject who have suffered needle-stick injuries, and I would really emphasise that trauma. I met a doctor who gave up medical practice because of a needle-stick injury. I met a person who has HIV as a result of a needle-stick injury. I have met people who turned out not to be infected, but only after months of uncertainty as to whether they were infected or not. I have also met garbage collectors and prison officers who have suffered needle-stick injuries. They are not covered by this agreement. That is another area that we need to think about for the future.
I also agree with you that the entry into force of this agreement will represent an important contribution to the protection of workers active in the hospital and healthcare sector. With this agreement, and hopefully the forthcoming adoption by the Council of the proposed directive, workers in the hospital and healthcare sector will benefit from an integrated approach, establishing policies in risk assessment, risk prevention, training, information, awareness-raising and so on. Such measures, which are also minimum requirements, are not only much welcomed but above all absolutely necessary.
You have already been made aware, and I am not going to waste too much time in reminding you, that the framework agreement is a very important legal instrument for health workers. They are affected by more than one million accidents each year, which also implicate serious health risks, such as viral infections, hepatitis C, AIDS and so forth. However, this is not only of significance to health workers but also to hospital patients and their families. Essentially, millions of Europeans will be better protected by this instrument.
Firstly, the importance of health and safety in the workplace. It is crucial to create a work environment which is as safe as possible for workers, for families and for citizens. In human terms, we have already referred to all the implications of these types of injuries for workers and for citizens, but there are also implications in economic terms. A few days ago in this House, the Bilbao Agency spoke to us about some of the campaigns it is carrying out to promote health and safety and it even revealed economic studies which demonstrate that in Australia, for example, accidents and illnesses account for more than 6% of GDP in the national economy. What is the price paid for a lack of social security? What is the price paid for a lack of hygiene and safety in the workplace? It is therefore an investment in human capital, but also an investment in civilisation and economic terms.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I was not going to take my speaking time on behalf of the group but I thought I could actually split it and come in afterwards but apparently, on a resolution, that is not the case; so I was informed this morning that I was coming in now. It does give me the opportunity to thank all the shadow rapporteurs whom I did not thank before; also to again thank Stephen Hughes, because it was Stephen and I in 2004 that actually went round the hospitals with John Bowis, who was a Conservative MEP. The three of us from the political parties went out to the hospitals to find out for ourselves, and I think that was what was so important.
In this place we have to be driven by what is actually needed by the people on the ground and by listening to nurses and doctors and healthcare workers, it was important to take their views into account. Stephen mentioned implementing guidelines, and I would like to find out really whether you do know whether the Commission is thinking of bringing forward any implementing guidelines for this; I think it is very important that we have these. Also, I was wondering whether you knew of the timetable that the Council was thinking of because it is absolutely important that we get the timetable through very quickly because after all those healthcare workers have waited so many years.
We do not want any more needle-stick injuries unnecessarily during that waiting time. We have had too many over the last few years. Also the point which has already been made that although this is for the health sector only at the present moment I would like to see it extended to other sectors like the prisons in particular. I think it is very important that prison officers are protected as well. There are so many things that are important for those particular workers but one of the key things for this is recapable needles. I think along with all the other issues in the resolution it is very important that those healthcare workers are not subjected to unnecessary needle-stick injuries.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to thank Stephen Hughes and Liz Lynne for their work on this and indeed to welcome this action, although we would like to have seen it earlier. As has been pointed out, the USA has had legislation in place since 2001. We can now see such legislation in certain parts of the European Union, and at last we are catching up, but, of course, not before many people will already have been affected by this problem.
In terms of the risk, the World Health Organisation estimates that, while 90% of exposures to this risk are in the developing world, 90% of reports about occupational infection occur in the United States and the European Union. We know that there is a major issue of under-reporting sharps injuries: estimates range between 40% and 75% and that is huge. Therefore I think we should welcome the fact that, in the social partners' agreement, clause 11 talks about the duty to report under a no-blame culture.
Ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on prevention from sharp injuries is historically the first agreement between sectoral social partners. In view of the fact that there are estimated to be more than one million cases a year of sharp injuries in hospitals in Europe, we do not need convincing here that this is a step in the right direction, as it should be possible to prevent these injuries through proper adherence to the agreement. In practice this will help to create a safe working environment and to protect health workers from blood-transmitted infections caused by sharp injuries.
I would like to emphasize at this point that the agreement between employers and employees is in its way a completely unique European legal instrument, which at national level has no parallel in most Member States. This form of self-regulation, where those affected by a given problem themselves agree in the form of a legal regulation on its resolution, is in my view a model example of European regulation. It is not the same situation as with CO2 emissions, tax harmonisation or the standardisation of public services, where companies and their employees must passively comply with whatever we and the Member States throw at them, and at great cost too.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to tell you how delighted I am this morning that we have agreed this proposal for a directive on the prevention of sharps injuries. We have here a real health issue, which we must regulate as quickly as possible. We all know the importance and the dramatic consequences of this type of injury. I feel I must let you know, Commissioner, that I am confident you will provide a rapid solution for this agreement, which will take us several steps forward on this issue.
I should like to thank Mrs Lynne for all her work. I should like equally to thank Mr Hughes, because it is our responsibility as MEPs to see to it that our fellow citizens are protected. They are healthcare professionals, of course - we have spoken a lot about them. They are cleaners - you have mentioned prison officers - but I should also like to mention people working in the school environment, in all areas of medicine in schools. However, well beyond this, I consider that it is a question of educating all our fellow citizens, who must not make healthcare workers or those workers that subsequently handle blunt objects take unnecessary risks.
Precisely because of the numerous serious risks that are presented all too often on a daily basis, the healthcare profession is considered unattractive, so much so that it has suffered from a shortage of staff in recent years. Moreover, as has already been mentioned here, the cost for the individual healthcare services that have to deal with the stressful situations to which healthcare workers are subjected during the various monitoring periods, and of the diagnostic tests which, as a protocol, last for at least six months from the time of the accident, is considerable, and then there are the costs associated with the professionals who have unfortunately contracted the disease.
(PL) Mr President, we are talking about a problem which has, indeed, grown to be one of the most significant in the area of healthcare. I will mention some statistics here. In the European Union, around a million of these unfortunate sharp injuries occur annually. In the United States, it is estimated to be a matter of around 380 000, but the Americans themselves say this figure is an underestimate. Of course, we must stress that this mainly concerns healthcare workers, but there is another aspect, too: we are also talking about patients who are also at risk from this. In these cases, and we have to be honest here, we are faced with the problem of the huge sums which hospitals are having to pay in compensation. It is clear, as other speakers have already said, that prevention is of absolutely fundamental significance here. For prevention is always significantly cheaper than treatment.
The resolution, in my opinion, is fully deserving of support. It is an answer to expectations expressed by the healthcare sector, and its importance is enhanced because the problem is growing. The problem of compensation is also growing, and claims are being made by healthcare workers as well as patients. Indeed, the financial aspect is not insignificant, either. My political group, on whose behalf I speak, supports the motion for a resolution. We think this is how we can respond to what is, in fact, a certain challenge of our time, and also meet the needs of consumers and workers in the healthcare sector in the countries of the European Union.
Sometimes we say that Europe needs to get closer to its citizens. With this debate, we have certainly managed to do so. I was talking to a friend of my own age, a newly-qualified doctor, and when I told him about this debate, he said to me, with a great deal of pleasure, that this was absolutely crucial and that we should try and explain exactly what we were doing to everybody in Europe. It is important to prevent and to inform those working in hospitals about the risks they run. It is indeed crucial that we explain to everybody that, when they work such long hours, when spaces are sometimes confined, when patient numbers are very high, it is crucial for these people to be able to take, at the very least, the most important measures needed.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say I am glad that this proposal enjoys such broad support in Parliament. I regret that the process lasted longer than many of you expected, but I would like to say that I am absolutely convinced that social dialogue has to play a role: we have to respect the opinion of the social partners. This not only enhances the legitimacy of a decision, it also helps with its implementation, because those who participate in the creation of a new rule are more interested in its success. This is very important.
The healthcare sector is clearly an important sector; we have to give it a lot of devotion and attention. It is not only that workers in the hospital and healthcare sector are exposed to sharp injuries and infections, we all know that they also work very long hours. So we have to take a kind of comprehensive approach when considering groups like this, which are very important, especially in times of crisis when the expected fiscal consolidation will affect the conditions these people work in. This is why this should be very high on our agenda, as it is on my personal agenda.
The compromise is essentially that the Council approved the text for the microfinance instrument adopted by Parliament at first reading, which was important for a quick launch. The other important part of the compromise is that EUR 60 million is reallocated from PROGRESS and EUR 40 million from the margin, while financing instruments of up to EUR 20 million can be reinstated in PROGRESS upon recommendation of the Commission. I would like to ask the Council to read the text of the communication made in this matter, and it would be important to publish this when the text of the agreement is published in the Official Journal.
The financial contribution from the European Union budget for the facility, for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013, has been set at EUR 100 million, to be partly financed by a reduction of EUR 60 million in the Progress programme. When presenting its draft budgets, the Commission will leave a sufficient unallocated margin under the expenditure ceiling of Heading 1a, whereby the budgetary authority - the Council and Parliament - may decide to increase the amount of the Progress programme by a maximum of EUR 20 million over the period 2011-2013, in conformity with point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management.
Parliament is right to call the Council and the Commission and the United States to account. It is our responsibility - even more so with the Treaty of Lisbon - and we must assume it. Parliament is right to put personal safety and privacy on the same footing, because there cannot be one without the other. By asking you to postpone the vote slightly, the PPE Group is not questioning Parliament's demands or authority. It is asking for the ball to be put back into the Commission's, the Council's and the US's court for a very short period of time.
In fact, my group proposes that Parliament limit the time granted to the Council by demanding that the required information be supplied to us next month, not in May as requested by the Council. That would enable us to reach a definitive opinion in March. That is not unrealistic, especially as we learned yesterday evening that Commissioner Malmström was undertaking to propose a new negotiating mandate for the final agreement next week or by the next mini-session in Brussels, which is to say in 10 days' time. A new mandate in February and Parliament's vote in March, that is what we are proposing.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would like to support the EPP's proposal for postponement on the vote. I believe that this is a sensible and rational course of action; the House may have new powers but we must exercise them in a measured and responsible way. The Council has tried to appease Parliament, perhaps not sufficiently yet, but they have also apologised for their mistakes during this process. So I think we should now take some time to cooperate and work together on moving forwards and towards a new long-term agreement as well. I believe it is in the best interests of the House's reputation, the future of our international agreements and the security of Europe that we now give ourselves this time.
rapporteur. - Mr President, my recommendation is to vote against postponement as conditions for postponement have not been met by the Council. This House cannot keep falling for fake promises; the ball was in the Council's court but it failed to act appropriately and effectively. The Council has known about this problem for over two years and has done nothing in that time to deal with it. By withholding our consent on the interim agreement the security of European citizens is not being compromised. Targeted transatlantic data exchange will remain possible; the rule of law is crucially important though currently our laws are being broken and under this agreement with its provisional application they would continue to be broken. Parliament should not be complicit in this.
The Commission is committed to a very ambitious timetable. I would like to confirm what Mr Daul said - that the Commission will adopt the mandate for a new long-term agreement on 24 February if you agree to postpone the vote. I am ready to come to you personally the same day to present the mandate. The Council will get it the day after in Brussels in order to consider it. I am sure that the Spanish Presidency will do everything they can to agree to the mandate as soon as possible. The Commission will then immediately launch negotiations with the US to try to conclude them as soon as possible.
(DE) Mr President, I have a supplementary question for the Commission, that is, Mrs Malmström: Am I correct in my understanding, Mrs Malmström, that, in your capacity as Commissioner, you support the postponement of the vote of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)? May I ask why you did not support these requests during your six-month stint as the Swedish Presidency's Europe Minister? If you had, we would not have had to discuss the postponement today.
As you know, media freedom is one of the foundations of a democratic society. It certainly includes the right to receive information from multiple pluralistic sources. Recently there have been attacks on media freedom by President Hugo Chávez. In August last year he ordered the closure of 34 radio stations through a refusal to renew their licences. This January President Chávez ordered off the air RCTV International and five other cable and satellite TV channels who failed to broadcast his official speech. Furthermore he has described using Twitter and the Internet to pass on anti-government information as terrorist activities. We protest against the death of two Venezuelan students who protested against this shutting-down of the free media...
In a joint motion for a resolution with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, my group reiterates its unequivocal support for freedom of expression and plurality. I am surprised, however, at the very varied view that the PPE Group has of that freedom of expression. Was it not you who voted against the resolution on the freedom of the press in Italy in Berlusconi's defence? If you want to make fools of yourselves today, be my guest. There will be plenty of you at voting time, make the most of it.
There are many flagrant cases of violations of human rights in Latin America. Let us also be more consistent. Do we want to discuss human rights in Latin America? Then let us talk about Colombia and Honduras. How is it that those issues never come to be discussed here in plenary? Why do we always have this problem and yet in a case like today's, which is merely an administrative issue, we get this kind of presence and support? This is unacceptable. It is unacceptable because, I insist, we are losing all credibility and all legitimacy to be able to express an opinion on these types of cases.
author. - Mr President, let me first emphasise the utter hypocrisy of the right-wing groups in this Parliament which condemned the Venezuelan government for the temporary withdrawal of broadcasting facilities for Radio Caracas Television (RCTV) and pretend to be champions of the freedom of the press. These are the same groups that stand for a system in Europe where the vast majority of the media is controlled by billionaires and major private corporations, who use this control on the one hand to reap massive profits for themselves and on the other hand to spew out pro-capitalist propaganda, pro-market and pro-neoliberal propaganda; who, in the context of the present economic crisis, vilify and abuse public--sector workers, for example, relentlessly pushing an agenda that it is working-class people who must pay for the crisis, and vilify without end those working class organisations that dare to disagree.
Bringing the issue of RCTV into the human rights emergency resolution today is a major abuse of that procedure. By the way, most of the media outlets in Venezuela are in private ownership, actually, including powerful media corporations which conspired to overthrow Hugo Chávez in 2002, who happens to have been elected and re-elected many times by the people of Venezuela. The reality is that the EPP in this Parliament has the same agenda as the coup conspirators: they want to overthrow Hugo Chávez's government because this government has not carried out the bold dictates of world capitalism implementing privatisation and deregulation across the board, and they want no opposition to the neoliberal agenda. Yes, the working class in Latin America in general rise up in opposition. No, I am not without some sharp criticisms of the Venezuelan government.
Despite massive support from the majority of the Venezuelan people, Hugo Chávez, in fact, has not decisively broken with capitalism and led a movement to genuine democratic socialism. There is a trend towards bureaucratism in certain senses. Finally, co-thinkers of mine on the ground, in the Socialismo Revolucionário Group for example, are fighting these trends and fighting for workers' rights and genuine socialism, which means, by the way, that the media would not be controlled either by capitalist interests or by bureaucratic interest but open democratically to all sectors of society.
Columbia is a strategic partner of ours. Let us support and be with Columbia at this time, when the country is being attacked so strongly by Chávez, and is being induced, deceitfully or provocatively, to intensify the conflict in the region. This is our obligation, and if those attacks and the provocation intensify, the European Union and the European Parliament will be obliged to stand by Columbia, to be with Columbia and to support Columbia in a conflict with Venezuela which, I fear, may soon begin.
Mr President, it is always the same: for a better tomorrow, to abolish inequalities, to liberate the people from oppressors and tyrants, to end poverty and destitution, to use the country's wealth for the good of the nation - someone takes power. This is the objective of every revolution, and also of those people who, using the mechanisms of democracy, take up the position they dream of, such as president, only the next day to throw away their slogans about liberty, democracy and society. From that moment on, they are guided by only one motto: 'once we have power we will never give it up'. Dictators achieve this objective using the same methods: censorship, secret police, prison for those who think differently, breaking up and dividing opposition forces and complete control of the media. A kind of founding charter, a symbol of exactly that kind of thinking in the 20th century was, for example, Lenin's suppression of the uprising of the heroic Kronstadt sailors. This diagnosis is also true, today, for Venezuela. Media freedoms are of essential significance for democracy and respect for fundamental values. The European Commission should take appropriate action.
(DE) Mr President, we know that Venezuela is one of the most oil-rich countries in the world. We also know that this country has enormous hydroelectric power potential. Nonetheless, as we all know, the population of Venezuela is suffering the consequences of years of mismanagement. For decades, this country has not been able to invest its oil revenues in sustainable development or in developing infrastructure. The pegging of the national currency to the US dollar was probably another counterproductive move. Recently, President Chávez has tried to overcome this problem by depreciating the currency and getting public debt under control. However, the nationalisation of banks, expropriation and the temporary closure of food shops will probably not be sufficient to ward off the threat of runaway inflation for long.
President Chávez is pursuing a dirigistic economic policy, a centrally planned economy similar to those of other authoritarian regimes, which is undoubtedly and inevitably doomed to failure. The situation is likely to worsen even further, which will probably happen if food producers, who have been forced to produce food at fixed, non-market prices for years, attempt to rise up in protest at some point, wherever possible. I must also express my criticism of the fact that, in this precarious situation in which Venezuelans suffer from power cuts, water shortages and a deplorable economy, President Chávez has bought over USD 70 million worth of arms for the National Guard. This does not augur well, in particular in the context of the continued protests following the closure of a broadcaster critical of the government, in which students and opposition members have time and again clashed violently with the security forces.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised that, in this House, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) stands accused of forcing this topic, which, although urgent, is probably not to the liking of any member of the Left majority of this House, onto the agenda. I doubt that they constitute a majority in this House. I simply had to ask that question. Like all the other groups, our group is also perfectly entitled to raise this matter. Even though Mr Chávez, who is currently in power, might be some kind of chum of yours or of the previous Spanish Presidency-in-Office, we still simply have to ask what action is being taken in this regard.
I am quite amazed that somebody like Mr Chávez can possibly say things like 'Twitter is a terrorist system'. I am sorry, but anyone in this day and age who describes Twitter as a terrorist system is living in another world, back in the stone age. Let me tell you this, as well: We, the PPE Group, will not be cowed by this accusation. We denounce violations of human rights everywhere. I personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press. On that score, let me just say that Venezuelan journalists are spoon-fed and dictated to and that judges are thrown into jail if they release someone who has been wrongly arrested. As Europeans, we must have the courage to speak out against such practices.
Yet the fact that Chávez considers Twitter and text messaging as acts of terrorism shows us that he considers people and the free flow of their ideas and opposition as his enemy. I am a user of Twitter and text messaging, I have to confess, but in Europe, thankfully, we consider free expression a fundamental and universal right, including on the Internet. Limiting digital avenues to expression, information and the exchange of ideas is testimony to the Venezuelan government's fear of its citizens and their call for an end to violence and oppression.
Yet, still, this House has its fair share of Chávez apologists, like Mr Higgins: perhaps because Chávez reflects their virulent anti-Americanism and their resentment of the success of President Uribe in neighbouring Columbia. It is lamentable that other political groups on the Left refuse to join with us in the political mainstream of the House in condemning the increasingly arbitrary and serious affronts to basic freedoms perpetrated by the Chávez regime. His response to a TV station critical of his rule was simply to take it off the air.
(RO) In my view, Hugo Chávez has adopted all the worst possible aspects of totalitarian socialism from the last century. I do not mean by this his attitude towards foreign investments which is also, of course, a major issue for as long as it is completely random. However, I do mean his attitude to freedom of the press and what is represented by pluralism, because Hugo Chávez is attempting to copy pluralism, simply by closing down radio stations which refuse to broadcast his long-winded speeches and creating public stations to simulate pluralism. Copying pluralism is not the same as accepting pluralism because democracy cannot operate on the basis of a caricature of pluralism.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to endorse the view presented here, on behalf of my group, by Mrs De Keyser. There is no doubt that there must be no toleration for violation of media freedoms. We are, certainly, seeing disturbing events in Venezuela. I think, however, that we should be very careful about forming unequivocal, categorical and final judgments. In my opinion, we should be given an answer to a fundamental question: the stations which were closed down - were they all closed down for political reasons, or were some of them closed down because, in fact, they did not meet legal requirements? I think an answer here, and understanding what is pure politics and what is legal fact, would have great significance for the position of our House.
The Venezuelans are also having to endure completely unnecessary power and water cuts in what is Latin America's most energyrich country. The closure of radio and television channels and the violent suppression of student demonstrations speak of a totalitarian regime. Why, therefore, should we not react? As the media have to operate according to the law, they should not be closed down unless the authorities are left with no other option, and only after all the legal means available have been used. Accused people must also be given the chance to defend themselves and appeal against their convictions.
I know that for some people freedom must be defended in certain ways and in certain places. However, I also know that for some people, true freedom, their own freedom, is one that is imposed by certain dictators whom they defend and in some cases they even encourage and not the freedom of people like us who defend this word to its fullest extent, who believe in free media and who believe that land cannot be taken by decree. You should ask the thousands of people from the Canary Islands who have been subjected to this situation in Venezuela.
For example, in November 2009, the special rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Council argued that the proposed special law against media crimes in Venezuela - I quote - 'would involve serious violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and would curtail press freedom in the country if it is adopted in its current form'. The rapporteur also called on Venezuela to fully respect Articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Venezuela is a party and which guarantees the right to freedom of opinion and expression.
You might also recall that, in 2009, the European Union issued a declaration concerning those problems, because for us freedom of expression and free access to information are issues that are part of the dialogue that we have with the Venezuelan authorities. We deeply deplore that two protesters died and several persons were injured, including members of the security forces and protestors. We share the assessment of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which has expressed its deep concern over the serious violent incidents which occurred in the demonstrations both for and against the government of President Chávez and which has urged the Venezuelan government to control demonstrations - I quote - 'within the framework of respect for human rights according to inter-American standards'.
In the context of the dialogue which the EU is leading with the Venezuelan authorities, we have always stressed the importance of fully respecting international obligations and commitments on human rights, including freedom of expression and the press as a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law. As you know, this principle is enshrined in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights that is now part of our treaties. This puts a specific emphasis on freedom of expression and respect for pluralism in the media, in Europe and also in our international relations.
in writing. - I support this resolution, for I am concerned with the undemocratic measures taken by the government in Venezuela, specifically those curtailing the rights to free press, expression and assembly, as well as with the high level of corruption, as perceived by the people of Venezuela. Control of the media and of different opinions is typical for totalitarian regimes. As reported by human rights groups, in January 2010, the Chávez government threatened to take action against cable providers that aired channels that did not comply with the government requirement to interrupt regular broadcasting in order to broadcast presidential speeches. As a result, the country's cable providers stopped broadcasting seven channels. In 2009, Chávez forced stations to transmit live 141 speeches, including one that lasted seven hours and 34 minutes. As regards corruption, the government should fully and effectively implement the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the other relevant instruments, and take seriously Venezuelans' concerns about corruption - an indicator of good governance in any country.
The illegal nominations of questionable political personalities, the widespread human rights violations and the harassment and arbitrary arrest of parliamentarians, religious leaders and civilians have upset the international community and led it to impose sanctions. Madagascar's membership of the Southern Africa Development Community and the African Union has been frozen. The United States are refusing it the advantages of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The donors of the International Monetary Fund have reduced their budget by 50%, the UN will examine the situation of this country on 15 February and the European Union has, I believe, suspended its development aid, while maintaining its humanitarian aid.
The situation is therefore tragic, catastrophic, for a population living on less than a dollar a day. We are terribly concerned about this situation and this joint emergency motion for a resolution is proof of our concern. We support the mediation efforts being made by Joaquim Chissano, the former president of the Republic of Mozambique, and urge the four political groups to return to the negotiating table. There can be no other solution. We are also calling on the African Union and the Southern African Development Community to resume contact in order to bring the transitional process to a proper conclusion and we call on the Commission to report to us on the consultation process under way with Madagascar under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
The African Union, the European Union, the UN, neighbouring countries, the Contact Group and, last but not least, France, have all been called upon to play their part in ensuring that the four (at a minimum) different political movements that there are in Madagascar can find common ground, that Madagascar does not become a failing state, that it does not drift further towards catastrophe and that, instead, it finds a peaceful and negotiated solution. However, this will only be possible as long as nobody tries to establish a dictatorship there, nobody withdraws from the peace process and all the parties return to the negotiating table, or otherwise this wonderful, but ravaged, country will have no future.
author. - Mr President, if the African Union aspires to have anything like the authority and respect accorded to the EU in international affairs, then Madagascar is surely a case in which the AU should act decisively. Instead we have seen the usual vacillation and tepid diplomacy following the fall of President Marc Ravalomanana, which is sadly reminiscent of the situation in Zimbabwe. It is time for the African Union to accept its responsibilities with regard to Madagascar, where political tension and chaos have been endemic for some time. If the AU cannot bring itself to sort out this mess, then it is reasonably fair to ask why the EU should do so.
However, we should continue to remain engaged with Madagascar in order to facilitate a smooth return to democratic government and to promote reconciliation. It is vital that those politicians and military officers who have been cited and carried out human rights abuses should be brought to justice. Targeted sanctions against the illegitimate regime of Andry Rajoelina also offer an effective way to punish those who perpetrate the ongoing instability without harming the overwhelming majority of the Malagasy people, who must be heartedly sick of the tensions and sporadic violence in their beautiful country.
(DE) Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that all the groups have endorsed this motion for a resolution. That is as it should be, because this topic is very important. In contrast to the previous speakers, I would like to say that we must ensure that we do not merely promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press in this country, but that we also actively demand them, now that we are examining ways that we could help things proceed towards a, hopefully, peaceful election. We have to ensure that we, as Europeans, establish freedom of the press in all areas, with all the financial assistance that is needed to make that possible. We also have to provide full support and endeavour to act together to provide financial assistance, within the scope of the agreements which we have with this country.
(DE) Mr President, on the subject of Madagascar, it is good that we can report that it is not just the European Union that is concerned about this country's compliance with Article 96 of The Cotonou Agreement, but that the African Union and SADC, as regional organisations, have also taken the position that another coup d'état in Africa is unacceptable. For the African Union and for the regional organisations, it is a relatively new thing, not only to make these kinds of decisions, but also to implement them and to take action.
The Burmese government has promised a democratic transition in seven stages, ultimately leading up to elections. However, if these elections are held in keeping with a constitution drawn up by the army, as would appear to be the case, the only thing they will do will be to legitimise five decades of military regime and give the army 25% of the parliamentary seats. We call on the international community, including China, India and Russia, to continue to combine their efforts and exert pressure on the Burmese government, both so that it stops the serious human rights violations committed in this country and so that the democratic transition announced does not turn into a political farce.
Mr President, the announcement, in any country, of the first elections to be held for 20 years usually fills us with optimism. It awakens hope for the introduction of change and for democratisation. Unfortunately, probably not many of us, and not many of the residents of Burma, believe the elections which are to take place there at the end of this year will be democratic and honest, or will bring about real change. The Burmese regime is a problem we have struggled with for years. In our resolution, we condemn numerous violations of human rights and civil liberties, which are everyday events in Burma. We still do not know what to say to the people of Burma about how to end the regime's ruthless deeds. In my opinion, only joint action can bring results. Joint - whom do I have in mind? Who should take action? Neighbouring countries? The countries which have a lot of trade and exchange with the regime, indirectly financing it, in other words Russia and China? The European Union of course, the United States and the UN - with this group of partners we can bring about change.
Several tens of thousands - I should say hundreds of thousands - of Burmese immigrants are living in Thailand, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia in conditions which are often more than precarious and open to trafficking. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced against their will. In this sort of situation, journalists are especially at risk. At least 14 journalists are currently in prison and I should like here to highlight the case of Hla Hla Win, a young 25-year-old journalist, who has been sentenced to 27 years in prison for illegally importing a motorcycle because she dared to visit a Buddhist monastery.
Today, we are going once again to energetically condemn the systematic human rights violations in Burma and invite the Burmese government to dialogue and to immediately put an end to the practice of recruiting child soldiers. We are once again going to ask the Chinese, Indian and Russian governments to exert their influence. However, Commissioner, I urge you to be our spokesperson to the Commission and the Council, so that the European Union maintains restrictive measures towards the Burmese government because, apart from words, we do not have the slightest tangible proof of democratic debate. We call on you to evaluate the efficacy of measures taken and to do everything to ensure that the civilian population ...
author. - Mr President, I have lost count of the number of times over the years in this House that we have debated the serious and worsening human rights situation in Burma, but, if we are ever tempted to soften our rhetoric against the brutal military junta, we only have to look around our own Parliament to remember why we need to maintain and increase the pressure on the generals. I am referring, of course, to Aung san Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and Nobel laureate, whose picture is displayed prominently on Parliament's premises in both Brussels and Strasbourg. She has consistently been denied a voice, as have her supporters. So the least we can do is speak up for them from here and promise them our unswerving support in their mission to bring about permanent democratic change in Burma.
It is therefore necessary to first consider that there must be a suitable environment for elections to be able to take place. Any dialogue which may enable us to improve the situation will be welcomed, but on the basis that these persons are unconditionally released and a guarantee is in place for refugees to be able to return. In this regard, I must make an explicit appeal to the Commission. The reduction in funds which are destined for this area and for these refugees is of great concern. There are urgent needs. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who require our help. Hence, I believe that it would be a good idea to avoid cutting these budgets.
on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the human rights situation in Burma has deteriorated dramatically: political repression accompanied by military and sexual violence, children systematically being recruited as soldiers, 2 000 political prisoners. The first, allegedly free, elections in the autumn of this year are a total farce. The opposition parties are rightly going to boycott them. What is particularly concerning is the position of the Rohingyas, more than 200 000 of whom live in refugee camps. Many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh and have been brutally persecuted en route.
I very much welcome Bangladesh's willingness to allow our EP Delegation to South Asia into the country on a fact-finding mission. We are flying to Dhaka tomorrow, in order to gather first-hand information about the situation in Cox's Bazar and the Bandarban region. However, it is already clear that, in order to survive, the persecuted Rohingyas need comprehensive international protection. The European Union must persist in its denouncement of the Burmese government's behaviour, until such time as signs of progress in the direction of democracy finally begin to appear.
I would like to believe that following today's debates the voice of the European Parliament and the European Union will have a greater effect. Why? Because here for the first time we are talking human rights in the world now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon and the posts that go with it - among others, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, approved by Parliament. Now the European Union has a more effective opportunity to have a direct influence both on the situation in Burma and on the situation in other countries where rights are violated.
Mr President, to date, the appeals of the international community for human rights to be observed in Burma have, in fact, produced no result at all. There are still thousands of political prisoners in Burmese prisons, and the army continues to commit assassinations, use torture and make arrests. The leader of the Burmese opposition, Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest for many years, and has also received a three-year prison sentence. This is how the junta wants to prevent her from standing in the coming elections.
Burma is also a leader on the disgraceful list of countries where there is frequent persecution of representatives of religious minorities, including Christians. In accordance with the ideas of the junta, the Karen people, who are Christians, are to disappear completely from Burmese territory. Last year, Karen refugees fleeing the repressions took refuge in Thailand. Today, in spite of international protests, the Thai government is preparing for the forced repatriation and mass deportation of over 4 000 Karens, who will then be exposed to further indignities. It is our obligation, here in the European Parliament, to call for the rights of religious minorities, including Christians throughout the world.
We also need to express our thanks to Thailand, which withdrew its worrying decision to return refugees to Burma. Last week I made contact several times with Thailand after it had announced its plans to return these people. Karen refugees were being threatened with forced labour, torture, possibly enforced conscription into the army, and the placing of land mines in the area which they had fled from. It was with a feeling of relief that I heard that Thailand had decided to abandon its plans to return the refugees, following talks with human rights organisations and the international community at the weekend. I hope that the EU, along with the rest of the international community, will be able to offer assistance to Thailand as soon as possible, and look for an alternative solution to the problem of the Karen refugees.
(PL) Mr President, if Burma has decided to hold parliamentary elections for the first time in 20 years, this may mean a step forward in the process of democratisation, if the elections, planned for this autumn, are honest. In other words, they must firstly be general, with every adult citizen being able to vote or stand for election, including Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and 2 000 other opposition activists who are currently in prison for political reasons. Secondly, the elections must also include the several million Burmese who, afraid of torture and death, have fled to Thailand, Bangladesh or India. It should be made possible for them to vote in their original place of residence. Thirdly, members of the Burmese army should not have a guarantee of 25% of the seats in parliament, because this strikes at a fundamental democratic mechanism and distorts the election results at the outset. Finally, the Burmese government must respect the rule of a secret ballot, and must allow the elections to be monitored by international observers and Burmese media.
(HU) The military junta has promised free, democratic elections for 2010. It is important for the international community and of course, the EU to continue to put pressure on the junta so that the democratic transition actually takes place. We also need to make sure that the numerous ethnic minorities living in Burma are appropriately represented at the elections. This may put an end to the recurring ethnic conflicts. China is probably best placed to stand up for Chinese minorities, but it would first have to appreciate its own minorities: the Tibetans and the Uighurs. The EU can only be credible and effective in exerting pressure if it makes sure that minority rights are respected in all its Member States. As long as there are language laws in the territory of the European Union, and I do not refer to Slovakia only, as long as the law of collective guilt is still being rekindled in the territory of the European Union in a manner which contradicts the facts of the Second World War, and as long as the mere existence of minorities, their mother tongues and their rights are being denied within the territory of the European Union, the European Union cannot be credible when it seeks to exert pressure, and it cannot be successful, either.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the dramatic deterioration in the human rights situation in Burma caused by the military junta is resulting in ever more brutal bloodshed. The persecution of religious groups, ethnic cleansing and expulsion, the taking of thousands of political prisoners and the torture, abduction and incarceration of political opponents of the regime are the order of the day. The new constitution, and now the pseudo-elections that are supposed to be taking place, will not, of course, improve the situation in any way.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as Members have very clearly underlined, serious human rights violations are continuing in Burma. The military government has not responded to international calls to stop those human rights infringements and it has not released political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. Pressure has increased on the Rohingya minority to force them to leave the country, and the deterioration of socioeconomic conditions continues. An estimated 80% of the population live in rural areas, and severe problems in agriculture and food production are developing.
By saying this, I make it very clear that the EU does not want to isolate Burma. We are, in fact, the biggest donors of humanitarian and related assistance to that country. The bulk of our assistance goes to the countryside - particularly to the delta - which is still recovering from cyclone Nargis. Assistance also goes to the refugee camps along the Thai border. We should also know that the report of the United Nations special rapporteur speaks a very clear language. We back the special United Nations rapporteur and are ready to help him.
But we also know that direct activities on human rights in Burma are hardly possible. For instance, the EU will not be invited to observe the elections, so we have to utilise indirect measures. Therefore, human rights are built into all our assistance programmes. In order to promote our values - human rights development, dialogue - we need to have a very clear message. Today the united Parliament had this very clear message, and I am sure it will be heard. I am also sure that we should not outsource our task of reminding Myanmar of its obligations to neighbouring countries. We have to remain committed ourselves. We have to engage directly on our human rights agenda with the authorities, and we will continue to do so.
Burma continues to experience a very troubling situation with regard to human rights, as the Burmese authorities have prioritised their grip on power over the survival of their citizens. I should like to express my solidarity with respect to the suffering of the Burmese people, oppressed as they are by a military junta that constantly infringes their human rights by means of forced labour, people trafficking, child labour and sexual violence. It is essential that political prisoners, including the head of the opposition and leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was honoured with the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, be released immediately so as to contribute to the promotion of free, just and transparent elections in 2010. For this reason, I urge the European Union to adopt a coherent strategy and develop relations with neighbouring countries, particularly with China and India, with a view to promoting transparent elections in Burma.
Because it is only natural for there to be concerns about one thing or another in connection with any legislative proposal, we have resolved the open questions by means of a compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs. I should make it clear that this compromise is ready for approval. Nevertheless, I do understand that it might make sense to enlarge the group that are in support of this report a bit more. If the efforts of Mr Schulz are aimed at increasing the number of supporters, then I have nothing against a postponement until the next plenary sitting in March. That is my personal opinion on the matter. It is not the opinion of the group, which expressly decided otherwise this morning. However, I think we should give the Socialists a chance to reach a conclusion so that they too can do something to help reduce bureaucracy and the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.
(DE) Mr President, I will be brief. In the last few days, two important nominations have been put forward: the first is the representative of the European Commission to the United States of America in Washington and the second is the Special Representative for Afghanistan. Both nominations are controversial and there are various discussions going on about both of them. I do not wish to go into the question of merit just now. I would simply like to ask, Mr President, that, before they take office, both of them appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs to enable us to have an intensive debate there, and I hope that the President of the Commission and the President of the Council will give this their full support with your help, Mr President.
(DE) Mr President, for its 60th birthday in 2005, the United Nations gave itself two new structures. The first was the Peacebuilding Commission and the second was the Human Rights Council. While the Peacebuilding Commission carries out its work fairly effectively and has largely met expectations, the same cannot be said, with the best will in the world, about the Human Rights Council. It has been said here - and expressed in the resolution - that a reform is sorely needed. The work of the Human Rights Council is too one-sided - my fellow Members have mentioned this - for example, Israel is discussed from a one-sided perspective. To be honest, I am not happy that the only major issue that the Presidency has highlighted here is the Goldstone report, which is certainly worth discussing, but it is not the main issue.
If Mr Howitt says that the election of Iran - if successful - would be a death blow to the Human Rights Council, then I would like to know what that means. I would like a uniform position to be taken on this by our Member States and also by the European External Action Service because I believe that, if things continue in this way, we will need to seriously consider putting the focus of our human rights work in the United Nations back onto the Third Committee, which at least has universal representation and greater legitimacy.
Mr President, this so-called Human Rights Council opposes everything that human rights are about, in particular, freedom of expression. It is outrageous and despicable that this Parliament should take this terrible Council seriously. Mr President, if this House really does believe in human rights, then it should condemn the steady stream of resolutions which seek to strangle freedom of expression, as well as flagrant human rights violations committed by the countries which make up the Human Rights Council. Mr President, in addition to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt, who are amongst the gravest violators of human rights in the world, now Iran, too, wants to become a member of the Human Rights Council. Well then, we just need North Korea to join the club and we will have pretty much all the rogue states happily sitting alongside each other.
The introduction of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, which is the most important innovation in relation to the now defunct UN Commission on Human Rights, was intended to resolve the relevant problems, the excessive politicisation and selective approach in handling cases of serious human rights violations. This mechanism is vital so that the Human Rights Council can fulfil its mandate in whatever way possible. However, it must be emphasised that the old demons have not disappeared entirely and excessive politicisation continues to affect the work of this body. On the other hand, we must say that the Universal Periodic Review mechanism is not sufficient to ensure effective protection for human rights.
(RO) I would like to talk about the situation in the Gaza Strip which, as you know, is a constant source of concern in terms of respect for human rights, especially after the deterioration in circumstances as a result of the clashes last winter. I do not believe that we can measure who has suffered more in this conflict. Military actions by both sides have meant that mainly civilians suffer, unfortunately. However, in the context of the situation on the ground, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between soldiers and civilians among Palestinians. On the other hand, the rocket attacks launched by Hamas have terrorised Israeli civilians.
I visited the area during the conflict and saw the problems and fears facing both sides. I believe that any attempt to pin the blame for the events which have occurred on just one side is at variance with the reality. The bloody clashes in the Gaza Strip and the tragic humanitarian consequences are a painful plea for concentrated action in all the hot spots around the globe, in particular, against the causes responsible for making defenceless civilians suffer, and for more extensive and effective involvement by international organisations, with a view to giving impetus to the dialogue for peace. This is an area where the European Union has not only the necessary capacity and credibility, but also the duty to take more robust action globally.
Mr President, one parliamentary priority is also to address an alarming situation where the Human Rights Council's activities have resulted in extreme politicisation. It is therefore of utmost importance that the EU member delegations should stand up for the establishment of criteria for becoming a member of the Human Rights Council. That applies especially to minimum requirements of cooperation with special procedures, and resisting the use of 'no action' motions which have prevented the adoption of resolutions on certain states who are keen to avoid criticisms of their human rights policies.
(RO) I would like to draw your attention during today's debate to the case of Israeli soldier Ghilad Shalit, who was kidnapped in Kerem Shalom in June 2006, aged just 19. Last week, I was part of the official European Parliament delegation in Israel and one of the meetings was with Ghilad Shalit's father, Noam Shalit. In spite of Articles 13, 23 and 126 of the Geneva Convention on the rights of prisoners of war, Ghilad, who also holds French citizenship, has not had his rights respected in terms of receiving visits from his family and the International Red Cross, receiving humane treatment and having the exact location where he is being held prisoner disclosed. I must emphasise that even Article 77 of the Goldstone Commission report, which is otherwise critical of Israel, recommends that Ghilad Shalit should enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Geneva Convention. On the other hand, Israel respects the rights of prisoners.
(HU) At the March session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the European Union must unequivocally state that the international community cannot keep silent about human rights violations, not only those occurring in developing countries but also the contraventions that may be observed in developed countries. The Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 1992, is equally binding on developing and developed countries, including EU Member States. The first paragraph of the Declaration's second article states that persons belonging to national minorities have the right to use their own language, in private and in public, without interference or any form of discrimination. At present, this article is often honoured in the breach in EU Member States as well. The EU can only be credible if it finds a solution that deals with human rights contraventions within European Union territories in a way that sets an example for the whole world.
(SV) Mr President, as regards our group's joint resolution on the UN Human Rights Council I am particularly pleased about paragraphs 6 and 25, in which we repeat the EU's strong support for country-specific resolutions. In those cases where human rights are systematically abused, country-specific resolutions are an incredibly important instrument, both in the Human Rights Council and in the UN General Assembly. In many cases where the government of a country has long failed to participate in dialogue or programmes to improve the situation in question, country-specific resolutions represent the only remaining action that the international community can take against these crimes.
It is not about naming and shaming, as some critics believe; neither is it the case that we in Europe enjoy poking our noses into other countries' internal affairs. It is quite simply a matter of signalling that we will not accept a regime's systematic abuses and oppression of its own people. It is about showing that we side with liberty, not with oppression. That is why it is important that the EU camp continues to defend the existence of country-specific resolutions within the UN system.
Mr President, the countries of the European Union should put their own houses in order before pointing their fingers at others. Many European Union members prosecute and imprison people for non-violent freedom of speech. In particular, they seek to make any opposition to immigration a criminal offence. Book-burning is alive and well. Political parties are banned, as in Belgium, or their ban is sought on invented evidence, as in Germany, or a backdoor ban is sought, as in the United Kingdom, where my own party has been banned, by a court order sought by the government, from accepting new members for an indefinite period.
In this respect, we believe that participation in the United Nations Human Rights Council, including support for the existence of the Council, is a position that must be upheld by the European Union. The European Union has always advocated that a Human Rights Council should be established to replace the former Commission, as I said before. Furthermore, it has believed that it should be an instrument that can adequately deal with human rights situations worldwide, situations which require the United Nations and its members to take action, adopt a position or make the corresponding declaration.
In fact, the Presidency of the European Union, the Presidency of the Council, has always systematically taken part in the discussions at the various part-sessions of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the European Union, and this will continue to be the case. The Presidency of the Council of the Union will take part in the next part-session of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the Council of the Union. Naturally, this is perfectly compatible with the declarations and positions of each of the Member States of the Union and of the European Commission, as another institution of the Union.
I therefore would like to say that we are in favour of the existence of this body, and in favour of drawing on all of its potential, which, in some cases, is achieved, and in other cases is not: obviously, there are certain situations in which, as a result of the votes that take place, the European Union and its Member States do not achieve all their objectives. There are really positive cases, for example, the position on Somalia: there are violations of human rights in that region. There are other cases in which the objectives have not been achieved, but the positives always outweigh the negatives.
Regarding the question of the candidacy, we first have to say that this is a matter that is currently still one of national competence (the position regarding candidacies of countries to join the Human Rights Council). In any case, the matter of the human rights situation in Iran and the human rights violations, and therefore the question as to whether or not Iran's candidacy for the Human Rights Council will be accepted, must be managed carefully in order not to cause the opposite of the desired effect. We therefore understand that the European Union, here, must try to have the most coordinated position possible (which is what is happening at the moment), while respecting national competence and, as I said, exercising caution.
In short, Mr President, we consider the Human Rights Council to be a place where we must defend the European Union's position, and we think it is the right place to do so. Furthermore, our commitment to it has always been to ensure that it does not cause the universal movement defending human rights to take steps backwards, to regress, especially in terms of humanity's achievement, which is considering human rights to be a universal value, a universal value that should be defended over and above borders, traditions and diversity, because it is something that is linked to the very essence of human beings.
On the very sad case of the loss of human life in Cuba, the death of Mr Orlando Zapata, I would like to express the condolences of the Commission to his family and strongly condemn the continuous imprisonment of more than 200 political dissidents in Cuba as well as other expressions of disrespect for fundamental human rights. The Commission calls upon Cuba to change its policy and to live up to its obligations under international law. We will continue to address the human rights issue in the dialogue with Cuba, with the authorities there, and we will use this dialogue as a vehicle to press the issue of human rights.
I have many reservations about the UNHCR's overall credibility. In any case, I hope that the presence of a delegation from the Subcommittee on Human Rights at the next session of the Council will provide the European institutions with an opportunity to raise the urgent issue of Christianophobia. We are well aware that we do not need to turn back the clock to find serious cases of anti-Christian persecution: we are not in fact talking about the past, but about the present, and unfortunately, in all likelihood, also about the future, because, every day, from every corner of the globe, we receive worrying, tragic news of Christian believers being attacked, discriminated against and killed. We also know that the issue is a sensitive one, and that although it has not been addressed properly up to now, this has happened not only because of the diplomatic balance that the participants have to maintain in meetings such as the UNHCR, but obviously also because of the anti-Christian policy pursued by countries which, whilst they are not exactly enemies of Christianity, do at least traditionally tolerate anti-Christian acts.
in writing. - I support this resolution which calls, inter alia, on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Member States to work towards a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the Goldstone report and demands the implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law, including alleged war crimes, and urges all sides to conduct investigations that meet international standards of independence, impartiality, transparency, promptness and effectiveness, in line with United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/64/L.11. It further stresses that respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law by all parties and under all circumstances is an essential precondition for achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The resolution also calls on the EU High Representative and Member States to actively monitor the implementation of recommendations included in the Goldstone report by means of consultation of EU external missions and NGOs in the field and calls for the recommendations and related observations to be included in EU dialogues with all parties, as well as EU positions in multilateral fora.
In Geneva, the Swedish Presidency of the Council established the European Union's position in the following way: firstly, the European Union considers the report to be serious, as it contains reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including deliberate attacks on civilians. Secondly, the European Union stresses the importance of adequate and credible investigations being conducted into the possible violations of international law by the parties to the conflict, in line with international legislation and therefore ensuring that the mission directs its recommendations to both the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The European Union confirmed its constructive position with regard to the Goldstone report when, in the debate of the United Nations Security Council on 27 January, just one month ago, it highlighted the importance of conducting adequate and credible investigations into the possible violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. I can inform you that, subsequently, on 4 February 2010, a few days ago, the Secretary-General of the United Nations published a report on the application of the United Nations General Assembly's Goldstone Resolution.
The EU will strive to ensure that the appropriate follow-up is given at the Human Rights Council meeting in March and to engage at an early stage in the preparation of a consensual resolution. In this context, I would like to state here that on 18 February, the Palestinian Delegation tabled a draft General Assembly resolution further to the United Nations' Secretary-General's report as a follow-up to the Goldstone report. The Palestinian side indicated that it is their intention to seek General Assembly action on the resolution on Friday, 26 February, to reiterate the main points of the General Assembly resolution 64/10 of 5 November 2009, and to ask the United Nations' Secretary-General to report again in five months. As we sit in this room, Member States and the Commission are in intensive consultations on this issue with the aim of reaching a common position on this resolution.
Mr President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, I believe that a credible investigation into the violations of international humanitarian law is important and that this is what we must focus on. The conclusion needs to be examined, but this applies equally to both parties involved, including to those waging asymmetrical war by firing on Sderot and other towns from a densely populated area, thereby determining the battlefield. This is being investigated fairly and no one-sided conclusions will be drawn in this regard.
However, I would also like to point out that it is right to call for an international investigation, although not everything can be investigated within the framework of the Goldstone report. This report is intended to deal solely with the occupied territories. It has been pointed out that not a single Member State of the European Union voted in favour of the report in the Human Rights Council. Some abstained, others voted against it and others - such as the United Kingdom and France - refused to take part in the vote at all. We should also take this into account, as the resolution was carried by such 'representatives of human rights and democracy' as Cuba, Nigeria and China. We ought to bear this in mind when evaluating this matter. We need to stand up for human rights, but not on the basis of this report in order to wage political war against one of the sides.
However, there has been the Goldstone report. Mr Brok, what is the difference between the Goldstone report and the resolution that followed? The Goldstone report, this brave report that simply demands that justice be done, is that too much to ask? The pressure today to bring down this report and the discrediting of Judge Goldstone is unbelievable. His name is being dragged through the mud; he is being called an anti-Semite, even though Israel is not the only one to have the finger pointed at it in the Goldstone report. Fatah and Hamas are not spared criticism.
We want independent inquiries that are in keeping with international standards, not military tribunals judging their own soldiers. Mr Lieberman, I will also say that you are not welcome, not because you represent Israel, but because your racist and xenophobic positions are incompatible with European values. No democratic state can dare to break international law without having to justify its actions. This Parliament will not allow itself to be intimidated. It will simply continue to demand that justice be done, that light be shed on the tragedy of Gaza, not in a fierce way, but in a determined way. Today, I implore the Council and the Commission simply to abide by that. Light and justice, nothing else.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Goldstone report tries to fulfil the mandate it was given. That mandate is, or was, the following: 'To investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.' And that is exactly what the Goldstone report has done - although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female colleagues.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, let me say how delighted I am that we are finally discussing the Goldstone report in plenary, because it is a vitally important issue, and to date, the EU has been shamefully absent in these issues. It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report. The Commission says it is taking it very seriously, but that is not good enough: we want an explicit endorsement. The Presidency says that it backs it: well, it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well.
The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field, because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously. In Israel, the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police, severely compromising the independence of the findings, and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel. In the light of these failures, it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment.
I stress that this report is completely unbalanced. It attempts, in fact, to absolve the terrorist activity of Hamas. The report does not state the fundamental fact that, in the eight years before Israel, in its own defence, took action in the Gaza Strip, thousands of rockets were fired at innocent Israeli citizens. Every country has the right to defend itself against terrorists. Israel, too, has that right. It should also be said that 150 criminal investigations of the actions of particular Israeli soldiers are currently under way in Israel. In Israel, there is a free parliament, and there is a free press which often criticises its own government and its own armed forces. None of these features is to be found, unfortunately, on the terrorist side.
While certain parties are trying to undermine the report, we call on the Member States of the European Union to stand up for the principles that govern international law and the European Union and to support the debate of the report at the UN General Assembly and its notification to the Security Council with a view to its ultimate ratification and for measures to be taken. The report should be sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for examination. If the European Union is truly interested in resolving the Palestinian problem, then it should stop tolerating these crimes, because tolerance translates into encouragement and complicity.
Mr President, the available documentation about the Gaza operation leaves us in no doubt about the answer to that. Hamas deliberately exposed Palestinian citizens to an acute threat of war, even in places likes mosques. In contrast, just consider the intentions and actions of the Israelis, consider the protection of the lives and property of Jewish citizens against Hamas's terrorist rocket attacks, which have been going on for years, as well as Israel's real concern for Palestinian lives. Look at all the precautions they took during the operation.
The report makes no mention of the twelve thousand rockets fired on Israel from Gaza, which posed a very serious threat to the local population. Israel was exercising its right of self-defence. There is not a single word in the report about Hamas, nor about the fact that they used their citizens as a human shield or that they used civilian buildings in which to store arms and from which to launch rockets. Not a word about that. Not a word about the fact that the Hamas police force was once part of a military organisation which waged an armed struggle against Israel.
So let us not try to rubbish this report. Let us act on it. With others in this debate, I have personally spoken with representatives of the Israeli Government, representatives of the Palestinian Authority and, in Gaza itself, representatives of the commission set up by the de facto authority, to plead with them to cooperate with Goldstone and to undertake their own credible and independent investigations to bring to account those responsible for violations. I spoke with the US Assistant Secretary of State, Michael Posner, when he was here, to encourage Israel to do the same.
As it happens, I do not think that the Goldstone report is constructive in this regard. Furthermore - and it is worth recalling because it is rare - this was the conclusion reached by all the European countries, none of which have supported it in front of the worthy prosecutors and great defenders of freedoms and of human rights that are China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Cuba, to cite just a few examples. The report is much debated, it is biased and, whether we like it or not, it will not help us move forward.
(DE) Mr President, I am pleased that the European Parliament has succeeded in producing a resolution on the Goldstone report that has fairly broad support without simply transferring the conflict in the Middle East to Brussels. If we want to retain the chance of lasting peace, we must appeal to what unifies all parties involved, instead of - as some are doing here - emphasising the sources of division. The source of unification is the applicability of international law, in particular, with regard to human rights, throughout the world.
However, just as the parties to the conflict must allow and support an independent investigation, the international community must avoid making a one-sided judgment. Therefore, we also need to make it absolutely clear that the one-sided demonising of Israel is not only inappropriate in this debate, but it is inappropriate in general. Those powers that are working to call into question the legitimisation of the State of Israel must be clearly repudiated by us in Europe. Instead, the powers in Israel that are fighting with us for peace, tolerance and human rights in the Middle East must be strengthened. It therefore needs to be made clear here and now that we find the obstruction of the NGOs in Israel by government representatives like the Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, unacceptable. This policy is harmful to the people of Israel and therefore to peace in the Middle East.
(DE) Mr President, Israel's right to existence, the protection of its people and the efforts to promote as close cooperation with Israel as possible are, for me, as a German and a left-wing politician, political givens. However, I find it unacceptable that, for years now, 1.5 million Palestinians have been placed in the largest open-air prison in the world as hostages of a misconceived policy. Anyone who is aware that more than 44% of children under the age of 14 live in the Gaza Strip will realise what a dangerous legacy this policy has created for the future. Clearly, the 2008 war and the inhumane policy towards civilians are intended to be forgotten. For that reason, we call for an investigation and for atonement.
I have heard a lot of criticism here about Mr Goldstone's report. I know Mr Goldstone from when he was a great conciliator, carrying out and heading up many investigations in South Africa. In my opinion, Mr Goldstone is the prime example of someone who can lay the facts on the table in order to bring conciliation closer. Unfortunately, the way in which this report has been received suggests that no conciliation has come about and instead there appears to have been even greater polarisation. This is why the report has simply been ignored.
(CS) It is always deceptive to compare numbers which conceal the fate of individual human beings. Operation Cast Lead left more than a thousand victims among the inhabitants of Gaza, compared to thirteen victims among the Israeli armed forces. Do we need to know any more in order to conclude who is the guilty party and who is the victim in this war? I believe we most definitely do. For example, the fact that after 2006, thousands of rockets were fired against civilian populations in Israeli towns from the Gaza strip, and these were launched from densely populated areas and quite clearly from public buildings as well. We should ask further questions. How can a state defend its citizens in such a situation? Is it possible to fight with an army against terrorists who use civilians as human shields? If so, is it possible to avoid civilians becoming victims? What did the international community do to prevent this form of terrorism? Are there not intentionally varying standards in the area of adherence to human rights? Finding an answer to these serious questions is a challenging task for the common foreign policy of the EU. The aim of the policy should be to assist dialogue, build trust and seek patiently for a sustainable peaceful solution for the Middle East as a whole. An open-minded enquiry into all of the circumstances accompanying and also preceding the conflict in Gaza might be a step in the right direction.
(NL) This report is one-sided. It levels a great deal of criticism at Israel because, amongst other reasons, it fired on economic and civilian targets. However, Hamas misused these facilities. Unfortunately, Mr Goldstone has not seen fit to investigate whether this actually was the case. Mr Goldstone has therefore failed to investigate what Hamas did wrong and consequently rapped Israel over the knuckles. That inspires no confidence in this report, because there are other sources which suggest that Hamas did indeed entrench itself in hospitals, ambulances and civilian buildings.
(DA) Mr President, this matter - this report - is a fundamentally embarrassing chapter in the history of the UN. Who can, in all decency, discuss the issue of the war in Gaza without also including the thousands of Qassam rockets that rained down over the peaceful citizens of Israel for eight years? Who can, in all decency, discuss this issue without mentioning the hundreds of tunnels that exist between Egypt and Gaza and other areas, through which weapons are smuggled in order to damage Jewish interests in Israel? Who can, in all decency, write a report like this without including the fact that Israel has a well-functioning legal system, whereas not one of the murderers in Palestine and not one of the terrorists in Palestine has ever been brought to account for his crimes? The answer to all three questions is Judge Goldstone. This is scandalous! It is embarrassing for the UN system, and by having this debate at all in this Parliament, we are making it an embarrassing affair for the EU, too.
I am quite shocked by the remarks that Mr De Rossa and Mrs De Keyser made here. I wonder just what report you have read. If you know, as you do, something about the civil war between Hamas and Fatah, and how much human life has been destroyed in it, then you will agree that we should intervene in the process whereby the Palestinians find leadership and a common voice, and start to build their own country, and not just destroy it, and Israeli democratic society too, by firing rockets at it.
It was clear from the start that a report emanating from the dubious Human Rights Council of the UN - and that, Mr Howitt, is what the leader of our group criticised, not the UN; I am afraid your rather petty party point was rather demeaning - would be a one-sided condemnation of Israel. While it makes far-reaching demands of Israel, it says little about Hamas. It does not call for an end to terrorism and attacks on Israel but merely asks so-called Palestinian armed groups to renounce attacks on Israeli civilians and to try and avoid harm to Palestinian civilians.
(DE) Mr President, neither party to the conflict has so far met the demands of the United Nations for a credible and independent investigation into the accusations of the Goldstone report. This is regrettable, particularly on Israel's part, because, however controversial the Goldstone report might be, any state that calls itself a democratic state based on the rule of law is obliged to allow such serious accusations to be subjected to an independent investigation. An internal military investigation by the Israeli army, which is itself under suspicion, is not sufficient.
If the EU takes its own principles of respect for human rights and international law seriously, it must increase the pressure on both sides, including in the context of its bilateral relations, and insist that the investigation that has been called for into possible violations of international and humanitarian law is carried out according to the principles of the rule of law. War crimes must be punished under international law, as has been said here many times. If necessary, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court will have to carry out the investigations on the basis of Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. However, irrespective of the Goldstone report, there is currently no reason to continue the siege on Gaza.
Hamas recently announced that it was ready for dialogue with the international community, including the EU and the US. I would like to make a strong appeal for us not to entertain such an idea until Hamas unambiguously recognises Israel's right to exist and renounces violence. We look with pity on the victims of this long-running conflict, but it is essential to have a reliable Palestinian partner for the peace negotiations, and that means a legitimate, trustworthy and responsible representative of the Palestinian people. Until that happens, it will be a waste of time to produce hundreds more pages of international recommendations.
(EL) Mr President, the Goldstone report hits the nail on the head. The policy of treating both sides on equal terms is not helping. A series of crimes has been carried out and is being carried out in Gaza. There is poverty, misery and blatant disrespect for the human rights of the Palestinian people. There are witnesses to this. There are reports by the Red Cross, the International Bank and the Council of Europe on crimes against the Palestinians, on financial impoverishment and on inhumane living conditions in Gaza.
(DE) Mr President, the Goldstone report describes human rights violations by both sides. Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many. However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response. During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly. The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water. The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated. However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers. Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel.
However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities. I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel - it does not justify that. It perhaps does not help any further, either. However, it is clear that, here in the European Parliament, we must demand respect for human rights and call on both sides to return to the peace process.
(FR) Mr President, in Israel, Judge Goldstone's work is demonised and completely discredited in the eyes of the public. At the same time, a violent smear campaign is being conducted against human rights defenders, notably the New Israel Fund, a foundation which funds the main Israeli organisations for the defence of human rights and, in particular, against its president, Naomi Chazan, a former Member of the Knesset, an academic and intellectual known for her commitment to the defence of women's rights and peace.
The Goldstone report relating to an extremely controversial situation which stirs up strong passions finds it difficult to obtain the consent of the parties involved when the clashes which occurred in December 2008 and January 2009 between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants in Gaza, an area dominated by Hamas, have caused suffering on both sides. Regardless of the parties' position on the Goldstone report, I hope that it will not be used as a pretext to stonewall discussions aimed at resolving the Palestinian problem in a peaceful way for good. In fact, the priority in the region is to restart the peace talks which will involve, as has been the case so far, both the European Union and the United States of America. The solutions which will be reached must ensure the State of Israel of its continued existence in the region and provide the Palestinians with the guarantee that they will be able to live with dignity in their own viable, democratic and independent state. The European Union must be prepared to assume greater responsibility in this process in order to establish normal relations between Israel and Palestine. I believe that we must remember the most important point made in the Goldstone report: nothing can justify the suffering of defenceless people, and dialogue is a preferable way of putting an end to this situation rather than confrontation and the use of force.
On 5 November 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Goldstone report and passed Resolution 64/10. These documents called on both Israel and the Palestinians to investigate, within three months, possible human rights violations during the Gaza conflict. Unfortunately, neither Israel nor the Palestinians have as yet complied with this request. This is a great shame, because the Goldstone report provides a very extensive list of the misdeeds and crimes of both sides. According to the report, during the three-week-long attacks, Israel committed major violations of international law. Civilians were attacked indiscriminately and houses were bombed. The use of phosphorus bombs, condemned by the international community, has also been mentioned. The Palestinians, in turn, used rockets and mortar shells to deliberately kill civilians, according to the report. The accusations are so serious that it is imperative that they be investigated, and quickly. As the UN Security Council has rejected the Goldstone report, it cannot be assumed that the recommendation it contains to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague will be followed. I therefore call on the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, on behalf of the EU, to apply a great deal of pressure to both parties to the conflict and ask them to review the crimes.
It seems the members of the mission had been expressing convictions on the conflict even before the mission began, and when they were in the Gaza Strip, they were accompanied by representatives of Hamas and witnesses were interviewed in their presence. Justice Goldstone did not show sufficient care when examining the evidence. It also seems unjust that the words of the Israeli authorities which are quoted in the report are considered unreliable, whereas the position of the Gaza authorities, such as Hamas, do not give rise to any doubt in the members of the mission.
However, the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund is subject to certain criteria being met. The most important prerequisite is the submission of an application for assistance by the Portuguese Government. May I remind you that the Regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund normally only permits mobilisation of the fund for large-scale disasters where the cost of the damage exceeds a threshold of 0.6% of the gross national income of the State affected. For Portugal, this currently means that the cost of the damage must exceed EUR 958 million. However, in exceptional circumstances, and if particular criteria are met, assistance may also be granted for smaller, 'regional' disasters, particularly if one of the outermost regions, like Madeira, is affected. As the Commission does not yet have sufficient information about the extent of the damage, it is still too early to say whether these conditions will be met.
The authorities in Portugal should now carry out a swift and thorough assessment of the damage and submit an application to the Commission within ten weeks. My colleague Mr Hahn will meet with Portugal's Interior Minister, Mr Pereira, this Friday to discuss where to go from here. On 6 and 7 March, Mr Hahn will visit Madeira in order to see the damage first hand. The European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy will be available to provide any support that may be required to help Portugal's authorities to prepare the application.
I would like to remind you that financial aid from our Solidarity Fund is not paid out straight away. The Fund is an instrument to help Member States deal with the financial consequences of disasters; it is not an urgent instrument. The resources for the Solidarity Fund are provided by means of an additional contribution from the Member States over and above the normal budget. It therefore requires the approval of the European Parliament, your approval in other words, and that of the Council, by means of an amendment. The whole process, from the time of the application until the aid is paid out, will take several months. However, we, the Commission, will make every effort to keep the process as short as possible.
The scene is one of large-scale destruction, involving significant material damage to access routes, with roads and bridges totally destroyed, and to essential services such as water and electricity supplies. There are more than 600 displaced persons who have lost their homes and personal possessions. The economic and social impact of this catastrophe is preventing people from returning to a normal way of life. However, it is now necessary to look forwards. We also need to send a message of solidarity, hope and confidence to the people affected. Help needs to be given, and the European Union and Parliament, in particular, have a role to play here, as they are fundamental in the process of mobilising the Solidarity Fund. Whenever we are called upon to intervene, we have to do so promptly because we cannot ask the people affected to wait, especially when they need us most.
I hereby appeal to the Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, and to Johannes Hahn, Commissioner for Regional Policy, in particular. I welcome his plan to visit Madeira shortly, and ask him to take this message of hope, assistance and support for reconstruction, because now is the time to rebuild what nature has unfortunately taken from us once again. I have complete faith that we will do so because, as the anthem of Madeira has taught me, 'the people of Madeira are humble, stoical and brave. They are the people who ploughed the earth among the hard rocks; they are heroes of working in the mountain wilderness. For Madeira, they will honour their history and through their work, they will strive for and attain happiness and glory.'
on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PT) On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I wish to express our condolences to the families of the victims, and show our solidarity with the people affected by the tragedy that struck the Autonomous Region of Madeira, in Portugal, on the 20th of this month. Torrential rain, strong winds and heavy seas rendered the centre of the tourist city of Funchal unrecognisable and left devastation and death in their wake. There has also been great damage to public and private infrastructure, as well as the natural environment and cultural heritage. Initial estimates, Commissioner, suggest that damage will exceed EUR 1 billion, so this will fall within the criteria for the Solidarity Fund. Unfortunately, there are also dozens of dead to mourn, a considerable number of injured and missing people and hundreds of homeless. The images of devastation and suffering have been shown all over the world and no one has remained indifferent. Expressions of solidarity have come from all four corners of the globe.
However, a minute's silence must make us reflect and also lead us to reflect on things that go beyond our immediate concerns here. What we saw in Madeira is a phenomenon which will occur more and more often. Climate change is causing these extreme events to take place again and again, and we must find ways of responding to them. We are not able to avoid natural disasters but, at the same time, we must not simply allow them always to have such tragic effects on the lives of the people. That is why we must fight for planning and development policies which are directed at the public good. However, I wish to conclude, Mr President, with something that is more important and which has brought us all here: the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European institutions must have the capacity to provide an urgent response to emergency situations. Financial resources and the required swiftness of operation are necessary for this purpose.
(PT) The tragedy in Madeira took many lives, destroyed property and tore through the face of a Portuguese island which was proud of its beauty, which so many visitors from around the world have had the opportunity to see. I suppose no one, not even in Portugal - much less in Portugal, in fact - could have been prepared for the horror of the images that were broadcast into our homes in successive news reports, of people being washed away by the waters, houses caving in, bridges collapsing and an entire landscape being altered by the force of nature.
As can be seen from the statements being made here, despite everything, this is not simply a tragedy which occurred in a region of Portugal. It is a tragedy which violently struck part of the European Union which, in solidarity, should provide assistance without reservation. It should unreservedly help the families of the victims who have died and the people who have suddenly been left with nothing, and it should assist in the reconstruction of the built environment, by restoring to the island of Madeira what nature has stripped away. This, Mr President, is certain: the message of the anthem of Madeira has been mentioned here, but I have also drawn a lesson from the anthem of Portugal, which proclaims, 'heroes of the sea, noble people, brave nation'. These are brave people who, as they have shown on other occasions in their history, have always known how to turn things around during difficult times and how to overcome such misfortunes.
(DE) Mr President, this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate. Madeira has been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster and we extend our condolences to the families affected. The European Union must provide support in this situation. The solidarity of the whole of the European Union is required here and I can only reiterate what has already been said. I urge the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible so that help can be provided. I would like to ask the Council to ensure that the reform of the Solidarity Fund that Parliament adopted two years ago is finally implemented, because this will make it possible to provide assistance more quickly to the regions affected.
Tragedies are not fair; almost always, those who have the least are those who lose the most. It is important, therefore, to identify and compensate, as far as possible, all those who have lost family members, their homes and their livelihoods. What has happened in Madeira has dramatically shown us the importance of strengthening cooperation and solidarity in the European Union as well as in the area of disaster prevention. It is important at this point to build a suitable financial framework for prevention that strengthens and makes use of mechanisms such as cohesion policy, rural development policy and regional policy, amongst others, in order to assist Member States in the implementation of measures to protect people, the environment and the economy.
Mr President, I would like to express the sorrow felt by all members of the Committee on Regional Development at the terrible loss of life in Madeira and our intention to do all we can to assist Madeira in its hour of need. Of course, the national and regional authorities are already doing their utmost to relieve the difficulties encountered by the people and especially those who have been left homeless and we urgently await their request for European assistance through the European Solidarity Fund. I am sure it will be treated with the utmost expediency by all concerned.
We ask the European Commission to mobilise all its resources and review with the Portuguese authorities how the ongoing European programmes can be adjusted to assist the region. Let me emphasise that the existing Solidarity Fund continues to have well-known limitations. Back in April 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for the revision of the regulation, which was then adopted by the Parliament at first reading in May 2006. Despite the undeniable usefulness of a more flexible Solidarity Fund, despite the necessity of extending its ambit of operations to cover unforeseen man-made disasters and criminal acts as well as natural ones, the Council has been unable to reach a common position on the review of the fund since May 2006.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, disasters are, of course, also a consequence of global warming. We need to endeavour to deal with these developments, which we are faced with on an increasingly frequent basis. The question therefore arises as to whether assistance should not be provided from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, particularly to workers in Madeira, because many work places will, of course, have been destroyed, and whether we could not support the small and medium-sized enterprises in the reconstruction work. We could provide a significant amount of help to craftsmen and the services sector in particular.
As someone who lives in a mountainous region, I understand very well what happened here. Similar mistakes were made here to those made in our country. We carried out alignment work and hydraulic engineering work without taking nature into account, and out of small streams and channels, great rivers came. I watched these events, which were also the order of the day in Austria two or three years ago, with horror, in other words, with heartfelt sympathy and understanding. Immediately after the clean-up, after the damage limitation, we need to work together to rectify these mistakes. We offer our help in doing this. We received international help when we suffered our major avalanche disaster in Galtür. International help was needed to enable us to evacuate a whole village and to rescue the people and fly them out. This is an appropriate time to send out a positive signal and to show international European solidarity, and I for one am prepared to do what I can to help in this regard.
(PT) I also wish to express my solidarity with the pain of the people of Madeira and implore the European institutions, particularly the Commission, to release all the available resources and do everything within their power to provide this assistance. I would also like to emphasise that when misfortunes of this type occur, it is much more difficult to address their consequences if they occur in poor countries and poor regions. In the case of Madeira, however, we must also take account of the fact that the economic base of Madeira has been affected due its dependence on tourism, so it has suffered a double blow. Its natural beauty, access routes and quality of life have been completely destroyed. Therefore, the situation really is different when we have problems of this severity in poor countries and poor regions, especially in mountainous and tourist regions, as in the case of Madeira.
You have made an impressive appeal to the Commission to assist Madeira in its current situation and to show a sign of European solidarity. The Commission is prepared to do that. Precisely how it can do that will need to be worked out in the next few days and weeks in close cooperation with the Portuguese authorities. We must, and will, observe the rules of the Fund. Where they provide some leeway, the Commission will use that for the benefit of Madeira. First of all, the damage needs to be assessed and then an application for assistance has to be drawn up and submitted. That is the order in which things need to be done. The Directorate-General for Regional Policy and my colleague, Commissioner Hahn, will provide advice and support in this regard.
Mrs Estrela called for the further development of the key directive and the rules of the Fund. More than four years ago, the Commission presented a proposal in this regard, which Parliament supported. It is currently still with the Council. However, by way of qualification, I would like to say that the proposals that we made at that time would not provide any better opportunities for assistance in this particular case. It is right that prevention must remain an area of focus for our policy. Cohesion policy is therefore precisely the right instrument to use.
in writing. - (PT) I would like to express my profound sympathy and solidarity with the people of Madeira, their institutions and the regional government in view of the tragedy of force majeure which occurred on 20 February in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and which caused several dozen deaths, disappearances, displaced persons, injuries and huge material damage. This situation requires rapid and effective measures of solidarity from the EU. Hence, it requires the greatest possible promptness of all those involved in the allocation of the Solidarity Fund, so that it can be mobilised without delay. It is also crucial that the various funds of the European Union be mobilised in a flexible manner, through advance payments, simplified procedures and a higher rate of cofinancing in order to meet the needs of the Autonomous Region of Madeira. We advocate that the Solidarity Fund should be revised in the manner that has already been requested by Parliament. This fund must function as an emergency fund in which lead times are much reduced and the sums made available are increased.
I would like to offer my condolences to the families of those who have died as a result of the floods and landslides caused by heavy rain on Madeira. Nature cannot be cheated, and since we cannot prevent natural disasters, we should do everything to prevent their destructive effects and come to the assistance of their victims. In the face of natural disasters and other crisis situations, the European Union should be able to react rapidly and efficiently by using appropriate resources. In relation to this, as I have already stressed in amendments submitted relating to the draft report of Mr Danjean on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy, it is essential to ensure the efficient functioning of instruments for reacting to crisis situations by good organisation of command centres, appropriate to the needs of action taken as part of the first and second pillars. Good planning and efficient management of these centres will allow successful action to be taken on the territories of European Union Member States and of other states which need help.
As is too often the case when rail accidents happen, remarks alleging a link between European rules or regulations and the accident are made. I would first like to be very clear on the opening-up of the market. Alongside the opening-up of the rail freight sector to competition and the establishment of requirements to separate the activities of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, a stringent regulatory framework has been introduced governing rail safety and interoperability. We want to ensure that the high level of rail safety is maintained, while recognising the procedures and methods specific to each Member State in this area.
After accidents have occurred, new proposals are often made in a political context. I must say that in this case, everything was in place, both the legislation and the technology. The only thing which perhaps was lacking was the will to make the technology a high priority. Since the middle of the 1990s, the technology has been available to enable the safe transition between the European system and the advanced Belgian system, in other words, the so-called TBL 1+ system. There has been no lack of time or of technical facilities.
We do have to await the results of the investigation before drawing real, detailed conclusions, of course, but that does not change the fact that railway safety must remain a permanent area of attention at all levels, including the European level, and that we must therefore evaluate, improve, supplement and adjust safety policy on a regular basis. I should like to join my fellow Member and also you, Commissioner, in making quite clear our regret that a number of individuals with significant responsibilities in Belgium have sought to pass responsibility for the accident on to Europe or have at least given that impression. The delay in the development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) has been cited in particular as a reason why now, in 2010, only a handful of locomotives in Belgium are equipped with the automatic stop system.
Ladies and gentlemen, on the other hand, let us make one thing clear, and let us be frank about this: the development of this good idea - a single signalling system to replace the 20 separate systems - has taken longer than hoped or expected. This, of course, is attributable to the technical complexity and to the fact that agreement on a standard has to be reached among a very large number of countries, namely 27, although at the time, there were a couple fewer. Of course, there are also associated budgetary consequences. Yet, as you rightly said, this has not stopped a single Member State from developing its own system or starting to use a kind of embryonic version of ERTMS at an early stage.
Secondly, however, and I think that this is an important task for the Commission and the European Railway Agency, we must also monitor whether existing European safety legislation is being implemented in practice in the field. I would cite the example of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways. This lays down, among other things, that a safety authority is to be established in each Member State, which must be independent from the railway undertakings and the infrastructure manager, and whose tasks include monitoring, encouraging and enforcing railway safety and developing a regulatory framework. I have the feeling, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not working particularly well in Belgium, and I think that you should organise a kind of audit to look into whether Member States do indeed have the capacity to guarantee this safety proactively in their national rail systems. That is a task I should like to entrust to you.
In my country, a number of questions have been raised as to the nature of Europe's approach to the railways. I have to be honest with you: I am shocked that some people have accused us of neglecting safety. I was Parliament's rapporteur on the Railway Safety Directive to which Mr El Khadraoui has just referred, and I am proud of the work we did back then. We told ourselves that we needed to be very demanding as regards safety in all Member States and we needed to establish a European framework for this and to lay down requirements. We got this past the Member States with very great difficulty. I note - and Mr El Khadraoui rightly mentioned this - that in some countries, unfortunately, including my own, the implementation of this directive at national level is in fact poorly organised. I hope you take another good look at this, Commissioner. Perhaps this House, too, should take another look at the directive and tighten up the framework, as Mr Grosch said. It is not true that we are neglecting safety, therefore; the reverse is true.
I shall refrain from drawing any conclusions, just as those who have spoken before me have done. The investigation is under way, and we shall not speculate on its results. However, it is clear that, in Belgium's case, it is regrettable that the railways should have taken so long to equip themselves with an automatic train protection system, as some have already mentioned. When I heard, in the wake of the disaster, that, whilst budgetary reasons could not be cited, the delays in the development of European interoperability standards were being called into question as a means of explaining this accident, I found it unacceptable and I immediately felt that Europe was at the centre of groundless accusations.
The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) does, in fact, offer companies an opportunity to invest in safety in a coordinated and interoperable manner. We must rid ourselves of the countless national standards that curb development and competitiveness, at a time when the European Train Control System (ETCS) is evolving. It is, of course, evolving, and it will continue to evolve. This is what it takes to preserve a very high level of technology. Moreover, I have no doubt that, in the next five or 10 years, there will be many more developments to come.
The investigation into the causes of the rail accident in Buizingen has yet to be completed, and so I cannot comment on it, but I have come to the following conclusion. When there is a train crash in the United Kingdom, people are quick to attribute it to the privatisation of the railways. The Belgian railways (SNCB) receive relatively the highest subsidy in the whole of the European Union. Belgium gives 32 euro cents per passenger/kilometre to its railways. France comes second with 24 euro cents. The Netherlands gives 15 euro cents and the UK 4 euro cents. Despite all these subsidies, the SNCB still has debts of EUR 10 billion. Where does the money go?
Since the Buizingen accident, its terrible human death toll and the serious physical and psychological suffering that it has caused have served as a powerful reminder that it is high time we launched a serious debate on rail safety. Let us dismiss straight away the idea that all accidents are, by nature, unforeseeable. The main factor in the lack of safety across Europe's rail networks is a direct consequence of the separation between the management of our rail infrastructure and the management of our rolling stock. This separation - it must be said forcefully here - has been imposed by the Commission against the better judgment of railway workers so that the rail sector can be opened up to competition. It greatly increases the likelihood of accidents. Because of this separation, the maintenance of the European rail network is being sacrificed for the sake of the highest profits. You may try to buy some time by proposing the use of the best modern-day techniques as the only option for solving the problems. Ultimately, however, it is a different rail policy that we need in Europe. If, each year, there are fewer railway workers, less maintenance, less investment and less training, it is inevitable that we will have to address the issue of accidents once again and pay mournful tributes. In order to ensure genuine rail safety, the Union has to turn the page on competition so as to open that of cooperation.
The management of the Belgian railways (SNCB) is highly politicised and inefficient, and a typical feature of Belgian politics is that, when something goes wrong, no one is ever responsible for anything at all. In 2001, a train crash occurred in Pécrot that was similar to last week's in Buizingen. Nine years ago, everyone thought serious action would be taken to improve the safety system; yet this did not happen. Pending the introduction of the European Train Control System (ETCS), Belgium developed its own system, but this came far too late and was extremely inadequate.
After disasters of this kind, people's first response is often to find someone to blame. However, the European Union, the Commission and the safety provisions which we introduced in Directive 2004/49 must not be made into the scapegoat in this case. On the other hand, the important question is, of course, whether we should tighten up the safety provisions. The investigations into this rail accident have not yet been completed and, therefore, we cannot yet expect any clear results. The major question that we must ask ourselves is whether it would have been possible to avoid this accident. We cannot exclude human error or technical failures and therefore both of these things play a role in rail safety. All rail operators, both state-owned and private, have an obligation to provide the necessary level of safety. The national rail companies must ensure that they are complying with the appropriate safety standards.
I do not want to give any lectures from a German point of view in this situation. I simply want to say that in Germany, we have attempted to implement the directive in its entirety. Wherever there is the possibility of human error, technical systems must be able to intervene. I remember the dead man's handle which automatically applied the brakes if the handle was not pressed for a minute. If a train passes a red stop signal, the brakes are also automatically applied. We must have systems of this kind in place. The European Train Control System must be implemented so that we have some influence over these things from the outside.
The aim is to compare the implementation of the European safety and signalling standards with working conditions from the moment when this liberalisation of the rail sector within each Member States came into effect. The Commission must therefore consider the role of public services in more general terms. The Parti Socialiste - the party to which I belong - has long been calling for positive action from the European Union to protect and develop public services. This is the idea behind the introduction of a framework directive on services of general interest. The latter would guarantee public services a stable legislative framework and adequate funding in compliance with the principles of universality and equality of access.
However, there is one factor that must never be ignored, and that is the human factor. In any liberalisation - I know that you support liberalisation, I support it far less, and indeed I oppose it where public services are concerned - the human factor is overlooked. Terrible pressure is put on members of staff, who work for hours on end or, in any case, for longer periods of time and without rest. As a train driver, one is responsible for passenger safety. Therefore, I believe it is important to ask about working conditions and any changes in those conditions. I believe that this is an important point.
It is indeed outrageous to hear a British Tory, I take it, a Member of this Parliament, malign and slander Belgian railway workers in the course of his contribution when it is quite clear that the policies of neoliberalisation and deregulation have done enormous damage to our railway system as a public facility. There is, in fact, enormous frustration among Belgian railway workers. This was clear from spontaneous strikes among those workers in the days after this tragedy, in response to it. This is the third serious incident in Belgium in nine months.
After a previous tragedy in Belgium in 2001, comprehensive safety measures were promised but have not been implemented. The reality is that workers on the Belgian railways are under continuous pressure to work longer, with journeys being extended and fewer breaks, which means less safety. Of course, the perfidious policy of the EU Commission of liberalisation and privatisation will threaten safety further. It means that the profits of major transport companies come first. It is clear that the best structure to guarantee safety is to maintain the rail infrastructure in public ownership with democratic control and necessary investment.
As a former railway employee, I have experienced the changes myself. I would like to mention some of the problems which, to a certain extent, have an impact on safety. At the beginning of the 1990s, instead of introducing competition on the railways, we should first have started a process of technical harmonisation. We should have overcome all the problems that Mr Kallas mentioned in the 1990s. We should only have opened up the market to competition on the basis of technical harmonisation. The fragmentation of the companies has resulted in many players being involved in the rail system and this is a system which only functions properly when it is operated as a single entity. Therefore, in my opinion, the Member States, the rail companies, the infrastructure operators and also the Commission, which, as has already been said, introduced directives and regulations without carrying out an interim evaluation, share the responsibility for the most recent accidents. The evaluation was only completed a short time ago. The rail companies have made the mistake of choosing the wrong strategy and of waiting too long for a European system. They have constantly attempted to reduce costs, have employed staff without the necessary level of skills, as already mentioned, and they have also invested too little.
The recent rail accident in Belgium, with a casualty list of 20 dead and more than 120 injured, refocuses our attention in a shocking way on the importance of rail transport safety. Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis has exacerbated the financial difficulties facing both operators and administrators involved in the rail transport infrastructure. It is a major concern that the lack of specialist staff and financial resources for implementing the ERTMS is one of the possible causes of the accident, while thousands of rail workers are losing their jobs. I call on Member States and the Commission to take the necessary measures in order to:
(PL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my sympathy to the victims' families. I would like to talk about something which seems to me to be very important, and which has not been said here. There is a debate here which, in many ways, is justified. I, too, have my own very clear views on the matter. I think a deregulated market is significantly better than a market dominated by state-owned firms, but I would like to talk about something which is important in the context of this discussion.
This dispute is not only about whether a firm is state-owned or privately-owned; it is also about whether the market is a free market or a restricted, regulated market, which often means, in fact, that in many Member States, there is a monopoly held by a single state-owned firm. There are so many railway systems, and they are not only different in each Member State, but in many cases, different systems are in use in a single Member State, and the systems we are talking about are often a protectionist administrative barrier put up only to protect the monopoly firm in the national market. In many cases, certain equipment and locomotives are not allowed, simply to limit the possibility of a competitor from another country or a private competitor from entering the market. The consequence of this is the establishment of so many different systems and the emergence of safety problems.
If you looked at the allocation of structural funds for infrastructure projects in new Member States, you would see that in those countries, there is practically no money for railway infrastructure. The administrators who are supposed to fill in applications and apply for money are not in the least interested in this. We are dealing with a model in which many Member States do not want anything to change in their railways, so that competition coming from other countries or the private market, for example, will not be in a good position. It is then safety and competitiveness which suffer because of this.
As we know, and you have already said, it is not Europe's fault that the automatic stop system has yet to be fully introduced in Belgium. Yet this does not mean that Europe is not now required to act; quite the reverse. We expressly call for the European Commission, too, to now carry out an evaluation, which must provide the answers to several very specific questions. For example, as you know, we have obliged railway companies - including private firms - to fully equip their trains with the new European Train Control System (ETCS) as of 2013, yet we already know that Europe's railway lines will not have been equipped with that system by then.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, two locomotives were involved in this dreadful accident which were operated by the SNCB, the Belgian National Railways, on a state rail network. There is no competition on the rail passenger transport market in Belgium. Therefore, this has nothing to do with competition or with the opening up of the network. It is all about unsatisfactory safety standards. Mr Grosch has already pointed out that the technology for stopping a train automatically when it passes a red signal has been in existence for more than 20 years. The question is: why was it not installed?
in writing. - (DE) The tragic train accident in Belgium has attracted public attention to safety on the railways. The safety of the rolling stock must be improved, as well as the safety of the signalling systems. There are many completely outdated goods wagons, in particular, on the railways in Europe. The accident in Italy last year demonstrated the possible consequences of this. Unfortunately the EU has so far done very little to oblige freight operators to bring their rolling stock up to an acceptable safety standard. It is important to remember that hazardous goods are also transported by rail, which could have devastating consequences in the event of an accident. Against this background, I am calling for higher safety standards on the railways.
However, it did have one particular, fundamental cause: the liberalisation of rail transport and the separation of the management of the network from that of rail transport itself. Therefore, the network, its quality and its safety have been sacrificed for the sake of the profit of transport operators, which are finding the tolls imposed on them to be too high, just as the replacement and the modernisation of trains is being sacrificed. The timetables and frequency of services today respond to the logic of profit making, and no longer to the needs of users. Even though they are used regularly, some lines are being taken out of service because they are not profitable enough. Others are still in service when common sense suggests that they should not be. Delays are becoming the norm, including in the case of TGV services.
In view of the tragic accident in Brussels, we are once again faced with the issue that Member States have not yet fully harmonised their rail safety systems, even though Directive 2004/49/EC clearly establishes common standards for safety indicators and fully meets safety requirements overall, including for infrastructure and traffic management. The major problem is actually a strictly financial issue: the service life of the railway infrastructures and rolling stock, including the signalling systems, is extremely long. In these circumstances, it would be desirable for Member States to look beyond this financial issue, in spite of the crisis, and to consider accelerating the implementation of interoperable systems, as well as invest more in the railway infrastructure and signalling systems for both the infrastructure and rolling stock.
I would ask you to communicate to the Cuban authorities your strongest condemnation of this completely avoidable death, which the head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, described as a murder dressed up as justice. I hope, Mr President, that this death will lead to reflection among those who, out of good faith or naivety, want to change the Council's common position, an honourable position that merely serves to link any improvement in relations with the island to human rights and fundamental freedoms, which, as we have seen, continue to be violated.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose an oral amendment for a split vote on paragraph 10, concerning the following passage: 'considers that the inclusion of this concept in the Protocol on complementary standards on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination is not appropriate'. A split vote must be held on this central part, because I do not understand why we are combining these things and not making it clear that we must combat discrimination against religious minorities just as vigorously as all other types of discrimination. It is not acceptable for the measures to combat discrimination against religious minorities to be less strict. Therefore, we should have the possibility of a split vote.
(HU) The aim of the regulation is a positive one: to collect information from Member States relating to energy infrastructure, organise it and make it accessible at Community level to economic actors. It thus - rightly - intervenes in the functioning of the market. Parliament has, however, accepted an initiative that is diametrically opposed to this, and even goes so far as to regard that as being the political aim of the regulation. I quote: Any measures proposed or taken at Union level should be neutral and should not amount to interventions in the functioning of the market. The majority of those sitting in this Parliament have learnt nothing from the global financial and economic crisis. It continues to stand up for neoliberal dogmas and even in this strategic area, it trusts in the self-regulation of the market. This is unacceptable, and hence I have voted against the resolution.
(PL) Mr President, I will speak very briefly. The whole idea is quite right. I particularly like the emphasis on the ecological aspect. Since we are talking about this, let us be consistent. It was precisely matters relating to ecology and environment protection which were the significant, factual arguments on which opposition to the idea of the Northern Gas Pipeline was based. Those very justified, practical and scientifically substantiated arguments were thrown away because political reasons had triumphed. I think that when supporting this project, we should remember not to be hypocritical in politics. With the Northern Gas Pipeline, this was forgotten by many Member States of the European Union and by many of the political groups.
(LT) I would particularly like to stress my support for Ukraine for holding democratic elections and giving people the opportunity to express their free will. Knowing Ukraine well, I can see that not just the government, but society itself, is actively following the path to democracy and establishing democratic institutions. I also have the hope that these elections will bring Ukraine even closer to the European Union, and may even build a stronger bridge in EU-Russia cooperation. I am also delighted that perhaps even a post-Soviet country will soon enter a visa-free regime with the European Union.
I would also like to draw attention to the decision of outgoing President Yushchenko to confer the title of 'National Hero of Ukraine' on Stefan Bandera, and the decree recognising two nationalist organisations, the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, as participants in the fight for Ukraine's independence. Both Stefan Bandera and these two organisations were responsible for ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the Polish population in the 1940s in parts of what is, today, western Ukraine. The nationalists murdered 120 000 Poles. In wishing the very best for Ukraine, I do hope that the glorification of extreme, criminal nationalism will be condemned.
Today, Ukraine needs political, administrative and economic stability. Therefore, while respecting the democratic choice of the Ukrainian people, we should support and accelerate those measures which will help Ukraine overcome existing problems. The European Union should give a clear signal that the door is open for Ukraine's accession to the European Union. If the European Union is truly interested in Ukraine, the first step towards this should be lifting the visa requirement for Ukrainians. I hope that adoption of today's resolution will accelerate work on bringing these ideas into being. This is why I voted for adoption of the resolution.
(PL) Mr President, I had the pleasure of being an observer during the presidential elections in Ukraine, at both the first and second rounds, as, indeed, I had several years ago. I would like to say that we should treat Ukraine as a partner, and not interfere with the sympathies of the Ukrainian electorate. I consider as absolutely unnecessary the statement made in this House yesterday by one of the leaders of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a liberal, who said that the new President will be pro-Moscow. The new President of Ukraine, on his first foreign visit since taking office, is coming to Brussels. We should assess Ukrainian politicians by what they do, and not by whatever declarations they might have made. Ukraine should be our political partner, and we should open the way for Ukraine to join the European Union. I am pleased by the statement of the new President that he will annul the decree which Mr Kalinowski spoke about, the scandalous decree which recognises as a national hero of Ukraine a man who has the blood of many thousands of Poles on his hands.
From this perspective, I believe that the European Union should continue the dialogue with Ukraine and press for a more intensive and more effective dialogue. Ukraine genuinely needs help from the EU, and it is, above all, the people that need it, not the politicians, but the people of Ukraine, and cooperation between Ukraine and the EU could result in a very strong partnership, as well as very strong collaboration and a very strong boost to the economy. I would like us to show greater initiative in this area.
Mr President, it is human nature when something unexpected happens that we try and fit the facts into our existing Weltanschauung. The psychiatrists have a fancy phrase for it, an even fancier phrase than Weltanschauung: they call it 'cognitive dissonance'. Thus, for example, when there is a 'no' vote in a referendum, the reaction of this House is to say that the people wanted more Europe. They were voting 'no' because this did not go in a sufficiently federalist direction.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say on behalf of part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and, above all, on behalf of my colleague, Elmar Brok, that we are shocked that the House has today rejected the amendment which would have included Christians and other religious minorities in this report. I think it is truly outrageous that, although we are constantly making statements on human rights issues, we do not believe it is worth protecting parts of the population who are being persecuted because of their religious background. It is a great pity that we could not accept the amendment which concerns a subject that is of great importance for the future of the world. If we are not able to protect minorities for whatever reason, we no longer have the right to claim that the European Parliament is the home of human rights, of fundamental rights and of this struggle throughout the world. I have voted against this, because religious minorities should not be excluded.
(NL) In my view, Parliament should be a little ashamed of the de facto budget amendment it has just adopted in this report. After all, more or less all European countries are suffering a huge financial and economic crisis and masses of people are losing their jobs, and the best we can come up with is to allocate ourselves substantially more resources, more staff and more costs at the taxpayer's expense. Besides, everyone knows that these additional resources and staff members are, in fact, mainly intended to ensure that the various socialists who lost their mandates in recent elections are well looked after financially. In the past, too, this has led to other substantial increases in subsidies, including to European political parties and European political foundations. It is striking that, time and again, we are finding nice-sounding arguments for delving even further into the tax coffers for this institution; an unacceptable practice in these times of crisis.
The part of it that relates to increasing human resources for Parliamentary committees and groups to the sum of EUR 4 million can be justified because the Treaty of Lisbon is making new legislative demands of Parliament. Increasing MEPs' funds for hiring assistants by EUR 8 million, however, means that next year, it will not be 8 million, but 16 million, and this is clearly excessive, as in the coming year, a new increase of EUR 1 500 per month is planned for Members, which amounts to not 16, but EUR 32 million. At a time when we are seeing massive unemployment and social crisis in all our countries, moving towards increases in resources for Members is not sustainable unless, at the same time, we have the courage to cut down on the expenses and allowances to which we are entitled as Members, and which are by no means all completely justified.
I fail to understand how, for a day of travelling, an MEP can receive EUR 300 in allowances, plus a subsidy for the distance travelled and a subsidy for the time taken, provisions that are entirely tax-free. We can cut undue expenses and then debate how we can increase our means for law making. Not doing this at the same time simply shows a disregard for the difficulties that our constituents are experiencing. We have a duty to set a good example, but today we are setting a bad one.
The justification which is given in this report is a very interesting one because the reason that we are told we need all of this extra spending is because of the additional responsibilities created by the Lisbon Treaty. In a way, that is true, but I think not in the way that the authors intended it. What we see is that the bureaucracy is expanding to service the needs of the bureaucracy. The primary function of the Lisbon Treaty is to provide additional work and additional revenue for all the tens of thousands who are now directly or indirectly dependent on the European Union for their livelihoods. The one lot of people that we have not consulted about this are the electorates and I would love to see issues like this put before our voters to see whether they approve of our voting ourselves additional resources at such a time, when now all of them are tightening their own belts.
That argument is becoming academic because the fish have effectively disappeared. Even in the time that I have been in this House, there has been a calamitous decline in what ought to have been a renewable resource. In other countries which found a way to incentivise ownership, to give the fishermen a reason to treat the seas as a renewable harvest, they managed to sustain their fish levels: in Iceland, in Norway, in New Zealand, in the Falkland Islands. But in Europe, we had the tragedy of 'the commons', where we said it was a common resource to which all vessels had equal access.
I voted in favour of the report on investment in energy infrastructure, which is aimed at ensuring energy supply and competitive potential, and strengthening the fight against climate change. This report compels the governments of the European Union to give information to the Commission in relation to the investment being made in energy infrastructure, in modernisation, or in efficient energy production, which will help with efficiency, cooperation and energy planning in the European Union. Combating climate change, ensuring energy supply and using renewable energy: these are very important issues in the European Union and greater efforts must be made to encourage and ensure effective, focussed investment, and it must be ensured that these issues remain at the heart of the European Union's energy policy.
We are today voting in favour of this regulation, bolstered by the increased authority that the Treaty of Lisbon confers on Parliament within the context of defining energy policies. It is definitely beneficial to pursue interinstitutional cooperation aimed at planning the EU's contribution to the design and implementation of energy infrastructure in a systematic, rational and far-sighted manner: I am thinking of the possible advantages for the programming of the TEN-E and the launch of pilot projects for CO2 storage, which represent the future of energy. However, the information obligations imposed by the regulation could mean that the policy interferes too much in the economy and that competition is undermined, as a result of news being spread about the projects. It is therefore important to ensure that the data that is gathered and managed safeguards the confidentiality and the activities of businesses. Analysis of this data will certainly help to ensure that best use is made of the investments. However, the analysis must be accompanied by concrete financial measures to support those works and to provide an incentive for private investment in the sector. The Marguerite Fund for infrastructure, energy and climate change must be strengthened. The initiative is valid and necessary, but this fund needs to be swelled with the EU resources that are already available in the budget and linked to forms of financing guaranteed by the European Investment Bank and/or other financial institutions, so that it can have an adequate share in the equity of the individual public-private partnerships that are in operation.
I would remind you that before moving on to new projects, the EU's objective of achieving the target of 20% for energy efficiency must be taken into account. This means that investment projects in energy infrastructures must be compatible with the aim of achieving a minimum of 20% of energy from sustainable, renewable sources by 2020. The energy policy that is being advocated must ensure low carbon emissions and be based on solidarity and sustainability. The reliability of the system is important, as operation must be continuous. It must take account of the deterioration of the energy sector in terms of supply, which can be seen both inside and outside the EU. It is also worth paying attention to crucial investment in infrastructure that manages to avoid security problems in terms of energy supply.
The proposal shows the effects of the emergency gas supply situation that emerged in January 2009, when the Commission realised that the Union's energy infrastructure was not fit for purpose. The European Commission's aim, which Parliament fully supported, was to have a constantly updated picture of the energy infrastructure system. Today, there is great uncertainty about whether the investment projects will be carried out, and it has been made worse by the economic and financial crisis. I believe that intervention is necessary and that the lack of consistent data and information on investment projects should be remedied. Without this data, it is impossible to analyse the expected development of the Union's infrastructure and to introduce satisfactory monitoring in view of a cross-sector approach. Moreover, Regulation (EC) No 736/96, which the proposal in question repeals, is no longer applied consistently and is incompatible with the recent developments in the energy sector. With this proposal, we have therefore strengthened the existing system, significantly improving the comparability of the information while, at the same time, reducing the associated administrative burdens. Lastly, I should like to emphasise the fact that I voted against Amendment 81 (by which the entire nuclear energy chain was to be included in the infrastructure covered by the regulation), since there are already provisions which regulate these matters in the Euratom Treaty.
EU energy policy is very pertinent if we are to succeed in using mostly renewable energy in the near future. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, decisions on matters relating to energy policy are made in codecision, so it is necessary to readjust the regulations based on the new legal set-up within the EU. For this reason, and so that all Member States are able to communicate the planned development of energy infrastructure in a satisfactory and beneficial way, a new regulation needs to be implemented to make this easier and faster.
The aim of this motion for a resolution is to ensure that Member States provide accurate information on their projects in the area of energy infrastructure. As soon as a project in the energy sector is started or discontinued, this must be reported to the Commission, so that the Commission acquires the ability to draw up new or amended project proposals, thereby gaining significant influence over the energy diversity of individual Member States. This represents a further step in the direction of centralisation. I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution.
This regulation is very important because it aims to ensure that the Commission is accurately and regularly informed of investment projects in energy infrastructure, at both national and cross-border level, so that the Union can ensure that the internal market functions correctly and that all the Member States have a secure energy supply. It seeks to update the 1996 Regulation with regard to the Union's commitments on security of supply, climate change and renewable energies following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This report is of special interest because it reinforces the regulation's role as an early warning system for interconnection deficiencies. Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has always stressed the need to achieve a 10% interconnection between Member States, as stipulated by the European Council, and any provision that highlights shortcomings in this respect is very positive. I therefore voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the final resolution mainly because, during the vote, we managed to get: Codecision: this is a huge victory, since, for the first time, we now the TFEU (Lisbon Treaty) legal basis on energy to get codecision against the will of the Commission. Even more historic, for the first time since I worked in this House, we managed to get rid of the Euratom Treaty as a legal basis although this regulation covers also transparency for investments in the nuclear sector. This has been confirmed by the positive vote on AM 30 listing nuclear fuels as a primary energy source under the scope of the regulation. For sure, we will have to fight now to maintain this victory in the upcoming tripartite negotiations with Council and COM; MS must provide, at least five years before construction starts, the amount and types of investment in energy projects. This is a really wise move towards better future energy scenarios, since the Commission will get a better idea of how the energy market is evolving; renewables, including decentralised ones, will have to be fully considered; every single mention of 'low carbon', the pro-nuclear Trojan horse has been deleted.
I support this resolution and endorse the observations set out in it wholeheartedly. I am delighted that the Presidential elections that took place reflected the considerable progress made by Ukraine and went better than previous elections, in particular, from the point of view of respect for citizens' and political rights, including freedom of assembly, association and expression. Compliance with international election standards demonstrates that Ukraine is taking the path to a mature democracy and closer cooperation with the EU, based on mutual respect for the fundamental values of the EU. We must encourage Ukraine to actively participate in the Eastern Partnership and support its efforts to ensure more democracy and respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the commitment to safeguard the market economy, sustainable development and good governance.
The new Ukrainian president is faced with major challenges at a time when the International Monetary Fund has suspended the stand-by agreement signed with Kiev, due to numerous unfulfilled or breached commitments. It is important that President Viktor Yanukovich does not forget the promises he made on the day he assumed his mandate. Ukraine needs, as the new leader in Kiev pointed out, internal stability, as well as to combat corruption and consolidate the economy on healthy foundations. Ukraine needs to regain the confidence of the business sector and international community to be able to successfully overcome the economic recession, exacerbated by an unstable political climate.
I abstained because I consider that relations between the European Union and other countries should be marked by equality, mutually beneficial trade and economic relations, non-interference in the internal development policies and democratic processes of each country and, of course, respect for the will of the people. Constructing a peaceful Europe presupposes, apart from anything else, the facility for each country to determine its international relations without imposition and pressure. As energy security is a crucial factor for the Member States of the European Union, the role of Ukraine is important, which is why it should be encouraged to address its energy problems by improving relations with Russia through bilateral agreements. That would be to the benefit of both sides and would ensure an uninterrupted flow of natural gas to Europe.
I welcome the compromise resolution drawn up on Ukraine, dealing not only with the issue of how democratic the last election was, but also offering solutions to the problem of transit supplies of oil and natural gas, and urging Ukraine to adopt the Energy Community Treaty and energy legislation conforming to Directive 2003/55/EC. I agree that an active and positive approach to the EU on the part of Ukraine is not the only assessment criterion. Ukraine must also, as a matter of priority, have good relations with its neighbouring countries, the countries of the Eastern Partnership and EURONEST. I support the proposals and also the other provisions in this compromise resolution as a whole and I will vote for their adoption.
As a reference area and a place for promoting peace and the economic, social and cultural development of its citizens, the European Union has a duty to take on a decisive role in the development of a democratic system within Ukraine, including strengthening the mechanisms for European integration. This will also help to ease regional conflicts within the country, which is of great geostrategic importance to the EU, in view of relations with Russia and Central Asia, particularly in terms of energy. In this process, I would also emphasise the contribution that this motion for a resolution has made to the integration into the EU of a large group of immigrant Ukrainians, along with promoting the role of young people and education in terms of social, economic and cultural progress within Ukraine.
Based on today's vote on the resolution on the situation in Ukraine, we welcomed not only that the presidential elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles, but also the inauguration of the new president, whom we are expecting to pursue a policy of openness and cooperation towards the EU. We emphasised the importance of signing additional agreements in the energy sector, thereby guaranteeing energy supply security. We also welcomed with this vote the need to continue discussions with a view to setting up a favourable system for granting visas. Ukraine has been invited by the message conveyed today to continue working with us so that it becomes definitely committed to progressing along the path to democracy. We have reconfirmed with this vote what we have said on other occasions as well, that we must demonstrate an open approach through dialogue and firm commitments in order to give Ukraine the necessary encouragement to favour a pro-European development. However, Ukraine must show that it is a trustworthy partner for us.
in writing. - I supported Amendment 2, tabled on behalf of the ECR Group, to the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Ukraine, which voices concern that the Nord Stream pipeline project undermines the principle of solidarity in the EU's energy security and will be constructed to circumvent Ukraine. Even if not directly relevant to the current situation in Ukraine, I fully share the view that the Nord Stream project has been designed by the Russian Government as primarily a political project with a goal to divide Europe and isolate not only Ukraine but also some new Member States. This amendment is a reminder that the debate on Nord Stream has not ended but is to be continued. The EU, which is heading toward a common energy market with the implementation of an energy solidarity principle, cannot rely on a long-term relationship with a politically orientated state-owned monopoly that has already failed economically and is defying the basic EU principles of open competition, transparency and separation of production, transportation and distribution.
The new Ukrainian president won the elections standing on a programme guaranteeing rights for minorities, and the EU must support the effective, long-term implementation of this programme. With this in mind, the law for implementing the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages needs to be adopted and enforced. Previous measures which drastically restricted the ability of schools to teach in the minorities' mother tongues must be repealed. The representation of minorities in local, district, regional and central institutions in Ukraine must be improved. Respect must be guaranteed for all minorities' rights in accordance with European standards, including Russians, Poles, Tatars, Bulgarians, Greeks, Romanians, Hungarians, Jews and Roma. No minority must be overlooked.
The recent elections held in Ukraine, taking into account the statements by the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission, which considered that most international standards had been met, are a signal that this country is continuing to develop positively by moving towards future integration into the EU. However, it is crucial that the Ukrainian politicians and authorities are committed to bringing about political and economic stabilisation soon. For this to be achieved, the necessary constitutional reforms must be implemented, with consolidation of the rule of law, the establishment of a social market economy and renewed efforts to combat corruption and the improvement of the climate for business and investment.
The motion for a resolution on the state of affairs in Ukraine addresses the current state of affairs in that country and the situation around the presidential elections extremely well. It reminds Ukrainian politicians and government organs of the need for political and economic stabilisation, which can, in particular, be achieved by constitutional reform, a consolidation of the rule of law, the establishment of a social market economy, renewed efforts to combat corruption, and the improvement of the economic and investment climate. Nevertheless, in my view, the considerations with regard to its rapid inclusion in the free trade zone, in other words, the EU common internal market, go too far. Ukraine must steadily build up and strengthen its economy, and come to an agreement over its own needs. For all Ukraine's European orientation, we must not forget or disregard that country's deep-seated roots in Russia's sphere of influence, and we must take that into consideration. For the reasons I have set out, I abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution.
Mr President, I supported the resolution by the European Parliament concerning the situation in Ukraine. Among other things, I believe that we should take very seriously the decision of President-Elect Yanukovich to come to Brussels for his first foreign visit. This is a clear sign that Ukraine is continuing its integration with the European Union. I consider it important for the European Union to show support for Ukraine in the present situation, by concluding an association agreement and also guaranteeing visa freedom, provided that Ukraine fulfils its objectives. The doors of the European Union must stay open for Ukraine.
During this plenary session we voted on the European Parliament resolution on the situation in Ukraine. I endorsed the resolution, because it is a very important declaration of our institution which testifies to the fact that we are carefully following the development of democracy in Ukraine. The resolution gives a generally good assessment of the course of the presidential elections, and calls for efforts to ensure the political and economic stability of the country. A key point is that it is essential to strengthen cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, especially in the area of energy. From my point of view, there were two controversial amendments. The first concerned minority languages. I voted against this amendment, because it increased the possibility of using Russian instead of Ukrainian. The second amendment was the one about the Nord Stream pipeline. In this case, I voted in favour of the amendment, because I wanted to manifest my opposition to construction of this pipeline.
The European Union campaigned for the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to be set up and has undertaken, along with Member States, to play an active, high-profile role to support an effective body which deals with the current challenges facing human rights. The new institutional structure created following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon offers the opportunity to improve the coherence, profile and credibility of the EU's actions as part of the UNHRC. This is why it is important for the EU to adopt a common, consolidated position during the 13th session of the UNHRC with regard to all the matters which will be discussed. The EU must have an effective influence as part of the UN's extended system and remain committed to finding a common position, as well as increase flexibility on less important issues to enable it to respond more quickly and effectively in negotiations on fundamental issues. Above all, it must be actively committed to creating dedicated UNHRC mechanisms for responding quickly and effectively to human rights crises in Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen.
in writing. - Human rights are still violated in many countries and it is unfortunate that grave violations sometimes are not addressed timely and properly by the international community. We are lacking a coordinated approach on the international stage. The EU's role as a global player has increased in recent decades and the newly established European External Action Service under the Lisbon Treaty could be instrumental in helping the Union to act more effectively to meet global challenges and to address human rights violations in a more coherent, consistent and efficient manner. The EU now has a great opportunity to strengthen its role in the UN Human Rights Council and should fully use it to increase visibility and credibility of EU actions in the area of human rights.
The compromise resolution put to the vote in this House unfortunately contains passages that prevent me from voting in favour. The UNHCR is a political body that is subject to 'extreme politicisation', as is acknowledged in the text of the resolution. However, we could have - I believe - said much more, especially since we are dealing with a subject that is sensitive and important to so many of us, namely human rights. Upon reading the text, I note an unfortunate weakness - perhaps not for the politics of diplomacy, but certainly for that of values - and that is the lack of determination when criticising the well-known aspects that make the UNHCR a very controversial body. We could have, in fact, been more decisive, speaking out more strongly against Iran's candidacy in the next Council elections. There is no specific reference to the senseless composition of a Council in which there sit too many members who are scarcely qualified to lecture on human rights, and who evidently have even fewer credentials to be able to judge or to try anyone. My vote is therefore one of abstention and of scepticism about this text: I am abstaining in the hope that Parliament will take off its diplomatic hat - it is not its job to be diplomatic - and embrace more courageously the battle for values and for human rights.
I abstained, despite the fact that the motion for a resolution contains positive elements, because important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were voted down and, as a result, the content was inadequate. The European Union must support efforts by the UN to ensure that human rights are respected throughout the world. It must take centre stage in this sort of initiative, all the more so nowadays, when infringements tend to be the rule under autocratic regimes which engage in 'capitalist violence' in order to impose their antisocial policies. The European Union must re-examine its relations with the state of Israel, taking serious account of Israel's military operations on Palestinian territory and of attacks on the rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to eventually acquire its own homeland. The European Union must resign from US 'democracy export' campaigns and create a framework for international relations with respect for the rules of international law and an enhanced role for the UN.
The Swedish Conservatives have today, 25 February 2010, voted in favour of the joint resolution on the 13th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council,. We would, however, like to point out that we believe that EU Member States should be urged to denounce violations of human rights in general and that it is regrettable that the United Nations Human Rights Council has not managed to deal sufficiently quickly with serious human rights situations in other countries not mentioned in the resolution either, for example Cuba, as well as other countries.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the United Nations Platform for Action for Gender Equality, which identifies key steps required for the European Union to meet strategic objectives on equality between women and men. There is a clear need for the Commission to step up efforts to compile comparable data on critical indicators for the follow-up to the Platform for Action, and to translate it into regular reviews of gender mainstreaming initiatives across a range of policy fields. It is especially important to monitor, and act on, the gender dimension of poverty, violence and the needs of girl-children. The follow-up to the Commission's Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men 2006-2010 must take into consideration the long-term consequences of the economic crisis and climate change in a society that is getting older and ethnically more diverse. Sexual and reproductive health and rights need to be acknowledged and furthered in Europe and at a global level. The European Union should now become party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, a legal step made possible by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.
I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council. The new institutional structure of the EU offers a unique opportunity to increase the coherence, visibility and credibility of the EU within the UN Human Rights Council. The activities of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy will also help to enhance the EU's ability to cooperate with countries from other regional blocs, with a view to stopping human rights violations, including violence directed specifically against women and children.
I am sure that the Member States of the EU are opposed to any attempt to undermine the concepts of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights. I expect that there will be active participation from the Member States in the annual interactive debate on the rights of persons with disabilities and the annual meeting on the rights of the child ... I would like to stress the importance of the 13th session of the UNHRC, which will be attended by ministers and other high-level representatives. Its agenda includes the economic and financial crisis and the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training. Finally, I welcome the re-engagement of the United States in UN bodies and its subsequent election as a member of the UNHRC, as well as its constructive work on freedom of expression in the 64th UN General Assembly.
We very much agree with the concept mentioned in the report, regarding the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights. However, based on these same assumptions, it is necessary to stress the irreconcilable contradiction between this view and the severe attack on the rights of workers and of the people, caused by the crisis of the capitalist system, including high unemployment rates, increased poverty and increasingly difficult access to good quality public services at affordable prices. Unfortunately, the majority in Parliament did not take proper account of this contradiction.
I voted in favour of the resolution on the 13th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, firstly to very warmly welcome the initiative to have the UNHCR put at the top of its agenda the impact of the global economic and financial crises to the realisation of all human rights. I also think it is important to highlight the need for a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the fact-finding mission on the conflict in Gaza and Southern Israel; it is imperative, in this regard, that the recommendations included in the Goldstone report be implemented. Finally, Iran's candidacy in the UNHRC elections to be held in May 2010 is of particular concern and must be followed up with strong EU action to prevent countries with a dubious human rights record from being elected.
Now all of a sudden, we have the added issue of Iran's candidacy. This is a provocation. This state, this government, this president, scorn the rights of men and women. At least 346 of the country's citizens, including minors, were either hanged or stoned to death in 2008. The trials there are farcical. Torture is used. There is a complete absence of freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of the press. Minorities, particular the Baha'is, are persecuted. Since the presidential elections of June 2009, any form of demonstration has been bloodily and systematically repressed. I could go on.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the final text of the resolution, among other reasons, because it kept the paragraphs related to the joint study related to the existence of secret detention centres, the necessary implementation of the recommendations of the Goldstone report and the ICC, and because it included also the amendment on Western Sahara tabled by GUE. I am also glad that the request made by Brok to have a separate vote on the paragraph dealing with the defamation of religion was rejected and that the paragraph stated as follows:
EU policy on respect for human rights is one of the most important values which we are putting into practice. Community policy on respect for human rights includes protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. It attaches significant importance to support for the rights of women, children and national minorities and, in particular, to combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination. It is very dangerous when legislation which discriminates against minorities is used to violate their right to freedom of religion or when it restricts their access to education and employment, thus restricting their right to work, which, in turn, restricts their right to have an adequate standard of living. The Union's work in this area to date gives us the right to demand respect from others for high standards in the field of democracy and human rights.
On the subject of human rights, at all levels and in all areas of the EU, it must be stressed that our duty as MEPs is not just to criticise and prepare resolutions on third countries, but to also closely observe EU Member States, paying attention to even the slightest negative phenomena which violate human rights. In cases where human rights are violated, the European Parliament prepares a resolution which is addressed to the appropriate country. Before we criticise others, we must first stop human rights violations within the EU, and then we will be able to criticise others and try to help them as much as possible.
I did not support this resolution because it fails to highlight the importance of the human rights of Christian minorities in the Middle East. I regret the lack of courage shown when it comes to condemning the attacks on Christian minorities in the Middle East and to referring this problem to the Human Rights Council. The General Assembly of the United Nations declared 2009 as the 'International Year of Human Rights Learning', and the EU has declared 2010 as the 'European Year for Combating Poverty'. We should remember that the UN has recognised extreme poverty as being a violation of human rights. In the marble of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe buildings, we have engraved the leitmotif of 17 October - the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty: 'Wherever men and women are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are violated. To come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our solemn duty. Father Joseph Wresinski'. Our resolution fails to express our deep concern about extreme poverty as a violation of human rights. That is why I am inviting the members of the European Fourth World Committee to send a letter along these lines to the delegates of the UN General Assembly expressing Parliament's concern in this area.
I voted in favour of the resolution for the Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality. Fifteen years after the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the European Parliament is debating today the progress made globally in terms of gender equality. Equal opportunities for men and women is one of the European Union's fundamental values. Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union highlights a number of values shared by Member States: pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and gender equality. Even though considerable progress has been made in certain areas and industrial sectors, there are still inequalities which persist. In this respect, the European Union must continue to make efforts to resolve these issues. Equality must be promoted in every area. At European level, when devising strategies for combating the economic crisis and the impact of climate change, the European Commission must also take into account the effect these strategies have on women. The resolution encourages the development of the strategies and instruments required to establish the situation on gender equality devised by the European Institute for Gender Equality.
We regret the lack of timely, reliable, comparable data, at both regional and EU level, for the indicators decided on for the follow-up to the Beijing Platform for Action, including women and poverty, violence against women, institutional mechanisms, women and armed conflict and the girl child. The Commission must develop further the annual review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and use the indicators and analytical reports effectively as a contribution to different policy fields, as well as a basis for new initiatives aimed at achieving gender equality. We would like to reiterate the need for systematic implementation and monitoring of gender mainstreaming in legislative, budgetary and other important processes, and of strategies, programmes and projects in different policy fields.
At present, there is a distinct lack of data on gender equality, violence against women and institutional mechanisms. It is very important that the Member States cooperate as closely as possible with the European Institute for Gender Equality, one of whose tasks is work with comparable data. The institute will keep statistics, research will be carried out, the goal of which will be to provide analyses of gender equality matters and studies will be carried out into data indicator statistics and data explanation. The aims laid down in the institute's work programme should particularly help implement the indicators set out in Beijing.
However, gender equality can never for an instant mask the natural, social and cultural difference between the sexes; equal rights are not the same thing as equal treatment. Men and women need to be treated fairly, giving them the same rights but taking their respective needs into account. In the case of women, this is particularly pertinent in areas such as maternity support, the reconciliation of work and family life and special protection against crimes that are mainly committed against women and children, such as sexual exploitation, human trafficking or abuse.
Gender equality is a fundamental principle of the European Union, and is enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Thus, the Union has a specific mission of promoting and mainstreaming equality between men and women. There is no doubt that the unfortunate situation of gender discrimination continues to exist today, in both developing and developed countries - and, specifically, in the European Union - at all social, economic and cultural levels. To effectively combat this phenomenon, it is vital to ensure that there are effective mechanisms for identifying problems and collecting information without coming up against obstacles or political constraints, so as to establish causes and consequences in a clear and sustained way in order to effect a complete response. This structural problem is an obstacle to progress and the development of communities in particular, and humanity in general.
The Swedish Conservatives have today, 25 February 2010, voted in favour of the resolution on Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality,. We would, however, like to emphasise that we do not believe that a chapter on equality should be included in the revision of the Lisbon Strategy 2010, as this is already covered in the Treaty of Rome and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. We would also like to point out that we believe that women should have power over their sexuality and reproduction. We believe in the ability of individuals to make decisions concerning their own lives; the EU should not interfere in this area. Increased equality is one of the EU's great challenges where Sweden's progress can inspire the other Member States of the EU.
I supported this resolution because, 15 years after the Beijing World Conference on Women, we have to acknowledge that too little progress has been made in relation to gender equality and that sexist stereotypes still persist in numerous areas such as employment, education and politics. I also supported the reference to the need to improve the sexual and reproductive health of women both in Europe and globally, and the encouragement that needs to be given to fathers to share family responsibilities, by taking advantage of parental leave, for example. Finally, with regard to the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, priority will have to be given to the gender equality goal, which will have to make a real impact in national social protection and inclusion measures.
We need to harmonise much more closely the Beijing objectives adopted within the framework of the United Nations and the implementation of the new EU roadmap for equality between men and women. In this European year for combating poverty and social exclusion, it is particularly important that women who are barely above the poverty line should receive suitable protection, since a change in their employment or family situation - such as job loss, divorce, widowhood and even childbirth - means that the danger of impoverishment threatens them exponentially. It is gratifying that the programme of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency places great emphasis, on the one hand, on following up on the implementation of the Beijing objectives, and, on the other, declares its intention to take a comprehensive approach to preventing and combating the poverty that affects women and children. These perspectives will, hopefully, also be addressed with due seriousness at the UN meeting scheduled for early March. In order to assess and review policies aimed at achieving equal opportunities between men and women, reliable data broken down by gender is necessary, and it would also be worth considering the introduction of standardised, common indicators for measuring gender inequality.
in writing. - I voted in favour of paragraph 9 of the resolution on the Beijing +15 UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality, upholding women's sexual and reproductive health and rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are based on universally recognised rights to bodily integrity, non-discrimination, and the highest attainable standard of health. These rights are enshrined in international law (including Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights where States Parties recognise 'the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health' and Article 12 of the Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women on eliminating 'discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, access to health care services, including those related to family planning'). Consensus documents (such as the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action and 1995 Beijing Platform for Action) also illustrated governments' commitment to (women's) sexual and reproductive rights. Many in my electorate in Romania share this perspective.
I voted for this resolution because it highlights the progress still to be made by the 189 states that are signatories to the Beijing Platform for Action if real equality between women and men is to be achieved. I particularly support the paragraph stressing that 'sexual and reproductive health and rights are an integral part of the women's rights agenda'. I would like to point out in this regard that, when my report on equality between women and men was adopted in 2009, the majority of MEPs supported the view that women had to have easy access to contraception and abortion.
in writing. - The Member States of the ECR have signed the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action. We therefore feel that for the EU to 'become a party to the Convention' as a whole is unnecessary and we oppose the EU acting in this State-like way. Whilst the ECR Group places great importance on equality between all people, we oppose further legislation at EU level; we believe the gender equality issue is best driven at national level with the involvement of civil society within local communities. For these reasons, we have voted against the resolution.
According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration. The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions. The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs' assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants' Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained.
Firstly, the sudden and belated discovery, in respect of the signing of the 2010 budget in December 2009, that the 20% limit for expenditure under 'heading 5' had been exceeded. The agreement to shift the problem from December to January, the desire not to publicise the budgetary burden of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the hasty manner in which the issue was raised, without any scope to demand, where necessary, more efficient use of the resources currently available, have led to a real distortion of the facts.
I voted against this report, because the EU budget continues to constitute a minimum percentage of European GDP (0.97%), which does not cover the need to strengthen weak economies and societies and finance enlargement. The need for a bold increase in the budget, to at least 5%, is becoming more urgent, especially in the current economic crisis, which has hit the entire European Union, in order to address social needs and stop public spending cuts. It is within this framework that the problems of operational needs and the harmonisation of expenditure by the European Parliament and the European Union need to be addressed.
The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee. It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs' assistants are paid. The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this. Certainly, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants' Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants. For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow. For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained from voting.
in writing. - I voted for the Maňka Report which is the first step in amending the 2010 European Parliament budget seeking additional budgetary and human resources to enable the European Parliament to fulfil its enhanced role. The additional resources include an increase in the monthly assistance allowance available to MEPs to support their increased legislative role under the Lisbon Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty puts the Parliament on an equal footing with the Council as colegislator accounting for some 95% of legislative procedures. It now includes such areas as freedom, security and justice, agriculture, fisheries, research and structural funds. Parliament's consent must also now be given for the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements which require detailed expert examination. It is essential that MEPs have the staff necessary to do this work as required.
We Swedish Social Democrats believe that those committees that will gain a heavier workload with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon need to be reinforced. This justifies an increase in staff for Parliament's and the groups' secretariats in these committees. However, we do not share the view that we MEPs need more staff. Above all, we would have liked to have seen Parliament's resources being increased by means of redistributions and measures to increase efficiency, rather than the total budget being increased.
The need for this budget has come about as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament is taking on new powers and new responsibilities. Our priority now is excellence in legislation. In order to secure this, it is important to provide the Members, committees and political groups with sufficient means. This amending budget fulfils legal and budgetary standards and good financial discipline. As the rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for this budget, I believe that budgetary discipline and trying to make savings is necessary now more than ever, throughout its implementation. I can therefore reaffirm the importance of developing a zero-based budget that will ensure further rigour and transparency, and I also appeal for information regarding Parliament's fixed expenditure as a matter of urgency. I must also insist on the need for long-term planning in buildings policy, with a view to ensuring budgetary sustainability.
Yesterday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Athens, and Greece was paralysed by a general strike in protest against the austerity plan imposed by the EU, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and the IMF. It is true to say that Greece has not always been as rigorous as it should have been in the management of its public accounts and EU funds. However, it is scandalous that the main virtue of this austerity plan should be that it reassures the markets, these same markets that are currently speculating on the Greek debt and which caused this turmoil. These same markets from which the States, thanks to your ultra-liberal laws, have to borrow at high rates of interest. At the same time, under the pretext of an alleged increase in workload due to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and of Parliament's supposed concern about the quality of its legislative texts, the MEPs are awarding themselves a 'small' budget increase to the tune of a few million euros so that staff can be recruited for the political groups! Therefore, apply your nit-picking checks to your own expenditure and be as rigorous as you insist the Member States must be! We will be voting against this text.
I voted for the Maňka report, although I did not agree with the budget increase in the secretarial allowance for MEPs. In her explanation of our vote, Mrs Trüpel, who is the responsible member on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, put it on record on behalf of the whole group that our vote in favour is conditional on there being an evaluation of the secretarial allowance before the increase is put into effect. I consider both the other points - namely the increase in posts for committees and groups - to be sensible and necessary as a consequence of Parliament's new legislative powers under the Treaty of Lisbon. We Members wish to and will take these powers very seriously and thereby do justice to our role as the only elected representatives of European citizens.
in writing. - The approval and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon have meant increased responsibility for Parliament, with the administrative burden that that entails. Given that legislative excellence is a priority for Parliament, the Members need to be given the material and human resources to make this a reality. This new budget must, however, respect the utilisation rates of the values under heading 5 (administrative provisions) of the multiannual financial framework (MFF), which were fixed at 20% of the value of that heading, so as to maintain budgetary sustainability.
I voted against this report as it envisages an increase in the envelope for recruitment of and allowances for assistants by EUR 1 500 per month from 1 May 2010. Fortunately, an amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance provides for an evaluation of the system of allowances, in force since the 2009 elections, as it currently exists. Yet the increase in the secretarial assistance allowance is to take effect unconditionally, with no obligation to take account of the results of this evaluation. The report also envisages a strengthening of the parliamentary committees and the political groups. This operation costs EUR 13.3 million on an annual basis, EUR 8.832 million of which is for assistants' allowances.
This is a bad decision. It damages the reputation of this institution. It has not been thought through. No thought has been given to any further consequences. Where are the new assistants to be accommodated? Will it be in a new building? Will yet more costs be incurred? In addition, I fear that this money will be used in large part for the recruitment of non-accredited assistants under national wage terms. That very system has given rise to dirty tricks in some cases. Now we may be leaving the door wide open to abuse. Therefore, I urge a clear evaluation of the existing system in advance; only then can we take an informed decision.
Therefore, the amending budget for the financial year of 2010 now has a value of EUR 1 616 760 399, which represents 19.99% of the initial heading 5, adopted at first reading, and the buildings reserve has been reduced from EUR 15 million to EUR 11 million. I would like to emphasise the importance of the report's inclusion of the establishment of a zero-based budget, which ensures greater budgetary sustainability, and the need for this to be in accordance with the annual legislative programme. For the aforementioned reasons, I voted in favour of the document, which will allow Parliament to be given sufficient means to cover the expenses related to its new role following the Treaty of Lisbon.
in writing. - The Greens/EFA Group gives conditional support to an increase in the secretarial assistance allowance at this stage of the procedure. For our group, the evaluation of the use of the secretarial allowance as asked for in the Maňka report is crucial. This evaluation should come in time for a decision by the budgetary authority on the corresponding amending budget later in spring. The group may reconsider its support for the increase in the assistants' allowance in view of the outcome of this evaluation and discussions within our group.
The report supports the EU common fisheries policy which, in the name of protecting fish stocks, has resulted in the destruction of a large number of small fishing boats in Greece and in numerous small and medium-sized fishing enterprises being ousted from the profession, in the condemnation of numerous coastal areas to abandonment and unemployment and in the concentration of activities in the hands of large fishing companies. The monopoly friendly nature of EU policy is illustrated by the fact that 2/3 of Community funds have been channelled to big business (fishing companies, fish farms, processing), while the remaining 1/3 has been given to poor and middling fishermen to break up their boats and leave the profession. Measures to replace/improve vessels have only benefited large companies. The report, like the Green Paper, apportions equal responsibility for the reduction in fish stocks to large fishing companies and small-scale coastal fisheries. It does not differentiate between the measures needed in fisheries areas and overlooks their individual peculiarities. The EU common fisheries policy serves the ambitions of the big fishing companies that will remain to plunder the wealth of the seas and supports big business in the fish farming sector. This policy, the only criterion for which is the profitability of capital, is resulting in the destruction of the marine environment and of ecosystems.
The fishing sector in Europe is experiencing hard times. Fishermen are losing their only source of livelihood, and this is particularly true in those EU regions where there are few social and economic alternatives. Therefore, I support wholeheartedly the Commission's proposal, set out in the Green Paper, that it is necessary to fundamentally and comprehensively reform fishing policy, thereby adapting this sector to the changing market. It is regrettable, but 27 years have passed since the creation of the common fisheries policy and this sector is not working as it should and problems are not being solved quickly enough. The problems of 2002 still remain and they have been aggravated even more by the latest events, linked to the economic crisis and the impact of climate change on fish stocks. The priorities of the reform of the common fisheries policy must remain the restoration of stocks, sustainable management and securing the subsistence level of fishermen. Fishing is very important to the whole of the EU, therefore it should not simply be seen as an activity, but as a sector which is a direct source of employment.
The promotion of a common interest among producer organisations in observing the principles advocated by the European Union is becoming a key element in reforming the fisheries policy. The European Union cannot expect Europe's fishing fleets to be resized naturally, based on economic realities. Their overcapacity, eight years after the global summit on sustainable development, and the continuing decline in fish stocks, are additional reasons for a far-reaching reform of the common fisheries policy. However, it must not be forgotten that there are whole communities located in the coastal regions of the European Union's states whose existence revolves around fishing. As is also mentioned in the report on the reform of the common fisheries policy, this activity is part of the cultural heritage and traditions which no one wants to see lost.
I voted against the report on the common fisheries policy, despite the fact that it contains a number of elements that represent a positive development compared with the current situation. Unfortunately, however, basic points of the report clash with the fact that marine resources are common public property which cannot be privatised and an amendment by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on this point was rejected. This particular report fails to combine the necessary protection of the marine environment, conservation of fish stocks and social and financial protection for fishermen, especially small-scale fishermen, with catastrophic consequences for the environment and viable fisheries and an adverse impact on both fishermen and consumers, who have to pay the final price for the product, with the profits benefiting large private companies rather than small-scale fishermen. The report does not succeed in taking real account of the various conditions prevailing in individual EU Member States and, consequently, does not succeed in making provision for the necessary, duly adjusted policies.
I wish to congratulate Mrs Patrão Neves on her excellent report on the reform of the common fisheries policy. The countless problems and challenges with the CFP were identified back in 2002, but have now been exacerbated by the economic and energy crises and by the damaging effects of climate change. If the CFP is to serve the interests of modern fisheries, it needs to introduce a set of thorough changes which will ensure a fair balance between the preservation of resources and the viability of the sector, opening the door to new management systems for the different types of fisheries within the EU.
I welcome the concern to decentralise and de-bureaucratise the CFP, and to regionalise fishery management within the limits set by the Treaty of Lisbon, and also the need to ensure that treatment is tailored to small-scale coastal fisheries and industrial fisheries, whilst respecting environmental, economic and social requirements. I would also stress the protection of the interests of Community fisheries. However, these require appropriate monitoring by national governments, which should make fisheries a strategic priority in order to ensure the economic and social viability of coastal communities.
I believe that plans need to be drawn up for managing and supporting the long-term recovery of fish stocks for all types of fishing and all geographical fishing zones within the European Union. Consideration must be given, first and foremost, to the huge differences which exist in Europe in terms of fishing. Greater responsibility must be given to fishing zones and improvements made to the traditional quota system. Europe needs to adopt a strong, joint approach to managing fisheries resources, which will include a continental and market dimension for the sector, as well as a catching sector and aquaculture, in accordance with the European Union's new integrated maritime policy and with its interest in sustainable growth in coastal regions.
We Swedish Social Democrats voted against the report on the Green Paper and the reform of the EU fisheries policy. The majority in Parliament rejected the prioritising of ecological sustainability and voted in favour of an amendment stating that our policy towards countries outside the EU should be governed by the interests of European fisheries. We find this unacceptable and therefore elected to vote 'no'. We are also sceptical about the fact that the European Parliament wants to provide more money for the common fisheries policy - this is something that we do not wish to be involved in, unless the purpose is to make a clear change to the policy.
I believe that it is urgent and vital for the European Union to engage effectively in ensuring better conditions of economic sustainability for fishermen, within a framework that can safeguard the specific features of each region and that recognises that a different approach is required for small-scale fisheries. It is worth pointing out the recommendation of concrete measures such as the reduction in the number of middlemen in the chain between the producer and the consumer. On the other hand, this reform cannot be isolated from the sustainable use of marine resources in a technical and scientific process of assessment that has been thoroughly checked, and which will contribute to the conciliation of the sector and have a bearing on quality and food security for consumers. Within the context of changing the capacity of fisheries, I would like to emphasise the impact of modernising equipment on the professional dignity and safety of fishermen in a sector where loss of life is common.
The rejection by a majority in Parliament of the proposals that we tabled here, turning down the privatisation of fisheries resources, is indicative of the route that it is attempting to follow with the forthcoming reform of the CFP. Parliament not only fails to reject the Commission's proposal for the creation of (private) property rights for access to use a public good to be imposed; it also opens the way for that intention to be made official. This is an option that does not safeguard the sustainability of resources and it will inevitably lead to a concentration of activity among entities with greater economic and financial power all over the EU, seriously threatening small-scale, coastal fisheries that, in the case of Portugal, represent more than 90% of the fleet.
We did note some positive points in the report, some of which corresponded with the proposals that we tabled, but we cannot fail to note that overall, the report sticks to a markedly liberal approach, and one which greatly limits the sovereignty of the Member States over their marine resources. It also fails to provide a thorough response to one of the main issues that the sector is facing: income from work. We can but point out the rejection of the proposals that we tabled, aimed at improving marketing in the sector, which would increase the remuneration for the fishermen's work.
in writing. - The report contained many good and important elements and there is a consensus that the centralised, one-size-fits-all model of the CFP has been a disaster. A number of amendments tabled by myself were successful and thus, the report recognises relative stability, the need to incentivise conservation efforts and the success that has been national control within the 12-mile zone. However, the report goes on to state that historical rights should be reviewed. Fisheries management must be returned to the fishing nations; those fishing nations must not lose their historical rights. I therefore voted against a report which invites an attack on such fundamental traditional rights of access to fish stocks.
A fundamental and comprehensive reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is to be welcomed, particularly with a view to the sustainable management of fish resources. This is to be enabled by refining and standardising the framework conditions, better controls on the part of the Member States, and simplifying the decision-making system. Even though Austria, as an inland country, is not directly concerned, the steadily growing consumption of sea fish is influencing fishing. We need practical and efficient solutions that offer the sector a basis for sufficient viability through good stock conditions, ensure supply to consumers and, at the same time, guarantee the maintenance of species diversity and safeguard the marine ecosystem as a whole.
in writing. - This report is a broad document that covers all the aspects of the CFP, from aquaculture to angling, from the Baltic Sea to fisheries agreements with third world countries. The Greens are happy about many of the amendments to the report that we managed to get accepted, such as fundamental principles on demands for sustainability on those that will have the right to fish, demands of environmental impact assessments on fisheries operations, the statement that the EU should not compete with local fishermen under the fisheries agreements, but only be allowed to fish from a surplus of fish, and also the motion to all EU institutions to put illegal fishing on top of the international agenda in all relevant fora, to protect the oceans as well as food security. Unfortunately, there were also some completely unacceptable and contradictory paragraphs approved in the final text, such as the objective of the external parts of the CFP is to protect and promote European fisheries interests, that ecological sustainability should not be prioritised over social and economical sustainability and that all policy areas should contribute to fulfilling the CFP's objectives. This is why the Green group could not support the report, but abstained.
The fisheries industry is very important in the EU. It is therefore vital that the new CFP takes account of the rational and responsible management of resources, and that it concerns itself with protecting marine resources and maintaining the way of life of those who have always earned their living from fishing. The new CFP needs to be capable of resolving productivity problems within the sector, stabilising markets and ensuring a good standard of living for families who are dependent on this sector. However, this sector should be analysed as a whole, not in sections, so that we can integrate all its problems and vicissitudes in order to resolve them to the satisfaction of all those involved, and overcome the main problems affecting it: overfishing, overcapacity, overinvestment and wastage.
That fishing has a long tradition in Europe, and, one hopes, also will have in the future, is welcome. Developments in these last few years certainly indicate that working in this sector of the economy is becoming fundamentally less attractive. The reason for this is that groups of companies with their masses of fish products are pushing retail prices down so far that small fishing businesses cannot compete. As a result of these circumstances, this sector is increasingly becoming the province of workers from third countries. On account of the fact that this motion for a resolution does not sufficiently deal with this issue, I voted against it.
in writing. - I abstained in the final vote on the Neves Patrão report because it contained both positive and negative paragraphs. In one side, agrees that priority access should be given to those who fish in the most environmentally sustainable way, leading to fewer discards, more jobs and less energy use, and stresses that the right to fish must be based on environmental and social criteria, rather than on who caught the most fish 30 years ago. It is years of overfishing that has led to the current crisis, so it is absurd to let the same fleets continue the damage. Other positive points include making ecological sustainability the basic premise of the CFP and the recognition that EU fleets must no longer overfish in the waters of developing countries. Unfortunately, less constructive ideas are also in the report, such as a refusal to accept the destructive influence of subsidies. The report also declares the CFP to be the dominant policy in the EU, with environment and development policies being subservient to it. It is this 'preserve the fishing industry at all costs' attitude that has led to the destruction of the marine ecosystem and the fishing communities that depend upon it.
The German members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted differently from the group as a whole on two points. The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The FDP members voted against, because a radical devolution of fisheries policy such as proposed in the motion with the transfer of powers and responsibility to Member States and to local decision makers cannot be reconciled with the European common fisheries policy. The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level. FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans. This concerns the basis for quota allocation.
In the light of the structural problems identified, namely overfishing, underinvestment, overcapacity of the fishing fleet and waste (how many tonnes of fish are discarded into the sea every day because they are not fit for consumption?), reform of the CFP must be a top priority. Clearly, any reform must take account of the individual features of the various fishing areas and avoid at all costs a one-size-fits-all management model. The fishing techniques and vessels used in the North Sea are quite different from those used in the Gulf of Gascony. That is why the reform proposed by the Commission, which is based on regionalisation and which was adopted by Parliament this afternoon, is essential.
in writing. - The Commission's Green Paper on this issue was a damning indictment and an honest recognition that the common fisheries policy has not worked. On the contrary, it has contributed to a variety of problems which continue to have economic, social and environmental impacts. Only two weeks ago, this House voted in favour of suspending international trade in bluefin tuna because of the critically low stocks - a situation which is yet another sign that our current levels of fishing are unsustainable and have serious consequences for biodiversity and the future of the fishing sector. We must recognise that a new approach is needed. A decentralised policy with more funding will allow different regions to adapt and respond to their own circumstances - something that the previous 'top-down' policy prevented. This should lead to better management of stocks and have a positive effect on the marine environment. I fully support the Commission's commitment to whole-scale and fundamental reform, which has been rightly backed by the Committee on Fisheries. It is vital that we act to ensure that the European Union implements a truly sustainable fishing policy in order to protect stocks, the environment, and European jobs in the long term.
I abstained from the vote on the report on the common fisheries policy as it contains too many points that not only conflict with a number of other points in the report but also run counter to my political perspective on European fisheries policy. On the one hand, the report says that European fishing fleets may no longer overfish the waters of developing countries, but on the other, it says that the common fisheries policy always takes precedence over environmental and development policies. This position is patently at variance with the Treaty of Lisbon, Article 208 of which states that our foreign policy must not undermine the development objectives of poor countries. The policy proposed by Parliament most certainly benefits Europe, but outside European waters, Europe is championing only its own fishing fleets and not the local fish stocks and fishermen. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has therefore abstained. In addition, whilst the report does recognise that there is a serious problem of overfishing and that sustainability must form the starting point for the policy, it fails to recognise that fleet capacity and the subsidy and quota systems are at the root of this problem. That explains our abstention.
The report on the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy, which we adopted today, revises the economic, social and environmental aspects of this policy, with the aim of redefining the approach to resolving the remaining problems within the sector. I would like to reiterate that priorities such as greater efficiency in managing fishery resources and a financial support strategy for those who work in this sector, along with a guarantee of sustainability in the sector through the preservation of species, are essential in this reform, and they must be implemented at regional level. This document insists on reforms needed for the fishing industry, and which are enormously important in the outermost regions, particularly Madeira, where this activity is greatly important in local development and in the lives of the local people.
I have several things to say at the beginning of the session. In opening this plenary session of the European Parliament, once again I have to inform you of several tragic natural disasters which have occurred in recent days. Today, there was an earthquake in Turkey in which at least 57 people died. Last week, there was also an earthquake in Chile, which claimed nearly 300 victims, and storms raging across Europe caused the deaths of over 60 people, most of whom were citizens of France. Furthermore, we should not forget Haiti, where the latest toll of victims of the earthquake in January is now in excess of 300 000 people. In all these cases, I have sent condolences and expressions of sympathy, on behalf of the European Parliament, to the victims' families. Every unexpected and premature death is, more than anything, a tragedy for the families concerned, but when victims are numbered in tens or hundreds of thousands, it is also a tragedy for entire nations and the whole world. Let us join in solidarity with the families and also send expressions of solidarity to the countries which have been hit by such a tragedy.
I would also like to inform you about something else, about another theft which has taken place. The theft was suffered by a Member in the proximity of the European Parliament's premises. For quite some time now, I have been engaged in talks with representatives of the authorities in Brussels, and also with the Belgian authorities. Our fellow Member, Mrs Durant, is acting as go-between in these talks, because she knows the situation in Brussels and in Belgium very well. Our current plan, together with the Commission and the European Council, is that we want to create a special zone around the premises of all three institutions, in which security will be provided not only by the authorities in Brussels, but also by the Belgian Government and the central authorities in Belgium. Intensive talks are under way on this matter. Meetings were held about it last week, straight after the theft, and more will be held in the next few days. An official meeting with the police has been arranged for 22 March. I would also like to tell you that we are working very hard to improve security around the premises of the European Parliament, as well as other European institutions, not just Parliament. We are treating this as a matter which concerns us all.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again moved for the subject of the licensing of the genetically modified potato Amflora to be put on the agenda for various reasons. After the Commissioner for Health became responsible for the licensing of genetically modified organisms, in my opinion, citizens thought that we would now approach the licensing of such GMOs with greater care. The opposite is the case. So soon after the Commission took office, I consider it a scandal that by licensing the potato, the Commissioner for Health has explicitly ignored the concerns of the World Health Organisation.
Moreover, in the previous legislative period, time and again, there was great disagreement between the Council and the Commission on the licensing procedures, because many Member States did not agree with the licensing offensive that Commission President Barroso himself promoted. We had agreed to develop another prudent procedure for licensing. Where is this procedure now? Since the majority of citizens are against these genetically modified organisms, we have a duty to hold a debate this week on this licensing and the offensive that is perhaps still trundling towards us.
Women deserve more, today, because we do want, after all, to save Europe from demographic collapse, but this must not be done at the expense of women. Mothers of three or four children must have the possibility of employment and promotion on the same principles as men. Widely available nurseries and kindergartens, as well as jobs, are only one of the ways of achieving this objective. On the other hand, however, mothers who wish to remain at home with their children should also have the opportunity to do this, for example, by a suitable system of taxation based on the whole family, and not only on the two spouses.
This year, one theme of International Women's Day is women's solidarity and assertiveness the world over: an important theme at a time of economic crisis. It provides guidance for men and women to work together towards a better future for ourselves and our children, as only together can we ensure that women and men are equal not only before the law but also in their day-to-day lives and in economic and social life. After all, women make up approximately 50% of the world's population but their earnings account for only 10% of worldwide income. Only 5% of world leaders are women. Women account for 75% of the world's poor. This can, and must, be greatly improved.
Yet this is not just about poverty. Looking at other parts of the world, in particular - large parts of Asia, for example - boys are more highly regarded than girls; they yield more for the family. This results in daughters being abandoned and even female foetuses being aborted. Sadly, trafficking in women is also a familiar and frequent phenomenon. In Africa, many young women and girls are victims of war and rape. There are many underlying cultural causes and these too must be accorded great importance if the position of women is to be improved. Women and girls suffer oppression, particularly in Muslim countries, where there are underlying religious causes.
Yet there is also a great deal of work still to be done closer to home, and indeed even in our group, particularly with the support of our Chair, Mr Daul. I should like to devote my closing remark to ourselves here in the European Union. It all starts at a young age, during a child's education, and access to education is still not guaranteed for girls in Europe. The access rate should be 100% in our civilisation. This should be an important objective of the new EU 2020 strategy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a society in which men and women do not have equal rights in work and life is not a democratic and humane society. The basic prerequisite for justice in society is that it is administered regardless of a person's gender. That is something we men take for granted, not so women, even in Central European societies, not by a long shot. That is seen most clearly in one of the greatest scandals which I believe we must rid ourselves of as soon as possible. As Parliament, we could make a significant contribution to this.
Really, how can a society rightly maintain it is equal if men and women receive different pay for the same work in the same place? Nowhere is the discrimination of women in this society more frequently accepted without comment than in places of work, where women do the same work as men, to some extent, under far more extreme living conditions, and receive largely 30% or 40% less pay for it. We must rid the EU of this shame. If we here in Europe are to send out a message on International Women's Day, let it be equal pay for equal work in the same workplace, for both men and women. That is a central requirement of social justice.
We have acknowledged that the Commission is making an effort. We can see that today, the European Charter on Women's Rights is about to get off the ground. That is good and we welcome it. However, we are a little disappointed and I ask you to pass this on to Mrs Reding and Mr Barroso. We would have liked this launch to have been more than a formal statement; we would also have liked the promise that was originally made to have been kept, namely that Parliament will be involved and that the agencies of civil society must be involved. Now this has not happened. We can still make up for this. However, we would appreciate it if there was more than simply a formal statement and the institutions cooperated to help rectify the particular example that I have just mentioned. My fellow Member, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, has mentioned other examples.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am going to start by saying that this was a speech I did not expect to be making until a few moments ago, but it is important that we celebrate International Women's Day, and especially this one, some 100 years since this celebration was first proposed. It should be a day, yes, to celebrate how far women have come, but, yes, also to raise awareness about how much further we still have to travel in terms of equality.
The other issue that this Parliament is working on this week is human trafficking and violence against women. Last week, I visited an exhibition in my constituency at home with an exhibition of paintings and photographs of women who had been trafficked from a country next to our Union - Moldova - into our Union. Some estimates say that women - and, indeed, men - are being trafficked at a rate as high in numbers as was comparable with the whole of the African slave trade in 350 years, but women are the main victims. If we, as a European community, cannot do something about this and deal with the women who are the victims of that trade, then it would be a poor thing if we do not make progress on this day.
International Women's Day, 8 March. I have celebrated this day for as long as I can remember, like my mother and grandmother before me. On 8 March, I sometimes become disheartened thinking of everything that must still be done for men and women to enjoy genuine equality of opportunity. There are so many women for whom violence is a day-to-day reality, so many women living in poverty, so many women having to single-handedly care for their children and parents; and so few women making it to the top in business, academia and politics.
The European Union can make an important contribution, but only if it moves beyond fine words. The fight for equal rights has already been burdened by far too many fine words for far too long, and these have been joined by several more. On Friday, the Commission presented a Charter of Women's Rights containing very many fine words. I harbour a very healthy scepticism about its implementation. This scepticism is reinforced by the fact that the European Parliament and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were not consulted, as Mr Schulz has already said. Since this is Commissioner Reding's first act as the Commissioner responsible for equal opportunities, however, I am more than willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.
The kind of initiatives with which she accompanies her fine words are what counts. If, in this period, she presents us with a directive to combat violence against women, a directive on paternity leave, strong measures to combat discrimination against women, strong measures to increase the female employment rate - for example, by improving the mutual compatibility of working hours and school hours - and quotas for women in top jobs, at least in her own ranks of the Commission, if the Commission translates its fine words into genuine action, my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I will be the first to stand up and show our appreciation.
If we want to see change, we need to work together: the Commission, the Council and the left and right in this House. Today, 8 March, is not only International Women's Day but also my son's birthday; he is two years old today. I hope with all my heart that, in 30 years' time, he will live in a Europe where he and his wife - or husband - share child care responsibilities equally, and where women have just as much chance of becoming a professor, CEO or European Commissioner. In the coming years, his mum will be doing her very best to achieve this, and fortunately I am not the only one.
Mr President, today we are celebrating International Women's Day and it is 15 years since the UN platform for women's rights was established. Halfway through the review which is now under way in New York, I and the other members of the delegation from the European Parliament can only say that women all over the world will have to content themselves with the status quo. Despite the positive resolutions recently adopted by Parliament, the Tarabella report and the resolution on Beijing +15, unfortunately, the UN meeting has not yet produced any results.
Before he was elected, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, promised to draw up a Charter of women's rights. Today, we have had the chance to read the Commission's document. I and my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, are deeply concerned about the weakness of the content and the way in which the charter has been drawn up. There is a major risk that it will not be worth the paper it is written on. Parliament, the national bodies and the European voluntary organisations were not involved in and did not contribute to the charter and, of course, the citizens of Europe did not take part in the process either.
(HU) I would like to point out to my fellow Members that it is a grave mistake to talk in general about European women and the rights of women living in the European Union without taking into account the second-class position of women in Central and Eastern Europe's post-communist new Member States. The time has come for the EU to go on a fact-finding mission to investigate their particular lack of rights and, on the basis of the results, to remedy the existing serious discrimination among women inside Europe itself.
Allow me to mention just two areas. Both are related to globalisation, the neoliberal economy, liberalised free trade and their drawbacks. The first is that multinational companies as well as large, EU-registered European firms, use different standards for labour law and occupational health. I am thinking, for instance, of large retailers, hypermarkets, such as those on both sides of the border between Austria and Hungary. The same company applies different standards concerning breaks, lunch time and notices of termination. They keep Eastern European, in this case Hungarian, female employees practically in slavery.
The second area, completely unexplored, is the migration of women within the European Union. Women in a second-class position in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Hungarians, seek employment as domestic staff in the West, living as servants, as economic refugees, who often had to leave behind their children. From the point of view of their rights and dignity, their situation is much more like that of women in Third World developing countries than that of their sisters in Western Europe, who are fellow citizens of EU Member States. This calls for urgent redress.
(RO) On 8 February 2010, Romania accepted the invitation extended by the President of the United States to participate in the development of the US anti-missile defence system. This is proof of the confidence placed in my country, bearing in mind as well the professionalism which has been demonstrated by the Romanian army in Afghanistan and Iraq. Three batteries each comprising eight missiles will be stationed on Romanian territory. According to the timetable agreed with the US side, this defence system is intended to be operational as of 2015.
(ES) Mr President, a Spanish Central Criminal Court judge has confirmed what many of us were already aware of, namely that Hugo Chávez, the President of Venezuela, cooperates with ETA and FARC terrorists. This proves that Mr Chávez is in cahoots with terrorists, that he gives sanctuary to murderous terrorists on Venezuelan soil, and that he helps them by bestowing official positions in the Venezuelan Government upon them. Essentially, Mr Chávez is cooperating with ETA criminals.
I would also remind Mr Rodríguez Zapatero's government, which currently holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union, that there is no point in being friendly and wishy-washy with Mr Chávez as it has been to date. There is no point either in displays of affection, or in friendly gestures and cooperation, because when the Spanish Government goes back on its word and humbles itself before Mr Chávez as it has done recently, this is tantamount to punishing the victims of terrorism, disdaining the Spanish justice system and thereby punishing freedom and democracy.
As a Co-Vice President of EuroLat, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that with some of these countries, there is a risk of accelerating negotiations whilst neglecting important points concerning human rights and the respect of human rights in various regions. For example, in Colombia, assassinations of trade unionists continue to happen practically on a daily basis. In Honduras, with whom we are negotiating an agreement, a government remains in place that is simply the product of a military coup d'état which took place last year. In Guatemala, there are similar problems, not relating to human rights but concerning certain aspects of the agreements, which are being overlooked.
Mr President, it being International Women's Day, I wanted to raise a particular female health issue which persistently remains a Cinderella issue. I stood here two, maybe three years ago talking about a silent, unseen, painful and debilitating female illness - endometriosis: an illness which destroys lives, families and fertility; you see, some women do not even have the chance to be mothers. Maybe it is because it is about women's menstruation that we do not want to talk about it; do not even want to name it. So I will say it again - endometriosis.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, important Czech media reported last week that the German transport police have introduced much stricter checks for Czech drivers on the German side of the border. According to the reports, the checks are more frequent and substantially more thorough. According to witnesses, the situation is made worse by the fact that some people even have to provide urine samples during the checks, under conditions that are tantamount to an affront to human dignity. It is not, therefore, a matter of routine roadside checks combined with the inspection of travel documents or documents relating to the technical condition or origin of the vehicle. Czech citizens travelling freely within the Schengen area should not be considered as second class citizens. They are fully-fledged, equal and sovereign citizens of a Member State of the European Union and they must be treated as such. Mr President, I would like to ask you to pass this information on to the relevant authorities so that they can examine it properly and arrange the necessary remedy.
Obesity is a disease, not a problem. Each Member State should face the challenge and provide efficient support to this population group. According to the World Health Organisation, the statistics on obesity in the whole of Europe - not just the EU - are staggering, reaching epidemic proportions. If no action is taken, there will be an estimated 150 million obese adults - 20% of the population - and 15 million obese children and adolescents - 10% of the population - in the region by 2020. We must therefore strengthen the voice of obese and overweight patients.
(HU) Slovakia's language law has been the object of numerous critical comments lately. I would now draw your attention to the opinion of the European Commission's Legal Service. It states that the language law and its implementing regulations are not, in their present form, compatible with fundamental rights and the pertinent documents of the Council of Europe, or even with Slovakia's law for the protection of minorities. The opinion deplores the lack of reasonableness and proportionality in the language requirements. It considers that the law endangers the free movement of workers, one of the greatest achievements of European integration, and is also a threat to the functioning of the European Union's integrated internal market In addition, the amended language law is declared by the Legal Service to contravene the Audiovisual Media Services Directive as well as Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which addresses the freedom to provide services. The report states that the section on health institutions could, in practice, lead to discrimination, and that as far as fundamental rights are concerned, the rules protect the State's interests far more than the rights of individuals. I request that the Commission takes the necessary steps to ensure that Community law continues to prevail without fail.
Romania, too, is part of this trend, as a result of the economic crisis which has hit the business sectors in which men are predominantly employed. However, wage discrimination between women and men exists on the labour market. This is why it is important for the legislative package envisaged by the Commission to include targets relating to the elimination of these gender pay gaps, in order to encourage greater participation by women in the labour market. This legislative package must also feature in the European Union's 2020 strategy.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recently, there has been yet another environmental disaster in Italy, on the River Lambro and the River Po. Also recently, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg condemned Italy for endangering public health with their illegal waste disposal and their inability to control the collection of waste in Campania. An increase in cases of leukaemia has been reported recently in Taranto through the Ilva steelworks, as well asbestos removal in schools in Crotone and dioxins in Campania. It is an ongoing environmental disaster.
(MT) The diplomatic incident between Switzerland and Libya has escalated and is having very serious consequences for many European Union citizens who want to travel to Libya but who are being denied entry. In particular, adverse consequences are being suffered by workers who earn their living in Libya, as well as European investors who are being prevented from sending their workers there. In the meantime, workers who are already in Libya are trying to remain there for as long as possible in order to cover for those who still cannot enter Libya. The European Union has nothing to do with this incident and has found itself hostage to an issue between two third countries. I therefore appeal to the European Union to take all possible measures to solve this issue as soon as possible.
In developing a harmonised European pilot's licence, the European Aviation Safety Agency is about to wipe out the IMC rating, leaving many private pilots unable to fly unless they can guarantee cloudless skies for the entirety of their trip. This is a bit like guaranteeing that England will win the World Cup on a penalty shootout. After losing visual perspective, an untrained pilot has about 50 seconds to regain it before losing control of his aircraft. Therefore, the abolition of the IMC rating is a serious threat to the safety and future of private flying.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the Millennium Goals is the halving of world poverty. The Commission declared 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Sixteen per cent of Europeans - that is 79 million people - live below the poverty line. Seventy-nine million Europeans have to make ends meet on only 60% of the average income of their respective countries. If you are poor, you lose the opportunity to contribute to large parts of civil society. If you are poor, you suffer. The strategies for the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion must have an impact, even during the economic crisis.
The implementation of this law will be positive in areas devastated by urban development. It will not, however, be beneficial for the island of Formentera, because it requires the elimination of most of the island's tourist facilities, which means small family businesses will be seized. These facilities are the island's livelihood and have been legally established for between 30 and 40 years. By way of example, I could mention the Hotel Rocabella, which was the first hotel on the island, or the bar and restaurant known as the Blue Bar, which is internationally renowned and has helped to promote the island abroad. Seventy per cent of these facilities would be affected by the implementation of the aforementioned law, despite having been established legally when they were set up. All this law would do would be to permit seizure.
We therefore call for a fair demarcation system for the island of Formentera. I call on the Spanish Government to undertake a new demarcation, respecting private property, in line with the many rulings on the subject by the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. Never again should a law like this one with retroactive effect be drawn up. It is causing a great deal of damage. In particular, it should be borne in mind that all these facilities were built with respect for the environment. Furthermore, the coast is protected under national and local legislation. It is not possible to build within 300 metres of the coast or to increase the amount of hotel accommodation.
I believe that you will all agree with me that any person who breaks the law must pay. However, branding a whole nation like this is unacceptable. Indeed, the cases I have told you about here illustrate the deterioration in the climate of interethnic coexistence in countries with a tradition of democracy. These are displays of behaviour which are incompatible with the principles forming the foundation of the European Union and seriously spoil the European Community spirit, revealing the existence of a disgraceful iron curtain between the EU's citizens.
(DE) Mr President, once again, I would like to refer to the discussion in the last debate about one-minute speeches, in which we expressed our unease about the fact that it is obviously unclear when it is your turn and that when you have applied five times, it would be nice to know when your turn will be. Several colleagues submitted this request. At the time, it did apparently find a sympathetic ear. I fail to understand why we clearly are not learning from this and trying to make it easier for MEPs and to announce a clear procedure and keep to it. I put my name forward at 17:00 and cannot quite comprehend the procedure.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to give you an update of the Commission's work on reviewing the Package Travel Directive. At the time of the adoption of the directive in 1990, package holidays were the most common type of holidays. Since then, the market scene has changed significantly: the development of the Internet has made it possible for consumers to make their reservations directly from tour operators, air carriers and hotels. Furthermore, the rapid development of low-cost air carriers has revolutionised the supply of air transport. It has also enhanced competition and consumer choice in the travel market.
However, let me explain briefly the guiding principles of this work. First, a high level of protection is key if we want to make sure that consumers have confidence in their holiday purchases. Second, we must improve the functioning of the internal market for travel, in particular, since cross-border purchases are so frequent in this area. There is therefore a good case for more harmonisation of the relevant legislation in Member States. Finally, I think it is necessary to create a more level playing field for the businesses selling travel packages.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would firstly like to thank Commissioner Dalli for his promises and explanations that in 2011, he plans to undertake a revision of the Package Travel Directive dating from 1990. In terms of timing, it fits exactly in the current window, which we should use, because in the area of package travel, there is a whole range of issues when consumers are not properly informed about their rights. For example, on many websites, they are seduced into booking further offers through additional links, although these offers are not subject to the same protection mechanisms as the original ones. Here we are talking in particular about offers from low-cost airlines.
Fourthly, I believe - and this is something you have pointed out - that the assessment of the work of travel agents that varies from country to country also means that the cross-border provision of goods and services is being made very difficult for travel agents. In some countries, travel agents are liable just like package tour operators; in other countries, like mine for example, travel agents are only intermediaries. Here it would be preferable if, Europe-wide, we could at least agree on principles to facilitate the cross-border work of these travel agents.
We had a summer where it seemed that half of Europe was stranded on holiday, with airlines and travel agents going bust left, right and centre, and consumers being stranded away from loved ones, in countries that were not their own. It was clear that our laws had failed to properly protect consumers. We had several reports of passengers left with no information about when they could get home, no transparency about who was technically responsible for their situation, no phone number to call to get any information and no idea how to seek redress when they did get home.
The very fact that the law is still called the Package Travel Directive shows how outdated it is. The majority of consumers no longer use travel packages if they have found cheaper methods to go on holiday and see the world. Forty per cent of travellers in my own country, Ireland, do not bother to use packages, and I know this is replicated in many other Member States. Most people are now acting as their own travel agents with online booking on sites such as Tripadvisor, where they effectively become their own travel agent. Our laws now must reflect this change in consumer behaviour.
Now, however, we are talking about people travelling. That is an important right in Europe. We want mobility and freedom of movement for people and we have considered how we can ensure that. Twenty years ago, we had the directive regulating package tours, so that you could say to yourself 'I can go and explore other countries, see the beauties of other countries in Europe and know exactly that my rights protect me'. I will be informed in advance on what to expect, I will not be misled, the information must be right and if something does not work, I will receive compensation. That was 20 years ago.
As you said, Commissioner, a lot has changed since then. Now people are frequently booking on the Internet themselves and that then leads to loopholes in the system. Six months ago, we in the Transport Committee put a question to the Transport Commissioner because in the context of SkyEurope in Slovakia, we had the case of passengers with low-cost flights being stranded and not being transported further. Here it was actually a matter of a small loophole, which only affected those who had booked on the Internet without a credit card, but we do want people to be able to move freely in Europe, so that they can actually enjoy their holidays and are protected at the same time.
That means if we have loopholes in the system in terms of consumer protection and if we want to have a high standard of consumer protection for people in Europe, then we need a revision of this Package Travel Directive and we must also consider whether is it necessary - as my fellow Member has already mentioned - to have a special regulation for air passengers. We still have to discuss this and I am already looking forward to this with great expectation, as we want to be able to travel happily and safely, not just with animals, but, of course, also with our families.
In my opinion, passengers' rights must also be given a clear place in the directive. We do have to take sufficient account of the widely differing travel markets and differing holiday practices of consumers in the various Member States and of national case-law, of course, but harmonisation is required, as some concepts differ greatly, such as that of the tour operator, the agent and force majeure. I read in the consultation held by the Commission in 2007 that, in fact, very detailed feedback came in from the industry and the stakeholders, and so I ask myself what the problem is. Why are we not taking a decision now? There have also been calls for a kind of 'Travel Protection Label'. I should have liked to hear the Commissioner's opinion on this.
My final point concerns consumer information on prices. In most other sectors, the prices of services sold must be fixed and all inclusive, and this should also apply to travel services. Do you share this view? I should have liked to hear your views on this. Consumer rights must be clarified and stricter and more specific information requirements must apply in the case also of force majeure and a change in the range of travel services offered. Perhaps we should also consider introducing sanctions in the new directive. I hope the Commission will get to grips with this very soon and present us with a new proposal to discuss in this House.
The directive provides for fundamental means of consumer protection in the case of this type of package, which includes, principally, clear information about the packages being offered, the right to withdraw from the trip, compensation for services of lower standard than agreed and matters related to the insolvency of travel agencies. The problem is that in the last 20 years, there has been a complete change, both in the business model and in the pattern of consumer behaviour. I, myself, reserve most of my holiday trips via the Internet, very many people in Poland do the same, and in the European Union as a whole, the proportion of people who book their trips in this way has now reached 23%. There are countries, such as Ireland and Sweden, in which this proportion is as high as 40%, while almost two-thirds of the people who buy their holidays in this way do not realise that their interests are protected to a significantly lower degree than in the case of people who still buy holidays in the traditional way. We should fight this. I am pleased that the European Commission has, at last, raised this matter. I think 20 years is definitely too long.
(DE) Mr President, it is certainly not only differences in consumer protection, but also language differences which, until now, have made package tours to other Member States difficult. It is already 15 years since the European Union created fundamental basic protection as well as common procedures. In my opinion, the revision of these procedures must not get out of hand to the effect that they are subject to blanket standardisation in the name of the freedom to provide services. Travel needs themselves may vary from country to country. In general, I also consider it dangerous to measure everything by the same yardstick and campaign for enforced conformity everywhere.
The relatively satisfactory protection on package holidays will hopefully reassure those holidaymakers who are worried by the current negative headlines about Greece. Further announcements of strikes and protests could intensify the tendency to avoid other Mediterranean countries and the price collapse in relation to Greece. The state's debt crisis guarantees that this will be a critical year for Greek tourism, this we know. We can expect further strikes and protests. Hopefully, we will be spared the experience of discovering how travel protection would function in a case of national bankruptcy.
(HU) I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to the excellent objective mentioned during his hearing by the new Commissioner for Transport, Siim Kallas. To my mind, what I heard impressed me as an excellent principle: the free movement of people is one of the most important freedoms. To this end, we need to integrate the rights concerning the various modes of transport and incorporate them into one integrated charter. We need transparent systems. I would like to remark that this topic is included among the priorities of the Spanish Presidency. Why is this so important? it is important because the 20-year-old directive fails in every area to take into account the rights of people living with disabilities when they are travelling, even when they are travelling in groups. People living with disabilities are given no opportunities whatsoever. That is why I come back to my remark at the beginning. An integrated charter of passengers' rights would enable everyone - including people living with disabilities - to make use of transportation services, including group travel services. When this becomes a reality, we will truly be able to say that in the European Union, everyone can travel freely.
However, one thing I do think the Commission needs to think about is that there are other aspects that online consumers need to consider when they are shopping for travel; issues about the safety of the hotel, if they have young children, a safe swimming pool, for example, or the fire safety of the hotel, where my committee has done extensive work before. We need some proper indicators and markers there, which may be done by voluntary agreement, but I do think that this needs to be a wide-ranging and ambitious proposal. I get a sense from this that this is what you would like to do, and I think my committee would give you full support in coming up with such a proposal.
(MT) I would like to seize the opportunity to extend my welcome to Commissioner Dalli for this, his first session, in this Parliament. Indeed, as has already been stated, in recent years, there has been a substantial decline in travel bookings via travel agencies and an increase in package tours purchased online. What consumers do not realise is the fact that travel packages purchased online offer limited protection which is much lower than that provided by travel agencies. On the other hand, packages offered by agencies carry added costs in order to ensure compliance with this directive, while those purchased online do not carry such expenses. For these reasons, I believe that this directive is failing to protect consumers and is also creating an imbalance between operators in the travel industry. In order to ensure that this goes on, I appeal to the Commission to ensure equal protection on all packages irrespective of where such packages are purchased, so as to protect consumer rights which I know are of paramount importance for the Commissioner. Therefore, in the context of the revision of the directive, it should be ensured that definitions and terminology are clarified and updated; these include the definition of the consumer, the seller, the operator and essential contractual terms as well as, as was previously stated, the scope of the directive itself. In my opinion, it should be solely the operator who should comply with the directive, irrespective of how the package is sold, whether directly or via an agency. The operator should be the entity which sells or offers for sale at least one of the services included in the package in its name and which provides access by whatever means to the other services included in the package. I believe that this is a clear example of how I think Commissioner John Dalli will be working in the coming years; we have here clear proof of how the consumer will be given all the rights he merits.
(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the revision of the Package Travel Directive must respond to a series of new challenges in the area of tourism, especially in connection with the development of new technologies which have influenced ways of communicating and selling services. This mainly concerns sales over the Internet, which, among other things, has facilitated the dramatic growth in budget airlines. Every challenge has its opportunities and risks. The opportunities include greater flexibility and access to services for customers, while there is a possible risk in the insufficient level of protection for consumers.
Several months ago, the Committee on Transport and Tourism questioned the Commission in response to a series of bankruptcies of budget airlines. In these circumstances, we have witnessed the situation of passengers being stranded in airports without money and struggling to make alternative arrangements for their return journeys. This is only one of the examples of insufficient protection for consumers/airline passengers. The Commission should find a solution that will deal effectively with the situation in the foreseeable future to assist consumers and to boost confidence in the sector. The holiday season will begin in a few months and we certainly do not want to again experience problems similar to the collapse of the SkyEurope company last year.
Furthermore, I do not think it is necessary to extend the scope of the directive to include individual products or packages made up from products bought from different suppliers, for extending the directive's requirements to cover dynamic packages or affiliate sales would ultimately mean the consumer would pay in the form of a more expensive ticket. I do not imagine that, for example, a hotel stay bought after clicking on WIZZ Hotels just after buying a ticket from WIZZ Air would constitute a package which would come under the requirements of the directive. Consumers must know, in the case of a specific journey, if, and to what extent, they are protected by EU law. All the rest is a matter for the free market.
Freedom of travel and travel possibilities mean that purely in quantitative terms, there is a very different level of importance than perhaps twenty or more years ago. The possibilities offered by the Internet have also led to the emergence of a completely different kind of travel behaviour. It is, however, all the more important that, if they can afford a proper holiday during the crisis, our citizens can also return from this holiday satisfied. If they should experience a problem, then they should at least get back some of their hard earned money.
(EL) Mr President, it is true that widespread use of the Internet nowadays allows consumers to change the way in which they plan things, even down to their holidays. In other words, they have the facility, via the Internet, not to buy ready packages, as we have learned to do in the past, and to pick and choose how they wish to plan their holidays. Of course, now that several parties are involved, the question arises as to who is responsible in the event that there is a problem with the service and from whom the consumer will ultimately claim compensation. My fellow Members rightly raised this matter and we need to find answers and to update the directive which we have applied to date.
I particularly have in mind the fact that over the next few years, we are going to have two million people passing the age of 60 in the European Union. That gives a great opportunity to the industry to tap in to what those people would like to do in terms of travel, particularly travel without hassle. If this directive is all-inclusive and offers full protection, it is a great opportunity for the industry to tap into the over-60s in this European Union, which would be of great benefit to them. I think, therefore, that, like the Timeshare Directive, this can be seen as a win-win situation both for the consumer and also for the industry.
For me, one of these criteria is the age of the children. Whichever tour operator we are talking about, there are fixed prices for children. Sometimes, this affects six year olds, then ten year olds, next time twelve year olds. With some operators, the first child is not worth as much as the second, and the third and fourth do not exist at all. It is important for the protection of consumers - as well as for the protection of travel agents and operators - that as a consumer, I know what I am buying, so that I feel really well informed beforehand and have comparable criteria.
We have heard about the issue of credit card charging, and there has been discussion on hidden charges. However, airline and travel companies are exploiting the fact that more people use their credit cards to book due to the protection they receive from using them, by placing double credit card charges for each leg of our journey or placing credit card charges on passengers for one online booking. You might have one online booking, but you are charged four times for using your credit card because you have four passengers involved. Commissioner, could you please look at this in order that people are protected.
(LT) Over the last two decades, the travel market has developed in a very dynamic manner. More and more people are making their own travel arrangements by purchasing services from various operators and service providers. However, the provisions of the directive currently in force do not apply to these new travel packages, and this means that our citizens are travelling without proper protection. I think that while revising the directive, it is necessary to define more accurately its scope and we should not allow inflexible rules to leave our citizens without appropriate protection. Moreover, the question of liability must be resolved in cases where air carriers or travel service providers go bankrupt. Over the last decade, more than 70 airlines have gone bankrupt, leaving travellers in the dark. Therefore, I believe that this matter must be highlighted clearly when we review the provisions of the directive.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have listened to the views of the honourable Members with great interest. Many of you have affirmed the direction being taken by the Commission. Others have underlined and emphasised many points that we have noted to make sure that they are all taken into consideration in the deliberations and discussions that we will be having on this revision of the directive. I would like to assure you that the Commission takes these issues very seriously and is determined to find the best solutions for the way forward.
We are now in the middle of a consultation process. We are analysing the feedback we gathered from the recent online public consultation. Consumers, businesses, organisations and Member States have all contributed. Moreover, I can inform you that the Commission will host a stakeholders' workshop on 22 April 2010. This workshop will focus on possible policy options for the revision of the Package Travel Directive, including all the issues that have been mentioned during this debate. I must stress that it is, as yet, too early to decide the way forward. It is essential to respect the impact assessment procedure. However, I am determined that any action should aim at ensuring a high level of protection for the EU's citizens.
So consumers are not unfavourable to this project, but they do have to have security, and it is a worry if there are not sufficient safeguards for the management and checking of the mandate of direct debits. Payment systems take up one third of the operating costs of banks so there is a lot in it for banks to get SEPA right, but they cannot have it all their own way. The European Payments Council must recognise that consumers are worried about frauds and confidence tricks, and who is looking out for them. Some busy people may not notice a new transaction, especially if the amount is a common one. Therefore, there must be possibilities for the consumer to have extra safeguards around the setting up of direct debits. It is no good to say that banks will pick up all the frauds. Banks have not picked up fraudulent cheque practices. For example, in France, there have been problems with back-of-cheque endorsement frauds on cheques made out to a bank being paid into a third-party account. This has happened four years after the UK Financial Services Authority closed that loophole. It is not satisfactory to solve these problems with add-ons or additional offers of services which do not protect everyone. That is the fraudster's charter. It is not satisfactory to be done country by country. That is the cross-border fraudster's charter.
This year should see a significant increase in the use of SEPA by public authorities, so the moment is right to press forward, especially asking Member States that have not made plans to participate in the surveys. We also ask that those - or maybe it is that - Member State that has not solved the problem of continuing legal validity of existing direct debit mandates to get on with it and solve the problem. Perhaps the other main stumbling block is the multilateral interchange fee for card payments and, again, this needs resolving in a way that is also in accord with competition policy.
As I speak to you now - it is early March - it is really too early for me to announce that end date. I have noted your suggestion of 2012, Mrs Bowles, and I will bear it in mind. Whatever the case, we will have to permit operators an adjustment period, for example, 12 months for transfers and at least 24 months for withdrawals. Another advantage of a legislative initiative could be to deal with some of the issues raised by your resolution and by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council in order to improve the quality of SEPA products for users.
My second point, Mrs Bowles, is that we need clarification on multilateral interchange fees. It is an important issue for the financing and therefore the development of SEPA cards and withdrawals. In late 2009, the Commission published a discussion document which included new data as well as the opinions of various types of users on this issue We will touch on the result of that public consultation in a moment. This issue must, of course, be analysed on the basis of its compatibility with competition policy, for which my colleague, Mr Almunia, is responsible.
Nevertheless, I would like to make several comments. There is a short-term, transitory system in place for withdrawals until November 2012, allowing multilateral interchange fees of up to 8.8% for cross-border transactions. I note, however, that more than 70% of withdrawals in Europe are now carried out without the imposition of any multilateral interchange fee on the transaction. The multilateral interchange fee, therefore, does not seem to be the only financing mechanism, or even the most effective one.
Thirdly, as I had the opportunity to mention at my hearing, I am in favour of launching a European initiative on cards. A series of initiatives is being developed in the private sector, for example, the Monnet project, PayFair, and the European Alliance of Payment Schemes. Mrs Bowles, ladies and gentlemen, I will soon be meeting the main players in this market in order to jointly assess their willingness to move forward and perhaps to coordinate their initiatives and determine a framework for action. At the same time, the Commission will be analysing, from the perspective of competition regulations, the arguments presented by the card systems in order to justify their financing system.
I will simply remind you that the difficulty of the subject stems from the fact that the single euro payments area (SEPA) is an initiative of payment institutions, particularly banks. Also, may I say that the purpose of the directive on payment services, for which I had the honour of being rapporteur, was specifically designed to enable us to identify and define the legal instruments needed in order to put this European payments system in place. Another purpose of the directive was to improve competition in the area of payments, and Title II made provision for the creation of payment institutions, which were intended to break the monopoly of the banks.
There has also been the matter of interchange fees, which deserves to be tackled. There are two issues involved. The first, as you mentioned, is that of conformity to the rules of competition, but the second issue, which must not be neglected, is that the payment service is a commercial activity for payment institutions which must, therefore, be fairly remunerated. What has been condemned is the possibility of setting interbank margins unilaterally, arbitrarily and without consultation, when these rightly appear excessive.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Single Euro Payments Area is an important, indeed central, instrument of the European single market. It is thanks to Mr Gauzès that we have got it off the ground. My group is fully behind it and would like to see it working well. I personally also have nothing against us setting a deadline for the migration, and here to me it is not so much a question of whether it takes three, four or five months as the fact that it then actually works.
Secondly, it must, of course, also work for the benefit of the economy. Here I would like to mention one point, which is still a bone of contention, namely the matter of how direct debits will be calculated. Here, the economy does not yet seem to be in a position to propose a sensible model. There are still snags, there are still sticking points and if the economy is not in a position to present a common model that works within the European Union, then the Commission - as stipulated in this proposal for a resolution - must present a concrete proposal within a certain period of time, let us say before the end of the year. It should not be the case that we confront the economy and demand a deadline for the migration, but do not take the initiative to remove the resistance that the payment service providers are obviously not in the position to overcome single-handedly. We need a community initiative here, so the whole thing can work. That is our approach to the discussion.
The other side of the euro coin is, however, the lack of consistency and the lack of accountability, and here there are, of course, some questions for the Commission. Firstly, who is responsible for the lack of control in the euro system? Secondly, who is responsible for the fact that the false budget figures from Greece were not recognised sooner? Thirdly, is it not the case that while we are talking about Greece today, the real problem is Spain? Fourthly, can the European Commission guarantee that Spain will not submit false budget figures and what is it doing about this?
The procedure that is currently planned in the rulebook is a very bureaucratic, very complicated procedure and therefore, I would be very pleased, Commissioner, if, with regard to a final date - something we all want - this area in particular is tackled once again. On the one hand, there should be no vulnerability to fraud - that is a problem in the cross-border area - but on the other hand, it should also be possible for local charges to be debited, and for any magazine subscription, any insurance premium, any mobile phone bill, and so on to continue to be collected in a simple procedure by the companies concerned.
Secondly, I would like to say that the method of self-regulation in the banking area that we have chosen for SEPA is a method in which the organs work well and several hundred banks have joined the SEPA area in a very short space of time. SEPA is part of the single market, it is larger than the euro area, but it is not complete. I am very much in favour of a consistent, legally binding final date, because I hope that with such a date, we will increase the pressure to take care of outstanding questions and the legal obligation to get consistent implementation off the ground. This will allow all participants once again to present everything that still has to be done. A common date is essential to implement the SEPA area as quickly and efficiently as possible and to ensure maximum suitability for the single market.
Another major benefit will result from the reduction of the overall costs to the European economy of moving capital around the region, which is estimated today at two to three per cent of the total gross domestic product. We must remember that the end goal of SEPA was to create a truly domestic payments environment all around Europe, and it is understandable that achieving such an ambitious goal is by no means easy, especially when considering the unfortunate necessity of finding compromises between the often conflicting interests of the pan-European banking community.
(RO) I would like to inform you that my country, Romania, is taking some important steps with regard to the implementation of and migration to SEPA. In October 2009, Directive 64/2007/EC on payment services in the internal market was transposed into Romanian legislation. Back in 2007, the Romanian Banking Association, a member of the European Payments Council, took on the role of support organisation for joining the SEPA schemes. In fact, the migration to SEPA Credit Transfer will be completed by the date when the euro is adopted, while, so far, only five banks are planning to join the SEPA Direct Debit scheme in the next three years.
Mr President, I would like to thank all those who spoke for their contribution. What particularly struck me during the course of Mrs Bowles's initial speech was the fact that the whole Parliament has shown unanimous support for the implementation of the single euro payments area (SEPA), as it had already amply demonstrated in the past. That is confirmed by the draft resolution. It is a project that is two years old and I think that it needs to be implemented now. Once again, I repeat that I have been struck by the unanimity that was expressed again a moment ago on the need to set a deadline.
SEPA will only be a success if it fully meets the expectations of consumers and the people who use it. I am talking about businesses, particularly small businesses, consumers, and national administrations. The Commission hopes - and it will move in that direction - that the concerns of users are taken into account when implementing SEPA. I would like to say to Mrs Băsescu that I will also pay attention to the efforts of the new Member States - and I know that such efforts exist in your country as well as in others - to be fully included in the SEPA project, which is in everyone's interests.
Finally, with regard to cards, which I mentioned in my hearing, it seems that greater clarity is needed. Once again, I need a few weeks, or a few months at most, in which to hold meetings in order to clarify the key players' intentions and determine the extent to which they are prepared to coordinate or combine their efforts regarding the financing model for a potential pan-European card system. As for the competitive framework in which it should operate, that is a issue that I will have to raise with the banking sectors' key players.
We therefore welcome the firm stance taken by the European Commission on anti-competitive behaviour. It is essential that sanctions punish bad behaviour, in particular, of repeat offenders, but they must encourage compliance at the same time. Sanctions must have a sufficiently deterrent effect. High fines are an effective tool but, as a single instrument, they may be too blunt. Therefore, we invite the Commission to come up with proposals to make the toolkit more sophisticated and more effective. In the report, we suggest looking at issues such as individual responsibility, transparency and accountability of firms, shorter procedures, due process and the development of European standards and corporate compliance programmes.
A second key issue is State aid. In the context of the economic crisis, huge amounts of State aid have been granted. Exceptional circumstances call for exceptional measures. We recognise that, but we should not lose sight of the fact that granting State aid comes at a price. It distorts competition and it leads to record levels of public debt and budget deficits. The bill for this episode will be presented to future generations. We have a duty to justify every single cent that has been spent. I am therefore pleased that ECON urges the Commission to do a thorough evaluation of the results of the exceptional State aid operation.
I would like now to say a few words on the issue of vertical restraints. We know the current agreement will be revised for May of this year. The European Commission previously committed to closely involving the European Parliament in the review process. However, to my disappointment, I had to read about the latest version of the proposals in the media. When I then asked the Commission to get the same documents as had been leaked to the press, it took considerable arm twisting to get them and I cannot hide my annoyance at this. The Commission should put an end to the systematic and deliberate leaking to the press. To deny that it happens, frankly, is an insult to our intelligence.
Finally, Commissioner, we very much welcome Commissioner Almunia's pledge to closely involve Parliament in shaping competition policies. The economic crisis has clearly shown the need for greater democratic legitimacy of competition policies and, in this context, I assume that the incident with the document on vertical restraints was just a mistake. We recognise the independence of the Commission - and, as a liberal, I certainly do so - but we also expect the Commission to closely involve Parliament in shaping competition policies along the lines set out in the report.
This dialogue is, in fact, essential to the good functioning of all policies, and in our opinion, that includes competition policy. Parliament has reminded us of its wish to see competition policy operating within the framework of the codecision procedure. Mrs in 't Veld, please allow me to speak frankly: the Commission does not have the authority to modify the provisions of the treaty regarding the legal basis applicable to this competition policy. However, we are prepared to examine, on a case-by-case basis, whether codecision can be applied to the new initiatives when their objectives go beyond the sphere of competence of competition.
On this point, you know that Commissioner Almunia announced in January that Parliament would be fully involved in all legislative initiatives relating to damages actions brought by private individuals. The Commission, like Parliament, does not believe that the current economic crisis can justify relaxing competition rules on the control of concentrations or on State aid. The Commission's current record clearly shows that it has remained very steadfast on these principles: preventing all distortions of competition, even during periods of crisis, whilst being flexible and open on procedures when necessary.
(DE) Mr President, to begin with, I would like to thank you and the Commissioner for your presentation and I would firstly like to point out that control of the content of the provisions of European competition law is very much in the interest of consumers. I am delighted that this time, the Commission has, for the first time, included its own chapter on competition law and its significance for consumers. That is particularly gratifying after a five-year barren spell in the communication of European competition policy on the part of the European Commission.
(LT) As shadow rapporteur, I would firstly like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mrs in 't Veld, for preparing an excellent report. I think that the report underlines clearly those areas to which the Commission should draw particular attention. First of all, there is the monitoring of State aid measures. During the crisis, the European Commission has given Member States the opportunity to apply State aid measures exclusively. As such measures were provided in a hurry, the Commission must examine whether these measures were used purposefully, whether they were productive, and whether the crisis caused a protectionist reaction by Member States, as protectionism and the division of the common market are damaging to competition and only weaken the European Union's position in the global economy. I am also pleased that the rapporteur took into account the opinion of the ITRE Committee on the problems of the European Union's internal energy market, in particular, the fact that it is impossible to ensure this market's competitiveness and general operation as long as there are energy islands and energy infrastructures are not interconnected and working properly.
I am pleased to be able to present the 19th Internal Market Scoreboard, which was produced in July last year. This document shows that Member States are managing increasingly well with the transposition of EU law. Once again, the objective has been achieved - the objective which the Heads of State or Government set themselves so that the average transposition deficit would not exceed 1%. Nevertheless, the number of directives which have not yet been transposed in one or more Member States, in other words, market fragmentation, is still too high. It is over 100 internal market directives. In addition, as many as 22 directives have not been transposed two years after expiry of the deadline for this. The Member States must do even more for the internal market to become something which benefits all Europeans.
At this moment, as I present this report to you, I have in my hand the next scoreboard, the round-number 20th edition, which shows further progress in transposition of EU legislation. The transposition deficit has fallen to 0.7%, so significantly lower than the target set. This is the best result ever. It can be very clearly seen that the work of the European Commission which has resulted in this publication is having a mobilising effect on the Member States. We can warmly congratulate the Commission on this productive, hard work.
To this end, the report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection proposes closer cooperation between all the institutions which are jointly responsible for transposition and stakeholders. We propose holding an annual Single Market Forum, or SIMFO, which would bring together the European institutions, but which would also bring together Member States, members of national parliaments and representatives of business and consumers. A forum of this kind will be an opportunity for the exchange of experience and best practices concerning transposition of EU law, as well as for the preparation of strategies for meeting the challenges which are still ahead of us.
Despite the concern regarding responsibility for consumer issues being shared by two Commissioners, we hope that this work will continue to make progress and bear fruit and that the focus on consumers will not be weakened as a result of the new Commission. This responsibility is, in fact, now even greater, since Article 12 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that consideration is to be given to consumer protection requirements in the drawing up and implementation of the Union's other policies and activities. This is an important step for consumers and something that I do not intend to allow anyone to forget in my continued political work.
Effective application and surveillance of the EU's provisions on consumer protection are essential if we are to increase consumer confidence. However, surveillance in the EU is far from uniform and, according to the statistics, there are significant differences between Member States in terms of market surveillance budgets and the number of working inspectors. Both the Commission and the national surveillance authorities must therefore increase their efforts if we are to achieve the aim of bringing about good consumer protection and ensuring that consumers feel sufficiently confident to be able to exploit all the opportunities offered by the internal market.
This additional staff must be supplied in a logical and controlled manner, taking into account the size of the country's population and the previous number of cases the centre has dealt with in the past. This analysis must be carried out with a view to providing additional staff only in those places where there is a genuine need. Providing SOLVIT with additional staff obviously incurs some costs as well. The report invites Member States to use all the resources available to fund additional staff, including alternative methods of financing.
Another focus area in this report is the promotion of the SOLVIT network, which I personally consider to be of paramount importance, and I believe that all of you will concur with me on this. By calling upon the services of SOLVIT, SMEs can save large sums of money which they can invest in other areas capable of generating economic growth and which are more beneficial to their development than the legal assistance which they would need to resolve any problems. As far as individual consumers are concerned, SOLVIT offers them the benefit of avoiding lengthy and costly judicial proceedings.
However, to enjoy the benefits offered by the SOLVIT network, citizens and companies firstly need to be aware of the network's effectiveness. This is why I believe that we should actively involve national authorities, the European Commission, as well as members of this Parliament, in promoting SOLVIT. There are numerous ways of doing this, ranging from the mass media and information campaigns organised by Member States to the creation of a single SOLVIT portal. In addition, the public services which are involved in the implementation of European legislation governing the internal market could appoint someone in charge of SOLVIT's communications, which would again boost the network's efficiency and contribute to its promotion. As MEPs, we can take the initiative ourselves to promote SOLVIT and we can help raise awareness about it among our colleagues at national parliament level.
Finally, we cannot ignore the fact that SOLVIT often faces many cases which do not come under its remit or which are especially complex, requiring solutions using alternative methods. Petitions submitted to the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions may offer a solution for those cases which are too complex to be resolved at SOLVIT level. This is why one of the proposals suggested by this report is for the SOLVIT portal to forward such cases to the website of the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions, as well as to the specialist committees in the national parliaments.
In my political life, ladies and gentlemen, I have often considered that the monitoring effect is at least as important as the announcement effect. I therefore think it very important, when one is in a national parliament, or the European Parliament, when one is in the Commission, that one should have instruments to check and to evaluate the concrete, genuine implementation of the texts one is voting for. I also think that in order to act properly, one needs to understand properly, and it is precisely on this point that your rapporteurs have focused with a great deal of skill and vigilance.
Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein has just spoken about the good news and the not so good news concerning this scoreboard. We are talking here about 1 521 directives or texts that enable the internal market to function, and that is a lot. There is currently a transposition deficit which, precisely as you said, is at its lowest ever level. This is good news, and we must thank all those who, in the Member States, and sometimes in the regions, are responsible for implementing this directive. I would also like to include in these thanks my colleagues in the Directorate-General for the Internal Market.
There is also one piece of news that is not so good, and that is that the quality of transposition, the quality of implementation, is unsatisfactory. We must therefore all work together, with the European Parliament, with the national parliaments, with the officials in each Member State. This is the purpose, as I told you when I was heard by Parliament, of the visits I am going to make as of now - I have already begun - to each of the 27 capitals to meet in person, under the authority of the competent ministers, the officials responsible for implementing the internal market directives, and for working out the items on this scoreboard and getting SOLVIT up and running, as Mr Buşoi has clearly said.
This is also why I told Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein that I agree with this idea of a forum; it is a very good idea. We need to bring people together, and we shall do so together, here in Parliament, with the Commission, the national parliaments and all those responsible in each Member State for sharing, evaluating and exchanging good practices. I fundamentally believe in the benefit of pooling those in charge: agreement rather than constraint, agreement first, mutual trust and shared labour.
As far as SOLVIT is concerned, Mr Buşoi has pointed out the importance of this tool, which is beginning to work well. We currently have 1 500 cases that have been dealt with by cooperation, by resolution, by mediation, essentially on behalf of citizens, but also on behalf of a large number of businesses. As Mr Buşoi quite rightly pointed out, this enables savings in terms of money and time and in this way, citizens, consumers and businesses are returned to their place at the heart of the single market rather than having to enter into excessively cumbersome procedures so that a solution to their problems can be found, included and provided in the implementation of this or that internal marketrelated provision that concerns them.
Consumer policy lies at the heart of the economic and social challenges that we face today. It is all about people. Informed and empowered consumers drive innovation and competitiveness but, perhaps most importantly, making the internal market work for consumers is our trump card in reconnecting with citizens. The central role given to consumer policy is reflected in a number of portfolios. Indeed, the College will be working together closely on ensuring that the rules adopted translate into practical benefit for consumers. I am here today with my friend Michel Barnier, just as an indication that this is the close way in which we will be working together. This will be our working practice.
The consumer dimension is to be developed in all portfolios and benchmarks will be adopted across the Commission to measure progress or the lack of it. The Consumer Scoreboard serves as an alarm system, telling us even when the internal market is letting consumers down. The scoreboard also serves to monitor progress in integrating the retail side of the internal market for consumers, SMEs and other retailers. It also helps to show whether Member States are doing enough to enforce new consumer law and to inform, educate and empower consumers.
Turning to enforcement, I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the Commission's view about the importance of giving people in practice the rights they have on paper. We have a long way to go in this regard. The communication of July 2009 aimed at identifying ways of making enforcement more effective, efficient and consistent throughout the European Union. It now needs to be translated into concrete action. One priority will be to step up efforts to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our cross-border networks, which must send strong messages to traders that there is no safe haven in the EU where they can hide from pursuit. The same applies to cooperation with authorities in third countries. To achieve this, national enforcers need sufficient staff and resources. In tough economic times, all public services are under pressure, but cutting back on enforcement of consumer rights can only be false economy. Free, open, well-policed markets encourage competition on quality and price and drive competitiveness. This benefits not only consumers but also the EU economy as a whole. Both the Commission and Parliament should work together to ensure that this message rings out loud and clear across Member States.
We also intend to continue the good work in establishing Europe-wide coordinated enforcement - so-called sweeps. However, these sweeps have shown that sometimes, combining national efforts is not enough. European solutions are needed. I will therefore happily take up your invitation to explore the legal basis in the treaty with a view to strengthening consumer protection, in particular, enhancing the Commission's capabilities, but this will be done and we will go down this road if we are first convinced that it will add value to work at national level.
On behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I have drawn up an opinion on the SOLVIT network, which I fully support, since it is a means which helps citizens who encounter difficulties. However, I would like to make an important point on which I will elaborate: the need for full cooperation between all the stakeholders who are contacted by the citizen. What options are available to the citizen who encounters a difficulty? He may either file a petition in front of the European Parliament, which is endowed with such power under Article 194 of the treaty, he may present a complaint to the European Commission, or else he may file a complaint with SOLVIT. The citizen may also seek redress by addressing a complaint to the European Ombudsman, but this creates great confusion with the result that the citizen would not know exactly where to seek redress and assistance. Consequently, in my opinion, and on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I appeal for greater cooperation between all institutions involved so that the citizen will know exactly where he needs to seek redress.
The problem revealed by our three reports has two levels: first and foremost is the tardiness of a number of Member States in implementing European law into national practice, with a shortfall of 100 directives that have not fully entered into force in connection with the internal market. I know this is a small percentage, but it is an important percentage. Secondly is the very poor use made of SOLVIT as a practical instrument. For example, in the Czech Republic, it is well known among professionals, but only 7% of registered entrepreneurs know anything about the service. The situation in France is far worse. According to the statistics, SOLVIT is looked after by just one individual on work experience.
I am delighted that our committee has also supported the proposals I presented as a shadow rapporteur; for example, the measure to increase the professional administrative staff of the SOLVIT network in Member States. However, it is mainly a matter of promoting the network among entrepreneurs, expatriates, various associations, national parliaments and also this Parliament. I would like to mention the need to link SOLVIT with the unified points of contact and advisory services operated by the Commission and, of course, it is important for the Commission to inform all countries in a timely manner of the issues resolved through the SOLVIT network. The Commission should present these analyses in annual reports and, in this way, we could of course improve the usability of the SOLVIT network.
The second political principle is that we must guarantee a high level of protection of the rights of both consumers and workers. In other words, the internal market does not mean the abolition of rights and it does not mean deregulation. It means ensuring that we preserve our very high level of common rights in these areas. For this reason, there is one paragraph in Mrs von Thun Und Hohenstein's report that we do not agree with. This concerns the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard or internal market test. This is the wrong approach. It gives the impression that the only important thing is how the market is functioning. That is not the case. We need to ask what impact the European Union legislation will have on the rights of workers and on the rights of consumers. We therefore reject this concept, because it is the wrong one.
In the context of economic crisis, Mr Barnier, the internal market is an asset that we really must develop. Within this internal market, of course, it is consumption which is perhaps the most important driver that we need to support in the very short term. Not any kind of consumption, however. We need the sort of consumption that prepares for the future, that is in line with the challenges of sustainable development, responsible consumption that is not always seeking to promote discount products that are supposed to enhance the purchasing power of families but which, in fact, are often mediocre in quality and which derive from the almost systematic relocation of their production outside the Union. We know who their main victims are: the consumers with the lowest income, the most vulnerable consumers.
In short, we must re-establish trust between consumers and businesses, especially distribution businesses, to strengthen and promote the development of our EU's internal market. I would like to address a very clear message to the Commission. Yes, Mr Dalli, you will have our support, but we experience that unease born of the risk associated with the distribution of competences between yourselves. We fear that this will lead to the fragmentation of your responsibilities. At the same time, we shall be very much on the alert to see that you are really working together in a coordinated manner. We expect consumers' interests to be genuinely taken into account in all the European Union's policies, in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon.
I shall give you an example immediately that links not only Mr Barnier and Mr Dalli, but also Mrs Reding. It is time to follow up the Green Paper on collective redress. We expect you to make progress on this matter. Since you have referred to it, by the way, Mr Dalli, I would like to ask you whether you already have a schedule on this matter. We also expect you to come up with a specific new European form so that this collective redress will avoid the all too familiar abuses of the US system, so that we come up with something that can benefit everyone, that does not pit the interests of one side against the other.
Mr President, I would like to follow on from what Mr Barnier said at the start about the considerable importance of the internal market in the current crisis. This has been proven very clearly once again. However, the internal market obviously requires citizens to have confidence in it. Only then will it function in the right way. This is still lacking at many levels. In the debates in our own countries, we parliamentarians in particular very often notice that these fears of the internal market are still very much in evidence amongst the general public and that subjects like protectionism are, unfortunately, also well received because these sorts of things are not only propounded by governments, but are also supported by many citizens. It is therefore all the more important for us in Parliament to do our utmost to boost confidence in the internal market. Consumer policy is, of course, a key element in achieving this. Consumer policy providing a high level of consumer protection can increase and safeguard people's confidence in the internal market. We therefore need to work harder in this area.
I welcome the fact that both of the Commissioners are here today. You are, of course, aware that our group, too, was critical of the fact that there is no longer a single commissioner responsible for consumer policy, because the message sent out by Mrs Kuneva was a very positive one. We therefore welcome the fact that you are giving us a very clear signal here that you want to cooperate in this area. We were also concerned that, by dividing the responsibilities between different commissioners, consumer protection would ultimately receive insufficient attention. I hope, however, that this is not just a one-off occurrence, but that you will cooperate on this very closely with us, because we have some very important issues to address; for example, we still have to finish debating the subjects of class actions law and collective redress, and progress needs to be made in this regard. Of course, that will also play a very important part in increasing the confidence of citizens.
We need more instruments that make it clear that citizens are protected in the internal market. SOLVIT is a very important instrument in this regard. We therefore wholeheartedly support Mr Buşoi's report. SOLVIT, which provides an opportunity for out-of-court solutions, creates confidence in the internal market and provides consumers with a better knowledge of the internal market and this is something that is very often lacking on the part of the authorities in the Member States. SOLVIT can provide an important and key addition in this respect. This year, I am rapporteur for the budget and I can assure Mr Dalli that we will be vigilant in budgetary matters and the allocation of resources in the area of consumer policy. We have already approached our Committee on Budgets and emphasised that we, of course, want funds to continue to be provided and that we want the appropriate money to be used. In this regard, you can count on our support.
To summarise once again, I think that, overall, these reports send out a very important and very positive signal. Although we support them, we do have one point of criticism. This relates to the internal market check, which we feel is rather one-sided. If we are going to review the directives, they need to be reviewed from various different viewpoints. Sustainability is very important here, as are social issues. A review, if it is to be carried out, must not focus solely on the single aspect of the internal market. It must be a comprehensive review. The subject of subsidiarity must also be given adequate consideration in this regard. We therefore find the one-sided focus on the internal market check regrettable. In principle, however, we support the approach of the rapporteur, including with regard to the internal market check, and we will vote in favour of the report.
Mr President, the process of building the common market based on the four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, capital and services - is still an unfinished process, especially if we are thinking of the fourth freedom, the free movement of services, and we still have a very great deal to do. It is an extremely significant process, particularly at a time of sluggishness in the economy and in view of the economic crisis we are facing in Europe. Indeed, it is at a time of economic slowdown that we ought to talk about the merits of the common market, and perhaps then we will see the political will for which Mr Rochefort has appealed.
I would like, for this reason, to congratulate the Bureau of the European Parliament for realising the importance of the matter and deciding to make the debate on these three reports a priority debate for this sitting of Parliament. My thanks and congratulations are also due to Mr Harbour, Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for the effectiveness of his efforts in this regard. I would also like to congratulate the three rapporteurs for these three reports of such importance. I cannot but notice, however, a certain absurdity. In plenary today, we are discussing Mrs Thun's report - an excellent report, I would like to add - but it is a report about the Internal Market Scoreboard for 2008. However, several days ago, the Commission published the Internal Market Scoreboard for 2009. I think this is another reason why, in future, the Commission should publish all four important reports monitoring the internal market at the same time. After all, the Internal Market Scoreboard, the Consumer Markets Scoreboard, the SOLVIT Report and the Citizens Signpost Service are all, in fact, about the same thing, and we should receive them at the same time.
We do not agree with the position and the view that more efficient and flexible consumer markets are fundamental factors for competitiveness and citizens' prosperity. The economic crisis proves that we need to be guided by the particular conditions in each state and not by the dogmatic application of a single standard, namely that of unadulterated competition. We consider that competitiveness is not intertwined with citizens' prosperity, because it tends to favour companies, given that, to date, price reductions as a whole have demonstrably not benefited consumers.
This being so, we agree with a scoreboard to record and evaluate European consumer satisfaction with the smooth operation of the market but, on the other hand, we should not move away from the essence and the objective, which is none other than to operate a people-oriented internal market which revolves around man's prosperity, not around numbers. We see a consumer scoreboard as a tool for recording the extent of consumer satisfaction within a specific framework and at a particular point in time. However, this evaluation and these records alone cannot bring greater prosperity to citizens purely and simply because, apparently, they will give consumers greater self-confidence and security.
There were many points on which we were in total agreement, and others I hope we can work on in the future: specifically, the European consumer scoreboard promoted by the European Commission, a very important instrument that nonetheless, in my view, still does not provide standardised data to enable people to make clear decisions. If we were a company and we decided on the future of the company based on data that was still inaccurate, we could go bankrupt. That is why, in future, I hope that we can work on a database that enables people to make clear decisions.
The first is the need to adopt a more qualitative approach in respect of the implementation of the Internal Market Scoreboard, enabling the causes of the transposition deficit to be identified. We do not underestimate the usefulness of the statistical data and the pressure that comes from promoting the EU's good and bad students, but in our opinion, the Commission ought to be more ambitious and try to make this scoreboard a tool designed to appreciate the difficulties encountered by the Member States within the context of the transposition process. All the more so since we all know that the transposition deficit may sometimes be due not to ill will by the Member States, but to the mediocre quality of the European legislation to be transposed.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Dalli, the fact that we are discussing three own-initiative reports on consumer protection and the internal market today shows that, despite all of our successes in these areas, there is still much that is in need of improvement. Admittedly, the Member States' transposition of the internal market directives has, on average, greatly improved, but seven Member States have failed to meet the target set by the Commission of reducing the transposition deficit for the internal market directives to 1%.
The main problem, however, has more to do with the application of EU law than with its transposition. Thus, in the event of treaty infringements by Member States, it takes, on average, 18 months - in other words, still far too long - for them to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice. This can be seen from the current internal market scorecard, and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds that unacceptable. This deficit will lead to problems for citizens and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which depend on harmonised rules within the internal market, but which meet with unexpected, time-consuming and bureaucratic obstacles when they want to operate across borders.
This is why it is important for SOLVIT to be developed further. SOLVIT is an online problem-solving network in which the Member States work together in a pragmatic way to resolve problems that have arisen as a result of the misapplication of internal market rules by public authorities. All Member States must ultimately provide the financial resources and adequately trained staff for the SOLVIT centres. The ALDE Group calls emphatically for people to be made more aware of SOLVIT in the Member States in order to facilitate the cross-border sale of their products and services. For this purpose, the involvement of the relevant associations in large-scale information campaigns is just as necessary as a uniform, easy-to-understand and easy-to-find Internet portal for receiving all kinds of complaints.
Secondly, the report by Mrs Hedh, which, like all reports that we debate here, has been added to superbly by the shadow rapporteurs, shows that we need to attach just as much importance to consumer confidence as to the confidence of entrepreneurs. That will be a task for the future, for which a solution can only be found by putting the long-term focus on the goal of the internal market, putting an end to the fragmentation into individual directorates general and different political approaches, and actually seeing the internal market as the grand aim of the European project that we have rather neglected in recent years.
SOLVIT is a great concept and I think Commissioner Dalli summed it up by saying it is all about people. It is citizen-centred, and it tries to help those who come up against barriers and problems created by the EU and to solve the problem in 10 weeks. I know that some people would shirk from the idea that 'I am from the government and I am here to help', but SOLVIT is, in essence, a network across 27 Member States which is there to do exactly that: help.
I would like to put on record and pay tribute to all those who work in Member State SOLVIT centres. Just last year, I met with the small-staffed team who run the SOLVIT centre in the United Kingdom. The way the SOLVIT centre works in the UK is a model of best practice because it tries and uses a SOLVIT+ model, going further in helping businesses and individuals who contact them with a problem. The team are integrated into the European Regulatory Division within the Department for Business and Industry. One of my many amendments sought to make sure that centres are suitably staffed across the EU with no exceptions.
Commissioner Barnier, in December, I raised the issue of SOLVIT in the Chamber when you were present and mentioned that in the autumn in committee, we were told that in your own Member State, the person running the SOLVIT centre was an intern. Members of the committee were horrified. Can I ask, as I did in December, whether that situation has changed? If you are not able to provide the House with that information, can I ask you to clarify it? It is important that SOLVIT centres are well staffed.
(DA) Mr President, I am shadow rapporteur for the report on the scoreboard for the internal market and I will therefore concentrate on that, and in that respect, this is a day of rejoicing. It is a day on which we can all agree that these scoreboards are working extremely well. They are a great success at a fundamental level, and therefore I presume we can only agree that more should be done to promote them. I am also pleased to note that it looks like the Social Democrats have found out that it is not a good idea to vote against it in any event. With regard to the famous test that has been proposed, we in the group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe naturally support this proposal; moreover, we find it a little difficult to comprehend what the slightly defensive argument against this proposal is really about. We can come back to that, however. I will merely note as a general observation that it is excellent that there is broad agreement on the proposals and the report otherwise.
Another good thing is the focus on enforcement. The SOLVIT centres have received a lot of praise, and I fully support this. As the last speaker mentioned, we could in fact instigate a SOLVIT Day here in Parliament. I feel that SOLVIT's greatest problem at present is that it is not sufficiently known. There really is a great need to bring SOLVIT into focus much more than is happening at present - which brings me to my last point, which concerns emphasising that this is a communication issue, as is also made clear in the report. We really must ensure that we bang the drum in respect of the press and the rest of the public and ensure that much more focus is put on areas such as SOLVIT and the scoreboards.
I have personally met the staff who are responsible for SOLVIT in the Czech Republic. It must be said that this is certainly a very good opportunity for the internal market, but it is also necessary to mention the differences of approach in various countries. It is clearly important here to have a cross-border element and I hope that both Commissioners will contribute towards opening up the cross-border consumer market and especially towards breaking down barriers in the form of various national exemptions, and that we will thereby achieve full harmonisation of the consumer market.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, let us take up the statement made by Commissioner Barnier in his hearing and make the internal market our friend. If we are to take this task seriously, we need to make the internal market a domestic one. If we make the internal market into a domestic market, we will make it into a place where the citizens of the European Union can live. We are Europe. Making it into a place to live, but not into a homeland, is a different matter entirely.
The internal market is not yet complete. It still has a lot of potential for development. The Commission must highlight all obstacles and propose measures for their removal. The euro and the internal market represent our most successful response to the challenges, both internal and external, of globalisation. The strengths of the internal market are the qualifications of European citizens and the small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up 90% of the economy. We therefore need to transpose the Small Business Act in all Member States as quickly as possible. Let us make this Act a hallmark of the internal market. However, 80% of the economy in the European Union is credit-financed and only 20% is financed by the capital market. This is something we need to bear in mind in the re-regulation of the financial market.
I must admit - and I am very glad that Mr Barnier is here - that I understand that my country's government does not really promote it. The increased number of cases would consequently be very tricky to manage for the sole trainee who, currently in 2010, is in charge of the SOLVIT network in France, a country which, it is true, has only 60 million inhabitants and which is only the second Member State in the EU from the point of view of the number of cases submitted in 2009.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to thank the rapporteurs concerned for their constructive work. Despite its shortcomings, the EU's internal market is a great success and I find it difficult to comprehend Mr Colman's criticism. The aim of the internal market is to give consumers a wide range of high quality goods and services at good prices, while at the same time guaranteeing a good level of consumer protection. I therefore think we should work towards full harmonisation of consumer rights with a high level of protection, so that consumers can genuinely exploit the advantages of the internal market. This is of particular importance with the increases in cross-border trade and e-commerce.
As shadow rapporteur for the report for the European Conservatives and Reformists, I stressed, while the report was still at the committee stage, the significance of promoting SOLVIT among EU residents, especially the possibility for citizens and, in particular, businesses, to assert their rights. We probably all agree that it is essential to run an information campaign promoting the SOLVIT network as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. This is so that information about the existence of SOLVIT will reach interested parties. The Internet is crucial here, so it would be good if the Commission listened to the suggestions of Parliament and initiated the creation of a common Internet address with the domain name solvit.eu for all national SOLVIT centres, and Member States which, up till now, have not done so, set up Internet pages with national domains linked to the European SOLVIT portal.
(PL) I warmly congratulate all the rapporteurs, because the reports for which they are responsible have two very important features. Firstly, they do, in fact, very consistently defend the internal market, pointing to shortcomings in its visibility, but, at the same time, very consistently defending it. The second great quality of these reports is that they are generally accepted. I mean that we are dealing with a situation in which the entire European Parliament, including those fellow Members who are very sceptical of the free market, in general defend the internal market and its values - this is a great quality of these reports.
I would like to draw attention to several specific matters. As for SOLVIT, we are dealing with the paradoxical situation, as Mr Kurski has said, in which the instrument which is supposed to even out those differences itself functions in different countries with different levels of efficiency. In my opinion, this requires some kind of coordination, because it must be a consistent system which not only functions well, but functions everywhere in the same way. Something which is very important in Mrs Thun's report is the means which the Commission should find so that a model can ultimately be developed to ensure that none of the legislation we create will be incompatible with the free internal market. This would appear to be a crucial matter in the report. If we managed to build such a mechanism, we would also not need to worry about the future of the new market.
I would like to focus on two crucial points. The first is that we, that is, the Commission and those of us in this House, are assuming that everything runs relatively harmoniously in the internal market and that we have enlightened consumers and fair suppliers. That is often the case, but not always. There are irresponsible suppliers who only see their short-term profits and therefore, we need stronger market surveillance and supervision. However, there are also uninformed consumers. We need better information. It is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable. We need continuous information.
I think that we need to focus more on the problems in the banking and financial services sector as there are currently large differences in the single market with regard to the fees paid for these services. If you are in Romania, for example, and you wish to use a banking service offered by banks - the same banks which also operate in Romania, France, Italy and Austria - you will pay more fees in Romania and at much higher rates. Such a situation is wrong and I believe that citizens, not only in Romania but in other Member States too, are entitled to hope that European institutions will play a more active role in clarifying these discrepancies. I want to reiterate that I am talking about fees and not about bank interest.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their very good reports. Recently, we have been saying a lot about the need to revive the internal market. The Commissioner also spoke about it during the hearing before the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. This will also be the case with Professor Monti's report, for which we are waiting. In my opinion, not enough of the internal market itself is to be found in the European Union's 2020 strategy. The internal market is something which we need. However, we do not need an internal market in name only, but an internal market which is really operational. It cannot be said that we have this at present. There are too many barriers to the free flow of the four freedoms, and they limit the market's potential, while the protectionist policies of Member States are inconsistent with the principles of the internal market. On the one hand, we need proper implementation of the law by Member States and we need support instruments which function well, such as SOLVIT, but we also need deeper (...).
(DE) Mr President, I would like to talk about proposals relating to consumer protection and would, of course, like to start by mentioning the positive aspects: the means of informing and empowering consumers by providing more information at all levels, from municipal, local and regional spheres right up to EU cross-border dealings, the promotion of the consumer - like we do in Austria through anti-trust law - and, of course, tougher penalties for careless banks that grant ill-considered credit. A standardised credit form is also an extremely positive move.
(DA) Mr President, thank you for a good debate here today. I am pleased that Mr Barnier and Mr Dalli have given such support to the need for the consideration of consumers in the internal market. However, I would like to draw attention to one particular paragraph in Mrs Hedh's report - namely paragraph 40, in which we propose the establishment of a European Consumer Agency. I can well imagine that it is something you would like to work towards. Such an agency could help to compile data, to prepare studies on consumer behaviour and, of course, it could also act as a watchdog in respect of the Commission's work and in respect of Parliament's work on consumer issues. I would therefore like to hear your view on the idea, whether it is something you would like to work towards - as far as I am concerned, we could easily locate such an agency in either Malta or France if that would help the process.
Mr President, Mrs Schaldemose has just highlighted the quality of this debate, particularly on the specific point of the consumer agency which, unless I am mistaken, already exists in Canada, and Mr Dalli will tell us how things stand today. I agree with this assessment of the quality of the debate and the quality of all the constructive, critical speeches and proposals that have been made on the implementation and evaluation, on the monitoring of these 1 500 - I repeat, for all those listening to us - 1 500 directives or texts which regulate this large European market. I might add that I am not sure whether I prefer to talk about the large European market rather than the single market, since it would be clearer for citizens and consumers.
There are many ideas, in this report and in all I have heard, that are worth adopting or examining. Mr Bielan has supported the idea of indicators on the application of the rules included in Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein's report. Mrs Gebhardt has also mentioned the economic and social assessment of the directives and the impact studies. Perhaps at this stage, I might respond to the constructive criticism of Mr Harbour concerning the 2020 strategy. Furthermore, I also heard Mrs Handzlik say that we were not talking enough about the internal market.
Frankly, when you actually read the 2020 strategy that the Commission published last week, the internal market is at the heart of this approach and it is everywhere: intelligent growth with patents and other tools; green growth with proper use of procurement contracts; and inclusive, equitable and fair growth. The internal market is everywhere - it must be everywhere - but, Mr Harbour, the 2020 text is not designed to talk about everything. For example, it does not talk about foreign policy and defence policy, nor does it aim to relieve the Commission of its task, which is to properly enforce, supervise and monitor the correct implementation of all the texts. Please believe that I do not feel relieved of the need to check and take action, sometimes even through infringement proceedings, to ensure the proper application of the internal market. However, I will always, I repeat, prioritise agreement, trust and explanation over constraint.
With regard to SOLVIT, to end with a few brief comments, I support the idea - the good idea - that someone mentioned of creating a SOLVIT.EU website. It will disseminate information or refer the user to national sites. We will work very quickly on this SOLVIT.EU site with my departments in conjunction with another project relating to the Your Europe site. As Mr Kelly and you said, though, the word SOLVIT is at least a clear and simple one, and I agree with this positive assessment.
SOLVIT is working well, but it could work better. There are too many citizens and businesses that are still unaware of their rights and the ways in which they can assert them, and I uphold Mrs Werthmann's remark calling for greater transparency. I believe, too, that a number of you, Mrs Vergnaud, Mr Rossi, Mrs Stihler, Mrs Rapti, have referred to the inadequacy of the resources made available to SOLVIT, not only in France, by the way, even though I clearly heard what you said. This is not a French minister addressing you, even though I am a former French minister, and please believe that I will look very closely at what happens in that country - of which I am still a citizen - so that it functions properly, just as I shall do in all the other countries.
Indeed, we require the appropriate, necessary resources, and I will check that during each of my in-situ visits. Once again, these tools are necessary in order to check properly how the internal market is functioning; this market, I say in turn, is not complete. We must relaunch it and develop it further - several people have mentioned this, Mr Stolojan, Mrs Gebhardt, Mr Karas, Mr Kožušník - from the cross-border perspective or even within each country. We must remove the barriers, and that is why, Mr Harbour, it is important to determine where the missing links are, which is something that is perhaps not emphasised enough, but which is nevertheless laid down in the 2020 strategy. I will endeavour to do this with my 12 or 15 colleagues in the College who are responsible, one way or another, for applying the directives on the internal market.
Finally, with regard to the matter criticised by several members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, namely the internal market test, without dramatising this matter, I would remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that any legislative proposal must respect the treaty. This is what the rapporteur means; in other words, it must undergo a test of compatibility with the principles of the internal market. That is one thing, and I am also going to keep an eye on a number of social, environmental and economic criteria, since I am committed to all laws being evaluated in advance.
The common market is one of the greatest achievements of the European Union, and I would like to express my thanks for the positive reactions to the proposals which I have included in my report. To fellow Members who are socialists and are worried about paragraph 10 - the 'internal market test' - I would like to remind you that, firstly, this is nothing new. This proposal was adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as long ago as 2003 and is part of the internal market strategy. We should not be afraid of it. The test does not threaten any of the European Union's social achievements. After all, a moment ago, we heard here from the Commissioner that the European Commission evaluates new directives from the social, economic and ecological point of view, and so there is no need to panic. What we are all concerned about is that the common market should develop further, and we are also concerned to ensure that protectionism does not creep into the European Commission.
European integration will develop only when the citizens are aware and active, and public institutions are competent, effective and citizen-friendly. In this report, I have proposed a number of solutions so that you - fellow Members - can engage your electorate effectively and well in the process of European integration and, in this case, by actually strengthening the common market, increase their share in the common market, that great success of the European Union. We must continue to develop instruments which will help in development of the common market. The simultaneous publication of the four reports is a very important element, as is better coordination and better transposition of legislation. We should not react negatively to the word 'market'. In the part of the world which I come from, we could not use this market for many decades, and we know what that led to.
Apart from the fact that the number of staff employed in some SOLVIT centres needs to be increased to ensure SOLVIT's effectiveness, staff must also be suitably qualified and receive training on internal market regulations. Another factor which is just as important is for SOLVIT staff to be able to receive legal assistance, both from officials working in public administrations and from the European Commission, given the degree of complexity of the cases which are being reported to SOLVIT. The European Commission is sometimes late in responding to requests for legal assistance from SOLVIT staff, which leads to certain delays in the whole process of resolving cases.
The efficient functioning of the internal market is a precondition for an adequate guarantee of the rights bestowed by a treaty in respect of the free movement of persons, services, goods and capital within the Community. In a time of crisis, it may also assist in creating a stable and prosperous economic environment. However, the internal market cannot fulfil its function without the proper implementation, application and enforcement of legislation. The Member States have an obligation to implement laws on time, if they have committed to do this under an agreement. An implementation deficit of 1% may seem small, but if we include the number of overdue or non-implemented directives, it has a significant effect on the functioning of the internal market. Doubts repeatedly arise in the case of certain Member States. I support the provision of more detailed information on the Commission website concerning directives that have not yet been implemented. This information should contribute to greater awareness among the broader public and constitutional bodies in the Member States. I welcome the challenge to Member States to adopt essential measures, including the allocation of resources to secure the functioning of cross-border networks of electronic information systems for the timely exchange of information, especially for hazardous non-food products (RAPEX) and food and fodder (RASFF), or the network for cooperation in the area of consumer protection (CPC). These systems still do not function properly and cannot be relied on in all Member States. It is also necessary to pay attention to the correct application of directives. This can be achieved through effective cooperation between bodies at national, regional and local levels.
in writing. - Serious consideration has to be taken as regards existing Union-wide redress mechanisms such as SOLVIT. This alternative avenue for redress is underused due to a lack of knowledge of its existence on the part of citizens, consumers and businesses, as well as because of the inadequate resources in place at national level. SOLVIT centres that are currently present in each Member State (as well as in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) are understaffed and underfunded - training for staff and funding to improve the administrative capacity of the centres must be stepped up. I call upon the Commission to complete the Single Market Assistance Services (SMAS) project as a matter of priority. I propose that the Commission consider including in the Consumer Markets Scoreboard a detailed account of the progress, achievements and shortcomings of SOLVIT. Furthermore, in an attempt to raise awareness, Member States must promote SOLVIT as an expedient and accessible alternative dispute resolution mechanism, in the form of a nation-wide information campaign. Finally, there needs to be marked improvement on the part of the Commission and the Member States to raise awareness of the opportunities that the Single Market offers for citizens, consumers and businesses.
A society which freely makes use of the possibilities offered by the single market is the foundation for the success of the process of European integration. We will not build a truly unified European Union if people are not convinced that the whole of Europe is their home. This end can, principally, be served by SOLVIT. It is safe to say that the establishment of the SOLVIT system in 2002 was one of those events in the history of Europe as a united continent which appear inconspicuous, but which, with the passing of time, have brought unexpected results. The idea of the system refers directly to the sources of European integration or, in other words, to the fact that it is primarily to serve the citizens of the Union, and not particular Member States or governments.
Can there be anything better than giving ordinary people a simple instrument enabling them to solve problems which restrict their freedom of activity in the single market? However, the experience of nearly a decade has shown that there are numerous barriers which prevent people from making full use of the system's possibilities. We should, therefore, agree with the proposals of the report drawn up by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Above all, we should concentrate on promoting SOLVIT in the Member States, among the citizens, because they know very little about it. Giving greater financial and staffing resources and additional training, or appointing a SOLVIT liaison officer, will be pointless if people do not know they have such an instrument at their disposal. In my opinion therefore, all the measures we take should start with this, although we should not give up the other ideas.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the smooth operation of the internal market must remain a priority for the European Parliament, with services like SOLVIT being essential to ensuring this is the case. The report highlights this point and focuses attention on the problems this service is facing. Although we are all aware that aspects such as communication and raising the SOLVIT service's media profile are of paramount importance, we can still see that these remain some of the recurring problems which the service has been facing right from its early years. Member States and the European Commission must ensure that European citizens, the business sector and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises which need support to be able to make full use of the facilities offered by the internal market, have access to resources which can provide information and a rapid solution. Furthermore, the SOLVIT centres require additional resources. I am referring here to qualified staff and, by extension, ongoing training courses for them. Member States must realise how important these centres are and how instrumental they are in ensuring the correct implementation of the internal market's regulations. I believe that the benefits which this service can offer both citizens and the business sector are far from being fully utilised.
Consumer protection in the European Union must be designed in such a way that citizens can take advantage, within the internal market, of a wide choice of high-quality products and services, while at the same time having confidence that their rights as consumers are protected and that they can exercise them effectively if the need arises. It goes without saying that, to do this, it is also necessary for consumers to be duly aware of their rights and obligations under the applicable law. The initiatives mentioned in the report for providing clarification and information to EU citizens are therefore important and must be implemented quickly. The increasing complexity of the services sector, in particular, presents a huge problem, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to make an informed choice when purchasing goods or services. The knowledge, as well as the needs, of consumers, which have also been brought up by the consumer barometer, must be taken into account by the EU institutions in their policies and lawmaking. We should aim for greater harmonisation of consumer protection regulations - and by that I mean an adjustment upwards - on account of the increasing cross-border use of services. However, in all our attempts to improve the internal market, we must not forget the numerous imports from third countries. In this regard, we need greater cooperation between the customs authorities and consumer protection authorities in the Member States in order to protect consumers from unsafe imports.
Over the years, the scope of EU consumer protection policy has changed to reflect changes in people's needs and expectations. With nearly 500 million consumers, the EU internal market has a significant role in the achievement of the objectives in the Lisbon action plan (economic growth, employment and increasing competitiveness), as consumer spending brings wealth to the EU. Above all, owing to the rapid development of e-commerce, the cross-border dimension of consumer markets in the EU has grown significantly, making it even more important to have high-level consumer protection. Unfortunately, however, today's EU consumer protection regulations have not been implemented and enforced to the same extent in all Member States. In my opinion, stronger supervision of the market and the mechanisms of enforcement, and their effective and comprehensive implementation, are essential for increasing consumer confidence. On this basis, I support the rapporteur's suggestions that the European Commission should observe closely the adoption and implementation of EU consumer rights in the Member States and help them with this in every way. I think that the European Union should consider the idea of creating a European consumer protection office which could function as a coordinating central office dealing specifically with the resolution of cross-border incidents, in order to support and complement the relevant consumer protection offices in the Member States in implementing and enforcing EU consumer protection regulations. I think that the EU consumer protection regulations will not be of much benefit if they are not properly adopted, implemented and enforced at a national level.
Copenhagen was a much smaller step forward than the European Union had wanted but, nonetheless, it was a step forward. One hundred and nine countries - industrialised and developing nations alike which are collectively responsible for more than 80% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions - have now officially included their emission reduction targets and actions in the Accord. In other words, the opportunity is there for us to build on this determination and help channel it into international action. We need to seize this chance to help maintain momentum towards the robust and legally binding global climate agreement for the post-2012 period which, of course, remains our objective.
The Commission's starting point is that the EU must continue to show leadership. We believe that the most convincing way Europe can do so is by taking tangible and determined action domestically to become the most climate-friendly region in the world. We must do this as part of the EU 2020 strategy put forward last week. And let me say this loud and clear: it is in Europe's own interest. How is that? Well, because it will - if we do it intelligently - enhance our competitiveness, strengthen our energy security and stimulate greener economic growth and innovation, thus creating new jobs. The Commission will therefore now undertake work to outline a pathway up to 2050 for the European Union's transition to becoming a low-carbon economy.
This will involve reducing our emissions by 80% to 95% in 2050, as already agreed, and - as this House is well aware - the EU is committed to reducing its emissions to at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and to scaling up this reduction to 30% if the conditions are right. I fully share the wish expressed by this Parliament that the EU should move beyond the 20% target. We need to bring our reduction more closely into line with what the science tells us is necessary in order to meet the Copenhagen Accord's objective of keeping global warming below two degrees. As you also stated in your resolution, the crisis has made it easier to achieve the targets. If today we want to be as ambitious as we were prepared to be when we adopted the Climate and Energy Package back in 2007 and 2008, we would then have to go beyond the 20%. I am therefore also pleased to announce that the Commission will prepare, before the European Council in June, an analysis of which practical policies would be required to implement a 30% emission reduction by 2020. The Commission will also engage in developing an analysis of milestones on our pathway to 2050, including the necessary scenarios of the ambition level for 2030. This will require a need to set out appropriate strategies for the key emitting sectors, consistent with the EU 2020 strategy. In line with the deadline agreed in the ETS Directive, the Commission will also set out its analysis of the situation regarding energy intensive industries in the event of carbon leakage.
Finally, this communication proposes a road map for the next steps in the UN process, to be agreed in Bonn this spring when the negotiations restart. The technical meetings in Bonn need to begin the process of integrating the political guidance provided by the Copenhagen Accord into the UN negotiating text and addressing the outstanding gaps. Most importantly, I think it is very important to see what can be specific deliverables for Cancún. Bringing the developed country targets and developing country actions submitted under the Accord, as well as the political guidance on MRV, into the formal UN negotiation process will be crucial, but also decisions on issues which were neglected in the Accord, such as the evolution of the international carbon market, reducing emissions from international aviation and maritime through ICAO and EIMO, agriculture and other things. In the formal negotiations, there was actually substantial progress made in Copenhagen on the adaptation framework, technology framework, forestry, that could also be among the specific deliverables for Mexico.
Nobody would be happier than me if Cancún also delivered a legally binding global deal and if the legal question was also solved there - and do not be mistaken, the European Union is ready. However, we need to recognise that remaining differences between parties may delay agreement on this until next year. Therefore, we have to manage expectations carefully. I think all of you know that high expectations for Mexico without specific deliverables implies a very high risk of killing this process in the end. So for all of us to whom it is very important to get an international deal, I also think it is very important to pursue this stepwise approach and to try to do whatever we can to ensure that the world gets a legally binding deal before 2012.
Finally, a few words on environmental integrity. Environmental integrity must be our watchwords in the negotiations and I know this is a concern Parliament shares. Therefore, the shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol have to be addressed. By this I mean the limited number of countries it covers - corresponding to only 30% of today's emissions - and the serious weaknesses it contains such as the accounting rules for forestry emissions and the handling of surplus national emission rights from the period 2008 to 2012, which were also highlighted in your February resolution.
Lastly, Europe needs to undertake outreach in order to promote support for the UN process and rebuild confidence that a global deal is possible. We need both to get a better understanding of where our partners stand on key issues and to explain what the EU requires from a global deal. The Commission will undertake outreach in close contact with the Council and the Council Presidency. I will be holding talks in Washington and Mexico this month and plan to visit, among others, India, the Maldives, China and Japan in April.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first to Mr Seeber, about the IPCC and why did we not criticise that or whatever we were supposed to do in this paper: I must say that, although I think it is crucial for the IPCC to take the criticism seriously and try to correct where there are things that need correction, I have seen nothing to date that changes my profound understanding and feeling that, yes, we need to address climate change. There are things, details, leaked mails and all these kinds of things. I have seen nothing more profound that would change my profound attitude and I think that goes for very many, so that is very much deliberate. I think that the IPCC itself must try to be careful now to restore confidence in whatever comes out of the IPCC.
Mrs Ulvskog, you mentioned that I spoke more about 2050 than 2010. This is a strategy on the way forward for 2012. We already have our policy for right now, 2010, in the European Union, so this is a strategy looking forward. Where I think that one of the new things to pay attention to is that we start to say we must define the pathways between 2020 and 2050, and that is why I will come up with something on what should be achieved by 2030.
I definitely do not want to lower expectations but I would be very careful not to raise expectations so high so that those who do not want the international negotiations to succeed could kill the process after Mexico if we do not achieve anything. That is why we must be practical. I will defend before anyone that up to Copenhagen, it was right to keep expectations high, to keep the pressure there and to bring this to the top of the agenda of Heads of State. It made them responsible; it made emerging economies and the United States set domestic targets; it was important. But only once can you do a thing like this and then not achieve it fully. My fear is we cannot do it twice.
Finally, to Chris Davies, yes you are right. We are depending on others to make progress, and that is also why we must do the average and try to analyse the information we get. What is going on in Beijing? What is going on in Delhi? What is going on in Washington? What is going on in the US Congress? And then try to see that, by taking all of these things into consideration, we can, at the same time, ensure that we still have our objective met, namely a legally binding, truly international deal.
If the EU is actually to maintain its leading role in the matter of climate protection, we should raise our target to at least -30%, one which you have already stated the case for. I wish to add that the changes which the recession has actually brought to the situation mean that -20% is, in reality, not a lot different from the 'business as usual' scenario. If we want to be ambitious, we need to make our targets more stringent and bring them up to at least -30%, and preferably -40%.
Of course, nobody should be naive. Of course, we should take care of our own industry, obviously. We should know what we are doing and we should not be naive. My point is simply that I think that, if we do this in an intelligent and coherent manner, it would be possible to choose tools that could, at the same time, benefit climate change and emissions reductions, energy efficiency, energy security, and innovation and job creation. That is what we will be looking for. I am not saying it is going to be easy. We should not think going to 30% will be a piece of cake, although we must know what the potential would be, what the implications would be and that would be the analysis that I would provide before the European Council meeting this June. Then, later this year, we would have the analysis on the pathways to 2050, including this 2030 perspective that I think we have to start thinking about, the reason of course being that we have pledged to reduce by 80% to 95% by 2050. If we do not get started, it is going to be extremely tough in the last one or two decades as we approach 2050.
Can a hypothesis that depends on manipulation of data be a proper basis for justifying enormous expenditure and the closing-down of factories such as the Corus plant in Middlesbrough? The European Union pays enormous subsidies to environmental pressure groups that agree to advise the EU to follow a policy to which it is already committed. Is it appropriate for the European Union to use public funds to subsidise pressure groups? This wastes public money, gives bogus support for European Union policies and compromises the independence of campaigning organisations.
(DE) I wish you a very warm welcome to this House. The loss of confidence in Copenhagen was, in my opinion, one of the major problems. This could theoretically continue worldwide, but also within the European Union. My question to you is as follows. What is happening with the instruments that we adopted last year? The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is of concern to me, because I am not entirely sure what the Commission is currently doing in light of the decision in Copenhagen, for example, with regard to benchmarks, but also to carbon leakage.
When I hear this 'is it not time to pause?', I must just say that the international climate negotiations in many ways have been put on hold for quite a long time. We still need, I believe, substantial progress there. I simply do not understand why, because of a few leaked things, one wants to aim the scepticism at a whole project. That is not my approach. I am the politician. I cannot judge the work of the scientists but I can use my common sense and I can read their main conclusions and see what the facts on the table are like. Then I can myself weigh up whether I want to run the risk of doing nothing, with the very big implications that might have - or, instead, will I try to respond to the challenge?
I am rather concerned that the climate negotiations could suffer the same fate as the Doha negotiations, which are constantly being postponed year after year. My question is, therefore, what is your plan B in order, perhaps, to achieve results in parts of some sectors? I also have a question concerning the Kyoto Protocol. One strategic error we made in Bangkok was to give the impression that we would abandon it. What would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012? What is the future for the Kyoto Protocol?
I am convinced that Europe must adopt a more offensive position, that it must show its arms rather than its intentions. My question, which will be easy for you to answer, is somewhat similar to the one from the Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, since I, too, am convinced that Europe must henceforth ensure that it always includes this climate dimension in all of its trade agreements with third countries, with a European carbon tax if that is the only language that those who refuse to realise the magnitude of the challenge can understand.
I have two questions, Commissioner; one is on the quick-start money. How will you link with Mr Piebalgs to make really sure that this money goes to efficiency, to renewables and, in a decentralised way, to decentralised energy production combining this also with energy poverty? The second question is, how do you bring the large European cities and progressive regions into the game, internationally as well? I was really disappointed that, in last week's EU 2020 paper, cities and regions basically do not exist. How can we even dare to think that we will move Europe forward while ignoring citizens' regions in Europe and the impact they could have internationally?
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first to Mr Leinen, I think it is a very good idea that, whenever delegations do go out, you have the time and priority also to get climate on the agenda. This is very important and it could be very useful to compare notes, so that when you get a piece of information in one country and I get information one month later, we get together sometimes and compare notes so that we can really build on the information that we each receive.
The risk of ending up in some Doha-like process was the very reason why we applied so much pressure for Copenhagen in order to do our utmost to try and avoid that situation. You are also right that it is dangerous now: if we did not make it in Copenhagen, could it then drag on for ever? That is why I would like to see a specific roadmap with exact deliverables for each event, and an exact date on which we have to conclude it. I think that is a very good point.
We are not the problem vis-à-vis the Kyoto Protocol. We delivered before anybody else. We have delivered and lived up to our formal pledges in the first period from 2008 to 2012. We will deliver whatever we have pledged to deliver and we are also ready to continue the Kyoto Protocol. The EU in this context is not the problem. It is other parties that are the problem here and they will have to find out if they want an alternative, should there be one, or how they will cope with the continuation, the second commitment period.
I understand your point on big cities. I think that C40 and lots of other initiatives are very good, and you are also right that much of the emissions will be related to cities and lifestyle in the cities. The challenge here is that much of the planning and other types of tools that can really address these issues often lie with Member States, but I agree with you and I have also worked with some of the major cities prior to Copenhagen. That is an aspect that we should bear in mind and try to see how we can develop it further. Also, for instance, when it comes to transportation and the decarbonisation of transport, it goes without saying that the major cities will be key to finding solutions there.
I disagree greatly with a strategy that is based on accepting at this early stage that we will not get an agreement in Mexico. My question to you is therefore whether that is something you have simply decided, or is it a mandate that you have been given - and if so, who gave you this mandate? Is it the Heads of State? Or is it the codecision procedure, or what? I hope that this strategy can be revised. What good can it do to say 'What if a huge momentum is built up and there are high expectations, and then it all comes to nought - how could we then explain two fiascos?'. Listen, that is not something you need be concerned about. The US and China and others will probably ensure that there are no great expectations of Mexico. The role of the EU should not be to talk down expectations - the EU's role should be to talk up expectations. If we say even before the summit has begun: 'Listen, we are willing to accept that there will not be a particularly great agreement' and so on, then you banish any chance of success before you have even started. It sets a whole new starting point and the agreement will only be the worse because of it.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is definitely a clear 'no' to the latter point on the IPCC. If I should distance myself from everything that is not in this paper, then I would distance myself from a lot of things. This is a way of trying to take for granted that we are facing a challenge, that we have to solve it, and that the EU has to take the lead in terms of how to solve it. That is the thinking behind this paper.
However, we saw something very new in Copenhagen: whereas, in the past, the EU often had only a few partners when going into international negotiations and trying to get things done, this time, leaders representing more than 80% of global emissions in Copenhagen promised that, from now on, they would also be on track. That changes the whole dynamic substantially. May I remind you that to get the emerging economies on board and to get them to be co-responsible has been a European priority for years, and that was actually achieved in Copenhagen.
To Mrs Carvalho: yes, I agree very much that we should prepare both technically and politically, and that we should be better at doing so, not least so that, when we come to the negotiating table, we do not just say what we want and then, when the rest of the world disagrees with us, we do not really know what to do because we have expended all our energy trying to come together on a very firm and detailed formulated position. We should be more flexible in the way we negotiate this.
(DA) ... and then finally to Dan Jørgensen: of course I do not believe that we should not reach an agreement in Mexico. What is under discussion is whether we believe that we can get all the details, including the form of the agreement, in place in Mexico. That is my concern. Viewed in these terms, I believe that we will increase the pressure on the US and China and others precisely by saying that we must have very specific deliverables and that very specific results must be achieved in Cancún. We cannot just put it off.
I am trying to make it difficult for them not to deliver in Mexico. I believe that if we are to achieve this, then we must make sure we do not focus too much on the legal form, because that could well obstruct agreement being reached on the actual content. There are a lot of factors to take into account - 'What do we think? What are we hearing? What do we think it is possible to get the US to agree to just three weeks after they have had mid-term elections?', for example. There are many factors that come into play here, but I believe Mr Jørgensen knows me well enough to realise that it is not because I do not think we should be ambitious in Mexico. We simply need to try to define what the maximum is that we can get out of Mexico. That is the pivotal point of the strategy that I have tried to present here today.
The EU has every opportunity to lead the way in taking action to reduce CO2 emissions. The Copenhagen Summit perhaps left many with a feeling of disappointment due to some of the participants refraining from committing to any definite climate change prevention targets. India and China have recently sent messages to the UN indicating their determination to meet the targets committed to under the Copenhagen Accord, as vague as it was. This is an important sign and the EU can grasp the initiative globally and bring all the states back to the same table, especially the Asian states whose industrial capacity is growing every month. Climate change is a certainty, just as it is a certainty that pollution accelerates it. This justifies the EU's ambitions to set an example in its actions to reduce pollution. Indeed, our aim to become the least polluted region in the world cannot but be to our advantage. The benefits from this include more than just the immediate benefit of a cleaner environment. Redirecting Europe towards a green economy and industry will create jobs, open up new avenues of research and, last but not least, reduce every state's expenditure.
While preserving the earth's atmosphere must be a responsibility shared by different countries, it is also clear that the influence that each of these countries has had on the atmosphere throughout history and the impact which they have today are two very different things, which means that their responsibilities must be differentiated, for reasons of basic justice. Moreover, the definition of responsibility of each country in the global effort to reduce emissions must take into account their respective populations, for the same reasons of fairness. China's per capita emissions are currently four times less that those of the USA and about half the average of EU emissions. India has about a tenth of the average EU emissions and twenty times less than those of the USA. At present in India, there are about 500 million people (roughly the population of the EU) without access to electricity. This is why attempts to blame these countries for the failure of Copenhagen are unreasonable and unfair, not to mention the ridiculous blaming of the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America by a resolution from this House. This position is justified only by sheer political factionalism, which undermines and subverts what actually happened in Copenhagen.
The very persistent lobbying of the European Commission and its President on the matter of an 'ambitious' climate and energy policy, which has been going on for years, is nothing other than an attempt to destroy the EU's industry. This policy is a result either of ignorance made worse by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or of plain stupidity, or it is also the result of excessive cynicism leading to economic sabotage. It is a pity that the Left-wing Members have not realised that this is nothing other than a trap for them, because the greatest number of supporters of emissions trading are being recruited from among those who have caused one crisis already. This time, however, the 'finance bubble' will be significantly bigger. The damage which has already been caused by this suicidal policy is huge, especially in my country of Poland. We do not need a war. It is easier to ruin a country than to rebuild it. I call on the Commission - come to your senses, because what you are doing is not only anti-European, it is anti-humanitarian. What is needed is immediate revision of the climate and energy package. Get to work on this, and stop persuading others to commit economic suicide. A green economy - yes, but that, of course, means recycling of materials and energy, cogeneration, thermomodernisation, sustainable energy where there is no other source, reuse of sewage, nuclear energy, greater energy economy, higher energy efficiency and other things. Do CO2 emissions, therefore, also have any connection with an economy which is 'green' like this? Yes, they do, but paradoxically, when emissions rise ... so that is good.
Madam President, I am grateful to Commissioner Hedegaard for indicating that she understands the basic dilemma of climate policy: the EU cannot make reductions alone, because then not only will our own results be in vain, but we will create the risk that the environment will suffer. If production cannot continue to take place in Europe because of the soaring cost of emissions trading, and if, as a consequence, steel or paper, say, are produced in places where the ensuing emissions are greater than in Europe, emissions will increase overall. Unilateral ambition is not ambition: only when we act together according to the same rules will it be easy to tighten our belts substantially. The basis for this must be a different sort of climate strategy: a consistent cut in specific emissions. That constitutes a system of decarbonisation which is independent of the business cycle and which always rewards the party making the cuts, unlike our current system of emissions trading. China, Japan and the United States of America, among others, are interested in such a scheme, and so the EU too should update its own strategy to reflect the present situation. I would also like to ask if there is any sense in adhering to the emissions trading scheme beyond 2012, as now it appears that there will be no such schemes emerging globally that could be linked to our own. Unless the specification and allocation of emission allowances is proportional, it will be impossible to avoid distortion of competition. When, just under 10 years ago, we began to draft the Emissions Trading Directive, the entire scheme was marketed to us as a means of preparing for emissions trading on a global scale. We acquired the expertise and experience. That experience has definitely cost us dear, and the benefit to the environment is by no means obvious. Reductions in emissions could be made in a way that makes them less exposed to market failure and speculation. Does the Commission think that there are good reasons for carrying on alone?
Madam President, Mrs Hedegaard, the Copenhagen Summit, which we went to as climate change leaders, was a defeat, and showed that it is only Europe which is interested in limiting CO2 emissions. Mrs Hedegaard has announced that, in spite of this fiasco, the fight against global warming is still going to be at the centre of European policy. We are now building a new strategy before the Mexico Summit, so we have to answer the question as to where we went wrong and examine our views and expectations, because the world is not ready, today, to accept such large restrictions. I have, therefore, three questions for Mrs Hedegaard. Firstly, how are we going to negotiate, and what objectives will we set ourselves, so that the Mexico Summit does not end up like the Copenhagen Summit? Secondly, has the European Commission verified the information on global warming and melting icebergs in the context of the misleading and untrue information being given by some scientists? Thirdly, do you agree with my conclusion that without consent to significant reductions in emissions from the USA, China, Russia and India, the efforts of the European Union, and the costs we are incurring, will be wasted?
The fundamental challenge for the European Union after the Copenhagen Summit is to draw up, as quickly as possible, something which is essential - a collective roadmap for the COP 16 summit in Mexico. Copenhagen has made us realise that good intentions are not enough. As a result of Copenhagen, we can come to the following four conclusions. Firstly, the European Union will not be fully effective if it only sets frameworks to be followed. Europe should give developing countries real support which favours the Community's ambitious emissions objectives. Secondly, the European Union must start discussions again with the United States, as part of a transatlantic leadership, and with other leading world powers. Thirdly, the European Union should adopt a more rational approach to the CO2 emissions reduction strategy, with a view to reducing emissions while avoiding high adaptation costs. Fourthly, the European Union should intensify its efforts at building an efficient low-emission economy. Mrs Hedegaard, the question is simple - is there a climate for such change in Europe?
There are two aspects of this worth highlighting. Firstly, investing in greener, low carbon technologies is an important instrument. These investments will protect the environment, while also creating new business opportunities and new jobs. The European Union can play an important role in this sector on the global market. The second aspect is the importance of the 'Resource efficient Europe' flagship initiative. The request made by the Commission for Member States to use the Structural Funds to invest in constructing energy-efficient public buildings certainly provides part of the solution. However, I think that we need to devote at least as much attention to the residential sector, more specifically to the collective residential buildings constructed in the past which were heavy consumers of energy in some Member States, especially those in Eastern Europe.
Essential progress was also made in Copenhagen regarding monitoring, reporting and verification. These link directly to building trust, because such a system will enable us to see that everyone is playing their part and will allow us to determine the effectiveness of our policies and how we should adapt them in the future. The European Union needs to continue to implement its Emission Trading Scheme and other initiatives, such as energy reductions in buildings. We need to meet our emissions targets and show how we can all benefit from energy savings. Providing a successful example of an emission reduction policy which translates into benefits for ordinary people is the best way of convincing others to follow.
Both points are important, but I would like to suggest that it is very important how these problems are going to be solved. Let us be honest with ourselves - after many years of vague political declarations and inactivity, several of us feel an acute need to finally move towards concrete action. I am an uncompromising advocate of human rights and all my statements on the floor of the European Parliament during the past six years have always been in this context. In these six years, I have also listened to several discussions about discrimination against ethnic Roma and the need for solutions to ethnic Roma problems. Despite this abundant debate, we have not been able to take any substantial steps towards concrete solution and I believe this is mainly due to us formally focusing on the technical term discrimination and not addressing the real reasons which are the cause of the current situation, in which our fellow Roma citizens live.
Therefore, if we really want to address the Roma problem, we will have to focus primarily on compliance with both international treaties on domestic law, as well as on international conventions. I am thinking in particular about the Convention of the Rights of the Child, whose provisions are being violated by many Roma families. I am talking about the Slovak Republic, where there are provisions for free care and free education at primary and secondary schools. All this is provided for and financed by the state. Yet even in these two policies, the basic rights of the child are not being respected.
This situation, which affects almost 10 million people at the heart of the European Union, which is now endowed with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and will soon be a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, casts serious doubts over the policy of non-discrimination and effectiveness of rights, both at EU and Member State level. It took the racist violence in Italy in December 2007 to have a large-scale, high-level European mobilisation finally result in the organisation of the first European summit in September 2008.
The third question asks whether the Trio of Presidencies has a strategic proposal or a strategic agenda for this issue. I can confirm that, in the programme drawn up by the Trio of Presidencies, the social and economic integration of Roma people is dealt with explicitly. This intention is laid down in the programme adopted unanimously by the General Affairs Council and is, therefore, in line with the strategy for the next 18 months, which is the period covered by the programme of the Trio of Presidencies.
Finally, with regard to the issue of non-discrimination, it is well known that during the course of its term, the Spanish Presidency, and indeed the Trio of Presidencies, intends to promote the adoption of a directive which, for some time now, has not been adopted or brought to its final conclusion in the European Union: an integrated directive on combating discrimination and promoting equal rights; this is vital, precisely for those groups who suffer particular discrimination and, specifically, the Roma community.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Swoboda and his colleagues for tabling this oral question on the European Roma Summit. It allows the Commission to express its commitment to ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, on the one hand, and full social and economic integration into our societies on the other. We have just heard the Council making a real plea about the way the Member States have to go ahead by putting this in the mainstream of their policies.
This is not an issue that can be solved by a simple slogan. It needs a lot of concrete work. That is why the Commission is encouraging Member States to use the full potential of these funds to support Roma inclusion. To this end, we have launched a series of high-level bilateral visits to Member States with significant Roma populations. They should lead the concrete commitments with agreed targets. The first event took place in October 2009 in Hungary with the full cooperation of the government. Others will be organised in the future.
Another concrete example of the Commission's commitment to using the Structural Funds for tackling Roma exclusion is the amendment that has been proposed to Article 7(2) of the Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund. A very large majority in this House voted for the report by your colleague, Mr van Nistelrooij, at the beginning of last month: a measure which opens new policy and funding opportunities for housing for the benefit of marginalised communities where we can target the Roma specifically, although not exclusively.
Finally, thanks to the European Parliament, there are the pilot projects on Roma inclusion, with a budget of EUR 5 million over two years. This pilot project addresses early childhood education, self-employment through micro credits and public awareness. The evaluation of this pilot project will be carried out jointly by the UNDP and the World Bank. I am very much looking forward to this evaluation because the evaluation will bring us the information about what we have done well and where the deficiencies are so that we can build on this in order to go ahead with a very targeted action afterwards.
The European platform for Roma inclusion was launched as a joint initiative of the Commission and the Czech Presidency in April 2009. Its objective is to bring together relevant actors at European, national and international level, as well as actors from civil society, and make existing policies altogether much more coherent. This platform has led to the elaboration of the common basic principles for Roma inclusion, which is annexed to the Council conclusions on Roma inclusion adopted in June of last year. These conclusions call upon the Commission to take the 10 common basic principles for Roma inclusion into account when designing and implementing policies. Further meetings of the platform are expected to take place under the Spanish Presidency and the Belgian Presidency so it is not a one-off action but it is followed up. I very much welcome the strong commitment of the Trio of Presidencies on this objective because we need to play into each other's hands so that progress can be made. The Commission will continue to contribute to the Trio's actions through its policies and instruments, in close partnership, of course, with Member States and civil society.
In addition to a more effective implementation of the international and national anti-discrimination laws, as we just heard from Commissioner Reding, particular emphasis must be given in Córdoba to the economic aspect of the inclusion of the Roma, because their integration in the labour market and education is a key economic interest of the Member States. In recent years, a number of international organisations have developed forward-looking plans, but they have not been implemented at Member State level due to a lack of binding power, of the prospect of potential sanctions and of appropriate budget allocations.
The European Union is capable of ensuring the development, appropriate enforcement and assessment based on clear indicators of a non-mandatory Community strategy going beyond 'soft law' measures. As European Parliament rapporteur on the European Roma strategy, I believe that it is particularly important for the strategy to define the crisis areas within Member States which require immediate intervention. Social disadvantages are unevenly spread across geographical regions, with extreme poverty and social exclusion concentrated in certain micro-regions densely populated by Roma and non-Roma. This creates serious obstacles in the way of the social development of Europe. These regions should be removed from a competition which is unfair to them, and their development should be started by using intensive programmes adjusted to their own particular needs.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the supervision and monitoring of the strategy should be the responsibility of local organisations. I also suggest extensive surveys on the needs of local target groups, similar to the agricultural projects in Ireland. In order to be able to evaluate the results of the programme, it is also indispensable to collect statistical data broken down by ethnic groups and evaluate them independently. According to the European People's Party, these are the essential issues which the Córdoba Summit should address.
Mr President, it is both good and necessary for this House to concern itself about the fate of the Roma. In the last few centuries, discrimination has been possibly the least of the ills that have befallen them. It is necessary to use European funds and European directives to promote the integration of the Roma and to eliminate their disadvantaged position. I also think it important to develop a good strategy to ensure that the European millions really reach the people who need them. The emphasis here must lie on education. We must equip the Roma children to break out of the negative cycle that is an unfortunate reality.
Mr President, in December 2009, when I was in Pristina and Mitrovica and saw how people are living in the Mahala and, in particular, in the lead-contaminated camps, I was rather shocked, particularly about the plight of the children. In almost every conversation I had, I was told that, not only in Kosovo, but also in many countries in Europe, the situation is dire for one of the oldest population groups in Europe, namely the Roma. I met Bekim Syla from the Roma and Ashkali Documentation Centre in Pristina, who received us with the words 'We are tired of talking'.
Action needs to be taken, and therefore our absolute highest expectation of the Córdoba Summit is that there will be more than mere talk and that action will be taken immediately. Immediate action means not resting on our laurels behind the EU directives implementing the principle of equal treatment, of equal treatment of persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin, and also the Employment Framework Directive, because it will not do any good. Immediate action requires the recognition and assumption that these directives are not sufficient to protect the Roma in the European Union from degrading and discriminatory treatment and - most importantly - to enable their permanent integration. What we need, therefore, is a European Roma strategy that is a component of all policy areas - an integral component of all policies.
However, the majority of governments implement projects that are merely sporadic measures. What we need are medium and long-term political initiatives. We urgently need measures for the economic development of the Roma communities. The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funding more flexible; it must do so now, so that the Roma can also benefit from it. This includes micro-credit loans, which need to be issued with as little bureaucracy as possible, for example, for the reconstruction of Roma settlements. It includes very specific measures for the promotion of health and for education, training and the development of the labour market. I would like to make it quite clear that no child should fail because of educational or language barriers. The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left does not want Roma schools, but schools for everyone, where the Roma can also live and learn.
I would like to add that this is not only about the money, but also about taking decisive measures to counter racism. Antiziganism must not be regarded as or remain a trivial offence, but must be punished as a crime. The EU bears a lot of the responsibility for the extent to which, it is to be hoped, we will soon succeed in bringing about justice for the more than 10 million Roma in Europe, because it starts with justice and should continue with equality. For this, we need a very clear political 'yes' and a resolute, powerful European framework strategy, and - quite frankly - it also needs our passionate commitment, as MEPs and as people, to this population group - the Roma and Sinti. Let us take action now.
Historians say the Roma came to Europe between the 5th and 9th centuries AD, and many European nations have been looking since then for a way to coexist with the Roma in the best way possible. It needs to be objectively acknowledged that even after a thousand years of searching for such a model, we have failed to find a way to integrate the Roma properly into our society. I do not know whether the cause of the persistent problems lies with us or on the other side, but after experiences in my country, I know for sure that to help them only by giving makes no sense.
So what is the result? Modern dwellings have been destroyed while sanitary facilities and other furnishings are being dismantled and stolen. Sewage and rubbish are being thrown by the people in these flats out the window directly into the street. They do not want to go to work, even if the local government offers it to them. Medical workers who have been bringing them protection against infectious diseases are chased out of the Roma settlements. Children are neglected, hungry and often even do not go to school. Therefore, I am convinced that if we want to really help the Roma, we will have to endeavour first of all to teach Roma children a civilised, cultured and decent way of life.
Generations of Gipsy in certain regions of Hungary have grown up in families living on benefits rather than earning a living. There is no way out without creating jobs. This is why we must break away from neoliberal economic policies. Even the difficult social situation cannot justify the violation of the law. In Hungary, Gypsies are involved in a very high percentage of crime. We have to act against this not only for the benefit of the majority of society, but also for the benefit of the honest Gipsy people. We have never specified genetic or ethnic labels as a reason. So there is no mention of racism, we only mentioned special socio-cultural circumstances as a background. If we routinely stigmatise persons stating this as racists, we only pursue an ostrich policy.
(ES) Mr President, I shall begin by congratulating Mrs Járóka on defending the Roma population within European Union institutions. It should be pointed out that Mrs Járóka and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have designed the first European strategy for the integration of the Roma minority, proposing specific Community actions to benefit over nine million citizens living in the European Union. The Roma population's situation is different from that of other national minorities in Europe, which is why we need to adopt specific measures concerning them.
Finally, Member States are responsible for promoting measures to combat the discrimination so often suffered by the Roma. Access to health care, quality education, further training and professional retraining are indispensable goals for Roma people to be able to achieve decent employment and full participation in civil society. In that regard, it is vital for local authorities to participate, and I know very well what I am talking about. We must do everything we can for them, but nothing can be done without them, and in this Chamber, Mr President, we already have some excellent Roma Members.
(HU) I believe that the second Roma Summit in Córdoba provides an excellent opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved in the past few years concerning the integration of the largest and most vulnerable ethnic minority in Europe, the Roma. First of all, I would like to emphasise that we have made very important steps to make this a European issue. This is not just a Central and Eastern European issue, but rather an all-European issue. In order to be able to find solutions, we have to use the same approach in the future. Important steps have been taken by the European Parliament by passing a resolution on the necessity of the Roma strategy. Unfortunately, this has not been adopted yet and we sincerely hope that further significant steps will be made during the mandate of the Trio Presidency and this Commission. The 2009 report of the European Parliament on the social and labour market situation of the Roma was an important landmark, and we are half-way through the Decade of Roma Inclusion, which is also an important programme. In order to make our strategy successful, we need to see the extent to which the structural and cohesion funds have been utilised, and whether and in which circumstances they contributed to the social integration of the Roma. We need data, but we are aware that the data on ethnic origin are always sensitive, and we must be cautious when requesting and handling them. While numerous positive steps have been made, we also note that the enforcement of readmission agreements has also raised numerous problems. Kosovo has already been mentioned here. I sincerely hope that the summit will contribute to solving these issues.
(FR) Mr President, the Roma issue is being keenly felt in my region, the west of France. In Nantes, over 1 000 Roma are being expelled from one place after another due to a lack of government regulated sites in which to accommodate them. The few municipalities with facilities to accommodate the Roma, for example, Rezé and Indre, located in the Nantes conurbation, are stretched to the limit and lack the support of the public authorities. The most proactive and open mayors are therefore facing enormous difficulties. Responses cannot be local. They must be global. Inclusion of the Roma must be incorporated in every European Union policy in order to put an end to the discrimination suffered by these European citizens.
I would also like to draw attention to the specific situation of the women. The problems faced by Roma women are particularly striking, for example, in relation to marital violence or unwanted pregnancies. In France then, according to Médecins du monde, one in two Roma women, or 43% of that group, will have had an abortion by the age of 22. The average age for the first pregnancy is 17. Only 10% of Roma women use contraception. The European Union must therefore include the gender perspective in all studies and laws that concern the Roma. Education must be a major priority. We must act urgently with the Roma communities to make them aware of their fundamental rights and to facilitate their access to public services.
(MT) I would also like to extend my support, in particular, to MEP Lívia Járóka, who has worked incessantly on this sensitive and important subject. Mr President, as my fellow Member said, the situation of the Roma population in Europe is one which does not only concern a limited number of countries. It is a situation which concerns the entire European Union since the Roma community are the largest ethnic minority in Europe. In this light, it is necessary that we evaluate what the European Union is currently doing in order to see how we can do things in a better way. I was pleased to listen to the Vice-President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, give us a full explanation on this matter. And this is a good time to do so in view of the Roma Summit which will be held in Córdoba in the coming month. What is certain is that we cannot leave the situation unchanged because it will not resolve itself and if we do not take the necessary steps, these people will remain marginalised and caught in a poverty trap. We must therefore adopt an integration policy which leads to the Roma community truly having access to the opportunities available to others. In particular, the opportunity to work, to exploit their capabilities, to live a dignified life and to be successful must be provided to these people. Thus, not only will they be able to support themselves but also to contribute to the societies where they live. However, in order to achieve this, we must take the necessary steps to remove the existing obstacles. I hope that our message in this Chamber, in this Parliament, our message of solidarity with the Roma people, is received in view of next month's summit.
This is another reason for this Parliament to be active on this issue. The Greens differ, however, and we will not be proud if all Member States do not admit that we can do better on the Roma issue. Issues like this one have to form part of a joint call for a European strategy for Roma inclusion. We need that strategy; we need that strategy because the European Union is also losing credibility at international level. Many countries are singling us out because of this issue. This is important as well because, even in the past, we understood that this is something that has to do with human rights and social inclusion.
Children account for 46% of the Roma population, due to the combined effect of a high birth rate and, unfortunately, a low life expectancy. Access to education would provide them with a real opportunity. Although access and entitlement to an education are guaranteed by European regulations, the majority of children belonging to poor Roma communities do not attend school at all or drop out. One specific measure would be to include these children and young people in the compulsory schooling system, thereby preventing them from dropping out of school. In the 2009-2010 school year, the Romanian Ministry of Education allocated 7 483 special places in the country's secondary schools, with only 2 460 pupils registering for them, of which 2 246 were admitted.
One, but not the only, example is taking Roma children away from their families and putting them in separate boarding schools. These measures do not solve problems: they lead, rather, to more segregation, and impact deeply and negatively on the lives of Roma families. Europe needs an effective long-term Roma strategy. This summit gives us a new opportunity for affirmative action, different from the first Roma Summit, which did not include real political commitments in the EU. The EU should start by setting a good example, by offering more positions to Roma people and including Roma and civil society in the strategy.
(HU) As a developer of the first medium-term government programme for Europe on the Roma issue and the rapporteur of the 2002 Roma report of the Council of Europe, I agree with those stating that this is one of the most complex issues of Europe today. I do not envy Commissioner Reding's position, because this is currently the most complex issue in Europe. Evidently, the Roma are not simply an ethnic and national minority, but are also a multiply disadvantaged social minority. However, the distribution of responsibility between the majority and the minority is not evident. The social responsibility is asymmetrically distributed between the majority and the minority, because the majority has far more responsibility, but the minority, in this case the Roma, also has its own responsibility. The fourth and particularly important point is that we need integration without assimilation.
Finally, this is not simply a budgetary issue and it does not depend merely on resources. This is an issue of whether there are people and mechanisms in place, both in the majority society and among the Roma. As a former Secretary of State, I have to say that results were achieved in regions where there were local majority leaders committed to the issue, and credible local minority leaders capable of motivating the minority and supported by NGOs. It is not a funding issue. We need the European level, but success is to be reached at Member State and local level. This is why I support the strategy of the Union.
In my view, the lack of prospects for the young generation is one of the biggest problems we are facing. The Roma population is a young population with a significant proportion of them under the age of 20. In the society based on knowledge and innovation which Europe wants to develop, if we fail to take immediate measures, the gaps between young Roma and the rest of the population will grow. Children and young people are included in few of the current policies and strategies, even though the large number of children and young people in the Roma population makes them the generation of change. The process of sustainable development must start from a generation of children who have access to education, medical aid and all the opportunities which children from the majority population enjoy.
This is why I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Commission proposal on the EU 2020 strategy does not contain any objectives for resolving the problems of the Roma community. If we are not going to take specific measures and if we are not going to make major changes in terms of approach, millions of young Roma will continue to face social exclusion and marginalisation throughout their entire lives. The lack of hope will turn these communities into areas of insecurity for their inhabitants and the rest of the population. We must offer the Roma community a real chance to change their prospects. Solidarity is the fundamental value at the heart of the European project. This is why we must shift from the political will to taking measures to actually put them into practice.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, according to a recent public opinion survey, 76% of Czechs do not want to have Roma as neighbours. Over the past 10 years or more, I have addressed in my everyday political life as a mayoress the problems of coexistence and neighbourly relations between Roma and non-Roma citizens in my home town. As a consequence, I firmly believe that financial solutions are not the answer, which is anyway clear from the unimpressive overall results of the EU-funded projects to date aimed at improving the socio-economic situation of the Roma.
In my opinion, the solution can lie only in the cohesion of local communities in towns and villages, which must accept Roma as fully-fledged citizens for better or for worse. However, the same applies in reverse. The Roma, too, must have a sense of belonging to their community and accept its rules and standards. Their own positive examples and role models are enormously important for relations with the majority community and for effective work within the Roma community. It is fundamental, however, for there to be a consistent and uncompromising fight against xenophobia and racism in society at large. Let us make it absolutely clear, through all possible resources, concrete actions and positions, that these are totally unacceptable for us. We should make a common effort in this direction in the future.
(SL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, first of all, I should like to congratulate Spain on adding this summit to its list of priorities. At the same time, allow me also to congratulate the Commission for deciding to prepare a comprehensive report on the position of the Roma in Europe. It is testimony to the fact that we are aware of how topical this issue is. However, it has only become topical in recent years, with the enlargement of the European Union.
I come from a country with a large Roma community and I welcome that today we are acknowledging that the Roma issue is an issue for the whole of Europe to deal with. A strategy is in force in Romania, which dates back before the country joined the EU, aimed at improving the Roma's situation. Special places are provided to them free at public universities, which is helping greatly to raise the level of education and culture among the members of this community. National and local public authorities are making efforts to promote social inclusion of the Roma and to integrate them into the labour market in order to combat dire poverty and provide them with access to health care services. However, consistent financial support is required from Europe in order to achieve the desired results.
(HU) For Gipsy children, Roma children, the only way to break out of their situation is to attend school on a regular basis. Unfortunately, we regularly hear, as a manifestation of political correctness, excuses made on various grounds for parents who do not encourage or even prevent their children's school attendance. From this point of view, girls, Gipsy girls, are particularly subject to and victims of discrimination, because their irresponsible parents often burden them with looking after their many brothers and sisters and doing household chores instead of going to school. The only approach in line with international human rights standards is if the government undertakes the obligation to step up in such cases and defend the rights of the child through penalties, sanctions or, if necessary, by withdrawing family benefit or other forms of assistance to make parents respect the rights of the child.
I also agree that it is necessary to eliminate the hidden and overt discrimination of Roma. However, I am also in favour of speaking quite openly about how the rights of Roma children are being repressed by their own parents. Everybody has a right to a dignified life. Roma children, to a predominant degree, do not have that. At the next summit, let us also talk about how the Roma themselves, above all, must be active in solving their own problems; first, regarding the education of their children, but also about their personal involvement in the process of improving their own living conditions. And since I do not want to be a Commissioner in the future, I want to say here in this room that we should also be speaking at the next summit about how support for the Roma is being abused by the Roma themselves.
To my mind, some of those actions should focus on specific issues faced by the Roma people: the discrimination they suffer as Roma, such as the difficulty they have in accessing public services and employment. We must also look at the issue of Roma women, who suffer particular problems of poverty, access to housing, discrimination and violence; and the problem of young Roma, too, for their lack of qualifications makes it even more difficult for them to gain access to employment during this time of economic crisis. There is also the issue of Roma children: it is said that their life expectancy is 10 years shorter than that of the average European child.
At the same time, however, we need to take general action that benefits the Roma population as a whole; they are one of the communities that suffers from the worst discrimination, and so any anti-discrimination policy is going to help them. This is also the case with the action being taken against gender violence, which is why it is so important that, as soon as possible, we have the directive on the protection order that will combat gender violence, for this action will particularly benefit Roma women; that is also the case with the directive on non-discrimination, which will particularly benefit the Roma population.
Now, we do have instruments; we do have policies. The question is, how do we utilise them? How do we mainstream the question and the problems of the Roma in these instruments and policies? I believe that we do not need a Roma Directive or a Roma Fund. What we need is to take Roma issues fully into account when we apply EU law and when we implement EU funds. The key to this - and it has been said by many of you - is partnership and the cooperation of all the key actors. The Commission pursues this approach in the European platform for Roma inclusion and with its internal procedures.
But I would also like to underline very clearly that, while, of course, Roma exclusion has a lot to do with fundamental rights, mostly it has to do with social and economic issues. For instance, I would like to quote the World Bank's study on the economic cost of Roma exclusion and to see that this is a very important piece of evidence showing that we need to find solutions for the sake of our society in general. So to apply the instruments which we have in the most effective manner possible will need a strategic approach, of course - mainstream, as some of you have said. This approach is based on cooperation, on mobilisation of the necessary resources and on a strategy learning from success as well as from failure.
What we must avoid doing is creating a strategy which exists only on paper. Results are needed; results which lead to the integration of Roma into mainstream schools. I have heard many of you speaking about schooling. I am looking forward to seeing the details of our action on pre-schooling, how this has been working out. The mainstream labour market; here, my colleague, Mr Andor, is going to look for precise targets to be achieved, and the mainstream society which is the responsibility of all our policies.
(HU) Mr President, We have a technical problem. I have just noticed that the computer cloned me, because my name, the Tabajdi name, appeared for my colleagues who had cards inserted. I noticed it in the case of Mrs Gomez, and elsewhere, as well. So there must be some problem with the computer. My fellow Member, Mrs Kinga Göncz, also has the name Tabajdi displayed on the card. Please check it, as I do not want to have so many clones in the European Parliament. Please inform the technical service. Thank you. Zoli, is it the same for you?
I would like to underline that by sharing responsibility for preventing discrimination against Roma and for aiding their integration into society, the Roma issue has become part of European human rights policy. Therefore, as we approach the second European Roma Summit in Córdoba, we must discuss the social problems faced by Roma and the means of solving these problems. I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency is hosting this summit, since we must raise and acknowledge the existence of Roma issues. I would like to underline that in a democratic and free society, it is unacceptable that a group of people are isolated from society and that people's fundamental rights and freedoms are openly violated. Members of the Roma community face racist attacks, unequal access to public services and social provisions and huge living and educational segregation. Moreover, we must draw attention to the fact that Roma not only experience direct discrimination, but face implicit, indirect discrimination, for example, the failure to employ Roma and, at the same time, their non-integration into social life. Therefore, I agree that we must call on the European Commission to encourage Member State governments and regional and local authorities to better implement EU projects in respect of Roma. I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe.
in writing. - Statistics show that unfortunately, Roma are the most hated and discriminated ethnic minority in Europe. We have seen the difficulties that several Member States, including mine, have concerning the social inclusion of the Roma. This clearly shows that this is a broader European issue that we must handle together. Better access to education and employment is crucial so that we avoid the tendency of Roma to choose other more easier but harmful ways of money making. We need to fully apply the anti-discrimination legislation to Roma people and to take further initiatives to integrate them in our society. So far, we haven't had any coherent strategy. I wish that this Second European Roma Summit brings about a real EU strategy for Roma. Structural and pre-accession funds should be more efficiently used to finance such initiatives. I would also like to insist on the fact that this strategy should be a tool of coordination and an impetus for the Member States. The initiatives have to be taken at local level and benefit from the expertise of local NGOs and Roma themselves who know what the main difficulties are, so that this strategy really meets Roma people's needs.
We are halfway through the ten-year period (2005-2015) devoted to Roma inclusion. What we can see is that a great deal is being said about the Roma minority, various programmes and platforms are being created, but the results are limited. The problems associated with education, employment, regional development, etc. persist and are getting worse in some Member States. The second Roma Summit being held this year in Córdoba is intended to revitalise the European aspect and find new courses of action. I agree that the principles need to be redefined, but I believe that we should devise instead a transversal, horizontal strategy which will tackle this minority's problems in an integrated, but not exclusive manner. The most important aspect is that the pre-accession funds and Structural Funds are used properly and yield the results which we would like as political decision makers, and which civil society and, above all, the Roma minority, would like.
The first Roma Summit had at least one positive outcome: the conclusion reached at Community level that the Roma need education as a first step towards social integration. In this respect, I also welcome the second meeting of the European Platform for Roma Inclusion devoted exclusively to the issue of Roma education in Europe. The process of educational reform requires the involvement of not only State institutions but also of non-governmental organisations which no longer need to make it their main objective to identify acts of discrimination, but to educate ethnic groups. Reducing illiteracy, ensuring children complete their schooling and the need for vocational training and retraining offer opportunities for accessing the labour market as well as means of social inclusion. It is clear that we urgently need positive development among this minority, but this is something which both the authorities and the Roma community itself are responsible for. The second Roma Summit must motivate the European Commission sufficiently to come up with legislative proposals aimed at achieving tangible results in this area. The European Commission must also review the Social Fund and propose an increase in funding for projects aimed at improving the socio-economic situation of the largest minority in the European Union.
The Roma Summit in Córdoba is intended to be an opportunity to talk plainly about the parallel societies in Europe and this should be based on efficient integration at all levels. It should be promoted at national as well as at European level. However, there is one thing that we should not forget in this regard, and that is that, for effective integration, both sides need to work together. The Roma people must also do their bit for integration and work from the inside to prevent the creation of parallel societies. In this regard, I am particularly concerned about the school education of children, in particular, of girls. In the middle of Europe, it must not be the case that children are barely or not at all integrated into the existing school system and then drop out of school early in large numbers. Their future position in the labour market is jeopardised considerably as a result and they then take refuge on the edge of society to an even greater extent, thereby isolating themselves. Problems relating to social security and their living conditions are then predetermined and the vicious circle is complete. It is therefore crucial to appeal to the Roma in Europe to change their archaic attitude to school education and women's rights, to actively fight to combat their own exclusion, and to work to integrate themselves into society and into the labour market in particular.
Although Member States have already spent significant EU and national resources on creating jobs for long-term unemployed Roma people, a coherent European-level solution has not been found: Member States faced the situation in different ways and to different degrees. I believe that it is important to elaborate a coherent and efficient strategy to resolve the Roma issue, which has remained unsolved to this day and represents a common problem of the European Union as a legal entity and the Member States. The most important issue of the European Roma Summit, to be held on 8 April in Córdoba, should be the formulation of the principles of the European-level strategy, to prevent any further 'migration' of the Roma issue and to enable all Member States to find a solution based on the common European strategy. I am convinced that the basic tool for tackling this is education. I consider it necessary to develop a comprehensive programme package that promotes and encourages the return of young Roma intellectuals into the community and their work within the framework of the community and for the community. Building a close partnership between different Roma advocacy organisations, responsible State institutions, the civil society and cooperating EU institutions could support this to a great extent. A more significant role should be given to methods of granting subsidised micro credits or interest repayments by the State. Access of Roma communities to the conditions required to earn their livelihood should be an important target within the concept of agricultural subsidies. The situation is more serious than one would believe: the ratio of long-term unemployed has grown by leaps and bounds among the Roma, and more and more of them become marginalised.
Here we are, nine years later, debating the fact that 21 Member States had, by October 2009, failed to enact these directives and have now been sent reasoned opinions because of this failure. It beggars belief that, as we approach the revision of the first railway package, a number of states - including so-called influential states, including states that like to inform us of their pro-European credentials - have failed to enact this significant piece of European legislation. Those Member States should hang their heads in shame and remember and honour the obligations they gave to this Parliament in 2001.
This oral question is born out of a frustration, a frustration that the law is being deliberately flouted and that as yet, the Commission has failed to bring Member States to book. We are now demanding to know what aspects in each failing Member State of each directive have not been enacted. We need to know why certain Member States have not correctly implemented these directives. We want to know which Member States are still resisting the concept of fair competition in the railway sector and deliberately protecting their own national companies.
We have concerns regarding the powers and independence of regulators and infrastructure managers in some of these Member States. We believe the lack of transparency and lack of harmonisation on infrastructure charges is leading to a protectionist practice and is acting as a break on delivering the single market to the railway sector, as well as stifling cross-border activity. If you add to this various national measures such as rolling stock taxes, then you have to question whether certain Member States ever intended to implement these directives in the first place.
Liberalisation was intended to allow new players onto the market. That was the theory. In practice, things look rather different in this regard, too. Today, we are in a position in which - whether we are for or against liberalisation in this area - we have to assess this liberalisation and we are faced with the problem that it has largely not been transposed. The companies themselves - as we have seen in various countries - have made decisions in the name of liberalisation relating to staffing and technology that were not always pleasant, even though this liberalisation had not been transposed.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the hearing in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I was very pleased to hear you say that the greatest thing that we have been able to achieve in Europe is mobility and freedom of movement for the people. With regard to the freedom of movement as well as the internal market, you also mentioned that it is essential not only for people to be able to move from A to B, but for goods to be able to do so too. In 1992, we adopted the internal market de facto in the European Parliament and, with the first railway package in 2001, we also created the conditions for the free internal market in the railway sector. It has already been said that it is now 2010 and we still do not have this in place. It is, in fact, shameful that 21 states are still setting up obstacles. This is protectionism - that has already been mentioned as well - and it is most regrettable that this is the case.
I am also eager to see when you might be able to carry out this revision of the directive. I would also like to urge you specifically - and this has already been said by previous speakers - to be strict with the Member States. We of course come from different Member States, but within the transport sector, we are all agreed that it is very important finally to bring some order here. You are a new Commissioner so you are not to blame for what has - or has not - been done in the past. You therefore have a unique opportunity now to make progress relatively quickly in the railway sector and really take the internal market forward, and with it all European citizens, too. I am counting on this and I am already looking forward to seeing what you are going to do in the near future.
Whilst awaiting your answers, Commissioner, I can only urge you to adopt a prudent attitude, which does not force the matter, which takes the holistic approach that you mentioned, which fully and objectively assesses the previous packages, but which makes a full assessment before taking the next step. This assessment must therefore be thorough and must include the issues of working conditions, security and safety, public service obligations and the lack of internalisation of external costs, before any further progress is made in the liberalisation process.
I should therefore be interested to hear what your priorities are in relation to this matter, given that some progress has been made - it has to be recognised and others have spoken about it - namely, improved transparency in accounts reporting, progress on interoperability, harmonisation of training and licences, and improved signalling and safety. Much remains to be done, however, and I shall insist on a prudent, thorough assessment that is free from taboos so that we do not progress too quickly to the following stages.
Ladies and gentlemen, when the European regulatory framework for railways was approved, we all hoped that it would lead to greater transparency in the financing of this sector of the economy and that new opportunities would be created for the involvement of new players. It seemed that the European rail transport sector was standing on the threshold of a new era. However, the hoped-for market liberalisation failed to materialise. As we all know, in 21 Member States, including the Czech Republic, there has been no proper implementation of the first railway package, while questions remain unresolved relating, in particular, to the opening of railway markets to economic competition.
The situation in the Czech Republic provides evidence of the fact that there is a real problem. Although the state has now taken the first steps, which allow the entry of other rail transport operators onto the market, in reality, the political will for allowing real competition on the railways is lacking. This is confirmed by the behaviour of the socialist leaders of various regions who, at the end of last year, concluded ten-year agreements with Czech rail company, České dráhy, with the option of a further five years for the provision of regional rail services, and all this without any form of public tender. Local leaders, who won four-year mandates in the elections, have therefore actually closed the railway market for 15 years. The monopoly holder, České dráhy, will not now be forced to improve its services in any way whatsoever, and this will have fatal consequences for the railways.
In this context, there is therefore a question as to whether the current debate on taxing employment benefits, which trade unionists have opened up in the Czech Republic, and the related threat of strikes, only serves in reality to distract attention from the real issues. The result of these issues is that rail transport is increasingly being relegated to the periphery of social and economic concern, while, on the contrary, road transport, so heavily criticised by the Greens, is logically growing in popularity. I would therefore like to urge the European Commission to increase its efforts to promote genuine liberalisation of the rail sector and to monitor closely whether the non-market behaviour of various actors is in accordance with European law.
I would like to begin by saying that I completely disagree with Mr Vlasák, whose government has also participated in what he himself is criticising. Now to the matter in hand. As the objective of this railway package was to open up the rail transport market by separating infrastructure, passenger transport and freight transport, it is possible to find out relatively easily whether the Member States, following transition periods of varying lengths, have fulfilled the formal requirements of the directive. What is not so easy to find out, and what the directive does not focus on, are the varying safety regulations of the individual states, the minimal conformity of work conditions for the crews that are manning the trains and the workers securing the operation of the infrastructure and the many differences in technical regulations. The ERTMS is supposed to be a magic formula that should technically unify both infrastructure and rolling stock. I am therefore looking forward to a clear answer concerning the compatibility of the EU rail network with the ERTMS standard. I have not heard one yet.
In any assessment, it is essential that importance be attached to the subject of safety. Have we learned from the recent negative experiences and will these be taken into account? That is my question. On this issue, the Commission is far too reticent towards the public, who are extremely concerned. This applies to quality, too. I would like to ask the Commission to consider how generally binding quality criteria can be set. A great deal has been said about inadequate quality, but it is not possible to measure this reliably. The lack of investment, which you have already mentioned, Commissioner, is also regrettable. Despite Cohesion Fund cofinancing, in most countries, investment in roads is still significantly higher than in the rail system. I would like, in this context, to mention ERTMS - this system categorically must be introduced across Europe for the network, but also for the rolling stock, in order to improve route safety.
I wish to draw your attention to the fact that, due to the crisis, thousands of redundancies have been made in the rail transport sector, which may have an adverse impact on European rail transport. The ERTMS was implemented at the end of last year along approximately 2 700 km of railway lines in the European Union and it will be implemented along 24 000 km of railway lines by 2020. This means huge investment is required, and we are expecting, Commissioner, new solutions and financial instruments that are capable of providing the necessary funding, as well as investment in the appropriate modernisation of the rolling stock.
If only one or two Member States had not introduced this first package, we would be able to impose sanctions today and fulminate in this Chamber, but if twenty-something Member States have not introduced this package, then perhaps the package - to put it mildly - is not the best. Perhaps the cause lies here, or the problem is this. If I hear substantial criticism a moment ago from my fellow Member from the United Kingdom, and in fact, that country has introduced the package, one might wonder if use of the package is, in fact, completely appropriate.
There is, of course, the other side of the coin - in the context of accidents, which we also spoke about, here, two hours ago, during Question Time with the Commission. I am thinking of the matter of safety. From this point of view, safety is, indeed, increased. The Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kallas, drew attention to a significant problem when he said that a number of Member States are not investing in railways and that the possibilities for investment in infrastructure are not being realised. One such country is my country of Poland where, in the last two years, there has been a kind of collapse in terms of financing of the railways, with all the results that this brings.
Each passing day proves this: the separation of the infrastructure from the business of transport imposed by the directives so as to enable the system to be opened up to brutal competition is a technical and organisational nonsense that is costly both to taxpayers and to users. Whilst it is useful to the big corporations, it is dislocating public transport and is responsible for the declining state of the network and of safety. The directives mentioned also destroy jobs and constitute a theft of public property for the benefit of private interests.
There is no doubt that implementation of new railway rules into the various national laws may bring certain problems and price rises. However, it is definitely in our common interest to have well-organised transport and a well-operating rail transport structure as a meaningful alternative, in particular, to road transport, which undoubtedly places a very significant burden on our environment. Therefore, it is certainly correct to speak openly about the problems that have been hampering more rapid development of rail transport. Not just rules though, but also an insight into the future may be in our interest.
European railways from three points of the compass end in coastal ports, while in the eastern direction, the railway lines run as far as the Pacific. Good links between European railways on the EU's eastern border would open new opportunities for European carriers to transport goods. And therefore, if high-speed rail lines could be successfully extended from Paris to Vienna and Bratislava in the near future and, at the same time, a wide-gauge line could be extended from Čierna and Tisou at the Ukrainian border to Bratislava and Vienna, then three different railway systems - classic rail, high-speed and wide-gauge - would meet at a section between Bratislava and Vienna. In conjunction with two airports - Vienna and Bratislava, two ports on the Danube River - Vienna and Bratislava again, and motorway junctions, a new and important logistics and transportation hub is being created right in the centre of Europe.
The first point, in my opinion, is the liberalisation of railway transport to create competition and stimulate competitiveness, obviously with clear and transparent rules for all, as has already been mentioned. The second key point is interoperability between the Member States and between the various internal modes of railway transport. The third point is, of course, safety, and safety certification has to be a prerequisite for obtaining a licence to operate. Still on the subject of safety, and in view of the common market, it is not enough to penalise the inefficiency of the States relative to the regulatory bodies: the powers of the European Railway Agency need to be broadened so as to give it greater authority over inspections and controls.
Yet I would ask you this, Commissioner: when an outlying country is separated from Europe by a mountain range more than 500 kilometres in length - the Pyrenees - which railways can only cross at either end and which requires the axles to be changed on every train that crosses the border, on account of the different track width passed on to us by a long history of autarchies, what can possibly be the incentive for other operators to cross the border with France when there are so many obstacles? Even though Deutsche Bahn has bought Transfesa, it is still having a difficult time.
I do appreciate that UKIP have no idea with regard to manners and parliamentary procedure; this was evident recently in Brussels. However, as a democrat adhering to democratic principles and procedures, I presented this oral question on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism as its Chair, which it is my proud duty to do. That is why I delivered it as such, so I really do not think I should be subjected to abuse from the other side of the Chamber from that group of rogues.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me simply tell you about a personal experience. I live on an important rail route - the route via the Brenner Pass to Verona. The Italian national railways have been neglecting both goods and passenger transport here for years. Austrian railways now travel this route five times a day. However, no timetables for this are provided at Italian railway stations, nor do they issue tickets. Now, the reconstruction of this route at a cost of around EUR 20 billion is currently being considered and the European Union has also invested a lot of money in this. So we can see how absurd things sometimes are in this area. It is not always the very big things that make the issue complicated; sometimes it is the small things.
As in other instances of liberalisation, the process begins by making the most out of the fact that something does not operate well at a particular time, neglecting the real causes of such situations, particularly the years of persistent policies of dismantling and neglecting the public sector, in order to justify liberalising measures and to promote the aforementioned competition, without any real reflection on how or why it will improve matters. Experience, as we have already heard here today, shows us quite the opposite: liberalisation is the cause of, and not the solution to, the principal problems of the sector, most obviously of all those relating to the quality and accessibility of the services and the rights of workers.
This first railway package has very good intentions: to remove barriers and to improve the conditions for better functioning of transport. We will pursue the same goal with the recasting of the package. The problem is not that the package was bad, but that implementation was insufficient. Barriers still exist and resistance to removing barriers is still very strong. We must change the old system of state-owned monopolies with great privileges and no interoperability. We must change that system and improve interoperability. That is the purpose of developing this railway reform.
These issues must and will be addressed in the recasting of the railway package, and perhaps in other strategic documents as well. Adequate financing remains a very big problem, and we need to find innovative ways to finance the bottlenecks. Many Members mentioned the need for investment. We must combine all possible tools and find new tools to pinpoint resources for investment in railways, including modern traffic management systems, booking systems for buying tickets in the same way as for air transport, and also better connect eastern Europe to western Europe, which is another substantial problem.
I welcome the fact that by announcing the first railway package, the European Commission started a process which can be considered as the first step in harmonising railway services within Europe. However, the fact that the transposition of the three directives included in the package caused serious problems for 21 Member States created a serious difficulty which could hinder the proper transposition of any further packages. I draw the European Commission's attention to a contradiction between the high level of economic and efficiency requirements laid down in connection with railway systems in Europe, on the one hand, and the positive effect of the railway on regional development, improving the mobility of rural populations and people with disabilities, and the environment, on the other. I suggest that the Commission resolves this contradiction by finding an appropriate balance and compromise, bearing in mind the clarification of the principle of cost sharing between Member States and the European Union, and the importance of establishing harmonised transport within the EU. A healthy competition involving all participants of the industry should be developed, where the actual competition is between individual and public transportation rather than between the different modes of public transport.
A problem for the proper functioning of the railway market in the new Member States and, in turn, a factor which restricts liberalisation of the market, is the incorrect financing of the railways, in other words, a lack of sufficient means to maintain the railway infrastructure. This results in high access prices and, as a consequence, restricts the competitiveness of this branch of the transportation industry because of the high costs of transport. A further problem is the underfunding of services which are a public service, a result of which is the debts of companies operating in the passenger sector. This then limits the possibilities for investment, for example, in new rolling stock. In the context of appropriate regulation of the European railway market, it is essential to strengthen the national market regulators. By strengthening, I mean increasing their independence and effectiveness, improving the quality of staff, etc. It would also appear to be legitimate to establish a European market regulator, which will monitor correct performance of functions assigned to national regulators and report directly to the European Commission on any irregularities found.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Daniel Caspary, on behalf of the PPE Group, Kader Arif, on behalf of the S&D Group, Niccolò Rinaldi, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Yannick Jadot, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Joe Higgins, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, and Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the ECR Group, on the Regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences - B7-0018/2010)
What is our starting position? We will need a new regulation from 1 January 2012 onwards because the old one will have expired. We need time for a proper procedure that gives us the opportunity to have two readings. On behalf of my group, I therefore expect the Commission to submit a new proposal as quickly as possible. As I said, we need sufficient time for a procedure with two readings and it would be unacceptable if we, as the European Parliament, were to have to take dubious decisions under pressure. We also need an evaluation of the existing system. I hope that we will very soon receive facts, figures and data that reveal how successful the existing system has been in practice. Has the existing system really facilitated trade for the States that benefit from it? Have the export figures also risen? Are the right countries benefiting from this system? I will throw this question out to everyone here: is everything in order with the existing system? For example, if countries like Qatar, whose per capita income is higher than that of 25 Member States of the European Union, are included in the GSP system, I am certain that we need to take a very critical look at this when reviewing the whole system.
In the first case, we witnessed a series of errors, some serious, being committed by Sri Lanka, a country which has the extenuating circumstance of having emerged from a very long civil war against a terrible terrorist organisation. The Commission, in my view, acted rather hastily in this case, and this quickly gave rise to the proposal to suspend the GSP+. However, Sri Lanka had no 'guardians', if we may call them such, in the Council, and so the decision was taken. As for the European Parliament, it had no role to play: nobody asked our opinion.
In the second case, we have a country that has to combat terrible internal guerrilla warfare and where there have been serious human rights violations, including the frequent killings of trade unionists. Up to now, the Commission has not expressed an opinion on the timeliness of opening an investigation and, in actual fact, it has continued on the path of the free trade agreement, which I personally am in agreement with. In the Council, we know that there are governments that are very active in protecting the interests of the Colombian authorities and, once again, the role of the European Parliament has been nonexistent: nobody has requested Parliament's opinion, despite the fact that it has to listen to the opinions of the others nearly every day.
In both cases, we have had no impact studies on the occupational and economic consequences of the possible suspension. However, among all the inconsistencies, there is one common element: the marginal role of the European Parliament. Yet these decisions are eminently political, not technical, and I find this unacceptable. We therefore need a new regulation, taking advantage of the end of 2011 expiry date, and I believe that these two concrete examples demonstrate this. In the meantime, however, it would also be beneficial to discuss what has been happening in recent months in these particular countries.
Commissioner, we are asking for the following: a new proposal, if possible by June; clear criteria regarding the eligibility of beneficiary countries, bearing in mind that the GSP is a development instrument and that we have some countries on the list that are frankly not really developing countries; the signing and application of the 27 International Labour Organisation conventions in the beneficiary countries; transparency of the rules on their conduct; a system by which to assess the impact of the GSP; and a communication to Parliament. As Mr Martin also mentioned, Parliament must have a full role in the event of suspension, since this is, I repeat, an eminently political decision.
And, Commissioner, what hope have the working people of Africa, Asia and Latin America when your Commission, only in recent weeks, cravenly bent the knee to the criminal speculation of free-booting hedge fund merchants seeking massive quick profits through outrageous speculation against the euro and Greece in particular? And you handed over the working class of Greece and the poor of Greece to the tender mercies of these parasites - criminals in fact. What hope have the poor and working people outside the borders of Europe in view of that situation?
As someone who has many friends and relatives in many of these poorer countries, I think we have to look no further than the governments of many of these countries: poor governance issues; state monopolies and corrupt governments that are preventing entrepreneurs in these countries from creating wealth; the fact that they find it difficult to import the materials that they need to add value and create wealth; also the fact that many citizens of the countries are denied access to goods and services that we take for granted here in the EU and in many richer countries.
Going forward, surely we should look to be more flexible in our application of GSP+, perhaps as an alternative to the EPAs. We can treat this in a number of ways. We can either impose sanctions on countries that do not meet standards or we can engage in ongoing dialogue to ensure that conditions in these countries are improved, and understand that Rome was not built in a day and neither were Europe's superior high standards. It is time to engage and to help entrepreneurs in developing countries rather than to over-politicise the issue.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the current GSP scheme expires on 31 December 2011. The Commission is already working on a substantive updating and review of the current scheme. Later this month, I will launch a wide public consultation on possible improvements and changes followed by a thorough impact reassessment. The Commission proposal for a successor regulation can therefore be expected to be ready during the first quarter of 2011. This proposal will, of course, be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, which may well last beyond the expiry date of the current scheme, 31 December 2011.
Thirdly, Parliament should also be drawn into the process of monitoring whether the GSP beneficiaries uphold - not only ratify but also effectively implement - the 27 ILO and United Nations conventions. The Commission should, at least, consult Parliament on this issue and it is, of course, our duty in Parliament to make sure that we develop mechanisms inside our relevant bodies, our committees, to contribute to such monitoring. On a final note, I would like to reiterate the call expressed in the draft resolution we will be voting on tomorrow. The Commission should draft the new regulation on GSP as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the new regulation should observe the following requirements, which are based on practice up to now. Firstly, keeping the provision of the generalised preferences scheme temporary so that it can be withdrawn when it is no longer necessary. Secondly, deepening and refining the methods of differentiating and selecting beneficiary countries, based on the level of development of each one and its external competitiveness. Thirdly, and finally, improving mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the conditions related to the generalised preferences scheme, especially with respect to the observance of human rights.
However, Commissioner, how does the Commission control the implementation of these criteria? Is the withdrawal of privileges carried out consistently when goods are exported that have been produced by forced or slave labour, when dishonest trade practices are discovered and when no control of the originating products is guaranteed? Moreover, should the improvement in human rights that is intended to be achieved through GSP+ not also ultimately include larger States? I am thinking of China, for example. All of our resolutions, the demonstrations and the bilateral negotiations between the EU and China have brought no improvement in the human rights situation. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people will take to the streets tomorrow, the International Tibet Memorial Day, and Tibetan flags will be hoisted in ten thousand cities and communities in the European Union. We will express solidarity with the people who are fighting for their cultural, linguistic and religious autonomy.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important opportunity to reaffirm, above all, the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences. Both the basic GSP system and the GSP+ system, which are both linked to the 'Everything But Arms' initiative, contribute to reducing poverty, in strict accordance with the primary obligation of ensuring respect for human rights. It is the violation of these basic principles of coexistence that recently led the European Union to withdraw Sri Lanka's preferential tariff benefits following a detailed investigation by the Commission.
The effectiveness of the regulation depends on its credibility, the objectiveness of the criteria upon which it is based and the strictness with which it is applied. In a Europe in which the vast majority of citizens do not agree with exporting democracy at gunpoint, trade and traderelated aid are essential vehicles for disseminating principles of coexistence based on respect for fundamental human rights. It is our duty not to lapse into indifference - which would be wrong - but also to avoid making hasty judgments about certain parties, judgments which sound like irrevocable sentences, as is the case with Colombia.
Of course, the Generalised System of Preferences is also a good way of putting pressure on countries to get them to abide by international agreements and conventions as well as commitments concerning human rights and so on. We must not forget, however, that the aim is development. Naturally, the EU must be able to refuse or remove this preferential treatment from countries that do not meet their commitments, but it is important to remember that we tread a fine line. A country that is denied greater freedom to trade and new export opportunities will not find it any easier to meet the commitments and the demands that we make of it.
(RO) I have a simple question for the Commissioner. According to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008, states which wish to obtain preferential terms as part of the GSP+ system have the opportunity to submit applications by the end of April this year. Given that the deadline is approaching, I would like to ask the Commissioner, if he has this information available, which states have applied so far and whether we should grant preferential terms to some new states when we are preparing to change the required criteria. I also add my support to my fellow Members who have emphasised that the European Parliament should be consulted on the application of the Generalised System of Preferences.
In the case of Colombia, the United Nations and ILO monitoring results show that there are question marks on the degree of effective implementation of certain UN and ILO Conventions, but it is also clear that Colombia has engaged with the ILO and the United Nations bodies and has made substantial changes to its legal system, and that steps are being taken by the government to amend its legislation and improve its implementation on the ground. There is an ongoing dialogue in cooperation with the United Nations and the ILO.
I would also like to recall the commitment I made to the Committee on International Trade at the time of my hearing and subsequently to provide a timetable for our legislative proposals that will be submitted to that committee in the coming months. As you will know, we are scheduled to meet tomorrow. We will try to work something out together that gives Parliament the maximum possibility to discuss in all openness the different dossiers, including the new GSP regulation and the roll-over system, which we should introduce as early as April.
There is no better way to honour the memory of those political prisoners and prisoners of conscience than to work actively to promote the expansion of freedom and democracy where it is deemed an unattainable luxury. The European Union's appeals have so far been met with no response. However, I am deeply concerned about the situation of political prisoners in Cuba and I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to take effective measures necessary for the release of political prisoners and to support and ensure their work as protectors of human rights. To the citizens of Cuba...
(PL) Mr President, I endorsed adoption of the motion for a resolution on Cuba. Frankly speaking, I do not understand why Fidel Castro's European friends are so doggedly defending the idea of a bankrupt and demoralised revolution. Does it have to be the case that only the fatal victims of what considers itself to be a progressive regime will make people aware of the need for change in Cuba? Sometimes individual sacrifices contribute to historic changes. I hope this will also be the case this time. At the same time, I would not like there to be more victims caused by the dogmatism of the authorities or their inability to analyse their own position and change.
Two things have kept the Communist regime in place in Cuba. First, the wrong-headed American blockade, which has allowed Castro and his regime to blame all the privations of their countrymen on foreign imperialism rather than on the economic mismanagement of Communism; and secondly the indulgence of some in Europe, including some in this House, who have a disgusting double standard whereby they excuse human rights abuses and the denial of democracy in Cuba on the grounds that it is good at producing doctors and ballerinas.
(PL) Mr President, in endorsing the motion for a resolution, I wanted to express support for investment in the development of low-emission technologies. The SET Plan can be effective and credible only if it is properly financed, and this includes finance from private sources. Arguments in favour of the necessity of such measures are, principally, the current economic situation in which Europe finds itself, dangerous climate changes and threats to energy security. Thanks to the latest research and technologies, an opportunity to overcome the crisis has arisen, which at the same time supports measures related to climate change. It is also an opportunity for European agriculture, a way to create new jobs in rural areas in the non-agricultural sector, especially in the area of creating sources of renewable energy.
(CS) I too have voted for the motion for a resolution on investment in the development of low-carbon technologies (the SET-Plan), because in my opinion it is a key instrument for transforming the Union into an innovatory economy, capable of fulfilling demanding objectives. In this regard I consider it essential that the Commission, in close cooperation with the European Investment Bank, submits an overall proposal on an instrument for investing in energy from renewable sources, energy-efficiency projects and the development of intelligent networks no later than 2011. Hand in hand with this there should be a strengthening of the role of the European Investment Bank in financing projects in the area of energy, and especially projects with higher levels of risk.
(PL) I could not support the resolution, although it is extremely important for the European economy. It should be noted that the resolution provides for a huge concentration of money only in certain areas, only in certain branches of the energy industry - the 'green' areas. This clashes with the notion of energy solidarity with countries which rely mainly on coal. Poland's energy needs are based on coal, so a smooth transition to a green economy is extremely important for us. As a result of such measures in Poland, instead of creating jobs we would have to close them. During a crisis this is extremely difficult, and would be harmful to Poland.
The resolution by the European Parliament, the pretext for which is the death of the Cuban prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who died following a hunger strike, despite the efforts of the Cuban health services to restore his health, is a provocative and unacceptable attack on the socialist government and people of Cuba and forms part of the anti-communist strategy being directed by the EU and led by the European Parliament in a bid to overturn the socialist regime. We condemn the hypocrisy and provocative effort on the part of the centre right, centre left and Green representatives of capital in the European Parliament to exploit this event.
The Greek Communist Party condemns and voted against the European Parliament resolution. It calls on the peoples to express their solidarity with the government and people of Cuba. To call for the common position against Cuba to be revoked. To condemn efforts by the EU to use human rights as a pretext for exerting imperialist pressure and coercion on the people of Cuba and its government. To demand that the criminal US embargo against Cuba be lifted immediately. To demand the immediate release of the 5 Cubans being held in US prisons. To defend socialist Cuba.
in writing. - I condemn unreservedly the ill-treatment of people in Cuba (or anywhere else). However, I abstained in the resolution, as a whole, against Cuba. One reason was that the resolution purported to give authority to the European Union and its functionaries to speak and act on behalf of Member States. The other reason was that many Member States of the European Union prosecute and imprison people for exercising non-violent freedom of expression, the holding of heretical opinions or taking part in dissenting activity. It is utterly hypocritical for parties that favour political repression in Europe to point the finger at states such as Cuba that share their repressive and anti-democratic opinions and activities.
in writing. - (PL) In the vote, today, I endorsed the resolution on the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba. As the European Parliament, we must unequivocally condemn the practices of the regime in Havana and speak up for the rights of independent journalists, peaceful dissidents and human rights defenders. In the resolution which has been adopted we have expressed profound solidarity with all Cubans and have endorsed their efforts at achieving democracy as well as respect for and protection of fundamental rights. I come from a country in which a popular movement arose in opposition to the Communist regime - the Solidarity movement. Although Poland and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, which today belong to the European Union, have now put their painful experiences of Communist regimes behind them, all the more we cannot forget those who are imprisoned and persecuted because they so much want democracy, liberty and freedom of speech.
I voted against Resolution on Cuba because I believe it constitutes an act of interference that violates international law. With my vote I have expressed my condemnation of this exercise in political manipulation whose only aim is to express disapproval of the Government of Cuba. The Members who voted in favour of this text are those who time and again refused to table a resolution in this Parliament condemning the coup that took place in Honduras. This resolution urges the European Union to show unreserved support for the change of political regime in the Republic of Cuba and also proposes the use of European cooperation mechanisms in order to achieve that aim, which constitutes an unacceptable act of interference that contravenes international law. For more than 50 years, the United States of America has maintained an economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba, in flagrant violation of international law and with severe repercussions for the economy and living conditions of Cubans. In spite of that, the Cuban Government has continued to guarantee its citizens universal access to healthcare and education.
in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Cuba, as it is important for the EU, too, to clearly express the idea that there is an urgent need for democratisation in the country, which is still under Communist rule. The incarceration of dissidents and political opponents is a typical feature of Communist States, but it is excessively practised in Cuba. The fact that the authorities are not even permitting the family of a prisoner who has died as a result of a hunger strike to organise a burial is a particular scandal.
in writing. - (SV) The USA has had a trade embargo against Cuba for 48 years. The embargo affects the Cuban population and is a constant and recurring excuse for the shortcomings of the Castro regime. Everything is said to be the fault of the American embargo and, as a result, the people of Cuba cannot lay the blame clearly at the door of the Communist regime and distance themselves from it. The democratic opposition in Cuba wants the embargo to be lifted. On 29 October 2009, 187 of the UN member states voted to lift the embargo. Three voted for it to remain in place and two abstained. None of the EU Member States voted in favour of keeping the embargo. In the past the European Parliament has condemned the embargo against Cuba and called for it to be ended immediately, in line with the demands made by the UN General Assembly on numerous occasions. (P5_TA(2003)0374) The European Parliament has also stated that the embargo defeats its own object. (P6_TA(2004)0061) The current resolution refers to the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba. During the debate before the vote, I tabled a proposal that Cuba should be presented with an ultimatum. The embargo will be lifted and within six months all prisoners of conscience must be released and reforms must be introduced. If the regime does not comply with these terms, the USA, the EU and Canada will bring in new and more intelligent sanctions which are aimed at the Cuban leadership, such as a ban on travelling to the country and a freeze on Cuban assets and on foreign investment.
It is vital to insist on a radical change in society based on the sustainability of cities, decentralised energy production and industrial competitiveness. This is an essential policy for a prosperous and sustainable society that is prepared for the challenges of climate change, secure energy supply and globalisation, with global leadership in the area of clean technologies. The SET Plan intends to contribute specifically to the development of clean technologies. I welcome the fundamental guidelines that the communication presents on how to organise the logic of intervention between the public and private sectors and between Community, national and regional financing. However, it is essential to increase public funding of scientific research in the area of clean technologies. Europe still has to create conditions for there to be more private investment in scientific research, in technological development and demonstration in the energy field. It is vital to move beyond words to action. The next EU financial perspective and the 8th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development should prioritise energy security, the fight against climate change and the environment. Only in this way will it be possible to maintain the competitiveness of our industry, promote economic growth and job creation.
I welcome the objectives of the SET Plan (Strategic Energy Technology Plan), which insist on the development of a low-carbon society. The SET Plan seeks to accelerate the development and roll-out of low-carbon technologies. This plan includes measures relating to planning, implementation, resources and international cooperation in the area of innovative technologies in the energy sector. Several studies estimate that promoting the European target of 20% renewable energy penetration will result in millions of new jobs by 2020. Furthermore, roughly two thirds of these jobs will be created in small and medium-sized enterprises. The solution requires the development of green technologies. Therefore, we need more funding for the SET Plan, which I advocate should be provided in the next review of the financial perspective. We also need to promote green technologies and skilled labour through investment in education and research. The sooner we begin to achieve a low-carbon society, the sooner we will emerge from the crisis.
in writing. - Mr President, Sustainable and effective low-carbon technologies are the core essentials in the huge task of decarbonisation we in the EU, and globally, are facing. It is due to this fact that I welcomed the rapid process in which Parliament drafted a resolution on the topic, giving a clear indication to the commission and the council that the SET Plan is timely and important. If we are serious with our mission, it is evident that we need all forms of low-carbon technologies, including sustainable nuclear power. Therefore I am happy that we managed to delete the wording on recital i, which is yet another attempt to put nuclear in a light it nowadays does not deserve. This recital may have had negative implications on the concept of 'sustainable low-carbon technologies' suggesting that nuclear is not part of that. The fact however is that we in the EU cannot afford not to use it if we want to take climate change seriously. Until renewable energies really can deliver effective results and secure constant energy flow, it is such low-carbon technologies which we must rely on.
in writing. - (DE) I abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution on 'Investing in Low-Carbon Technologies' as, although it contained a number of reasonable approaches, it supports the further development of nuclear energy, which is something that I reject due to the major risks associated with it. The motion for a resolution rightly points out that research has had too little funding hitherto. However, so that Europe remains competitive in respect of other global players, the funding of research projects must be massively expanded, especially in the field of the new energy sources. The development of new, low-carbon technologies in the energy sector will, I hope, not only safeguard the existing jobs in this field but will also create many additional highly qualified jobs. However, I believe that, in this respect, the investment should be made in the fields of solar energy and carbon capture and storage. Given the potential for grave consequences, the investments in nuclear energy must be re-thought and redeployed. This new policy direction in energy issues will also improve the security of energy supplies within the EU and institute a more robust independence from foreign suppliers.
in writing. - (ES) Like the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have voted against the motion for a resolution on investing in the development of low-carbon technologies (SET Plan) for a number of reasons; in particular, because the amendment requesting the deletion of recital I - which was key for us - was accepted; in that paragraph it was suggested that the sixth European Industrial Initiative on 'Sustainable Nuclear Energy' should be renamed simply 'Nuclear Energy'. We consider that the concept of 'sustainable nuclear energy' is meaningless because, in the best of cases, it is possible to reduce the threat to the environment and to people's health, and the risks of proliferation that stem from the development and use of nuclear energy, but not eliminate them.
in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the major natural disasters which have taken place in the autonomous region of Madeira and the effects of the storm Xynthia in Europe. I believe that the European Union must show solidarity to those who suffer as a result of these natural disasters. They have hit regions in Portugal, western France, various regions in Spain, in particular the Canary Islands and Andalusia, as well as Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. In western France the storm caused the death of roughly 60 people and the disappearance of a number of people, not to mention the destruction of several thousand homes. The European Commission can provide financial support to the affected regions through the European Union's Solidarity Fund. It is of paramount importance that there is a sense of solidarity between Member States in the event of major natural disasters. There must be coordination between the authorities at local, national and European level in their efforts to rebuild the affected areas. Effective prevention policies must not be overlooked either. We must ensure, both in this case and for the future, that European funds will reach the affected regions as quickly as possible in order to help those affected by natural disasters.
The storm that devastated Madeira on 20 February caused enormous human and material losses in the region of Madeira. The role of the EU is vitally important, as it has mechanisms and instruments at its disposal, such as the Solidarity Fund, the Structural Funds - the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund - and the Cohesion Fund, which need to be activated and applied in a quick, flexible and simplified manner. I welcome the motion for a resolution in which the European Commission is asked, as soon as it receives a request from the Portuguese Government, to initiate the action necessary to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in the most urgent and flexible way and to the greatest possible extent. I call on the solidarity of the institutions of the European Union towards the swift and flexible application of the Cohesion Fund, bearing in mind Madeira's special status as an insular and outermost region of the EU. I appeal to the good will of the European Commission as regards negotiating the revision of the regional operational programmes INTERVIR+ (ERDF) and RUMOS (ESF), as well as the section on Madeira of the Thematic Territorial Enhancement Operational Programme (Cohesion Fund).
in writing. - (PT) On 20 February this year there was a tragedy in Madeira, characterised by unprecedented, torrential rain, strong winds and huge waves. It left at least 42 dead, several disappeared, hundreds homeless and dozens wounded. I would like to highlight the immediate efforts of the Regional Government of Madeira and its institutions in their rapid and coordinated response to this tragedy. On 27-28 February 2010 in western France - in particular the regions of Poitou-Charentes and Pays -de -la Loire - there was a very strong and destructive storm, dubbed Xynthia. It left more than 60 dead, several disappeared and thousands homeless. In the face of these tragedies I wish to show my profound grief and strong solidarity with all the affected regions, giving my condolences to the families of the victims and paying tribute to the search and rescue teams. I call on the Commission to begin taking, as soon as requested by the respective Member State, all the necessary steps to mobilise as much of the European Union Solidarity Fund as is possible. When assessing these requests, the Commission must take into account the specific nature of the individual regions, in particular the fragility of isolated and peripheral regions.
I endorsed this motion for a resolution on the action to be taken in the wake of the devastating and deadly passage of storm Xynthia on our territory because, beyond trying to lay blame, we must above all show European solidarity so as to support the victims of this disaster, which struck several European countries. Not only must we harness the Solidarity Fund, but this aid must also come from the Cohesion Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. Lastly, we must encourage insurance companies to intervene as quickly as possible and subsequently learn lessons from such events when it comes to issuing planning permission.
in writing. - (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, I endorsed the motion for a resolution on the major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira and the effects of the storm 'Xynthia' in Europe. Let us concentrate on Madeira, because it was there that the catastrophe took the heaviest toll. We are creating a large and strong community for many reasons, but also so that we can help each other in times of need. Today, Madeira and other regions are in need, because they have been hit hard by the effects of the storm. It is our duty to help those who need our aid. I hope the motion for a resolution will contribute to the effective elimination of the effects of the tragedy. I sympathise deeply with all the victims and their families. Thank you.
In recent weeks, several EU regions have been hit by natural disasters: Madeira, then western France and various regions of Spain. The human and material consequences caused by the violence of these meteorological phenomena have left a deep impression on us MEPs. This explains the motion for a resolution on natural disasters voted on today in the European Parliament; it expresses our 'deepest sympathy' and 'solidarity' with the victims of the devastated regions. European solidarity must be reflected in financial terms by the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund and by means of other European-funded projects. However, when it comes to the Solidarity Fund, I must point out that the current regulation does not permit a sufficiently flexible and rapid response; the opportunity exists to amend this regulation, and it is now up to the European Council to make progress in this matter. I also voted in favour of the amendment supporting the proposal made by Mr Barnier in 2006 to create a European civil protection force. I regret that it has not been adopted; implementing this proposal would improve the EU's crisis response capacity.
in writing. - (DE) On 20 February, a serious natural disaster with torrential rainfall on an unprecedented scale, in conjunction with a powerful storm and very high waves, hit Madeira, killing at least 42 people, with many people still missing. In addition, hundreds of people have been left homeless. A few days later, the devastating storm Xynthia passed along the French Atlantic coast, causing nearly 60 deaths, in particular in the regions of Poitou-Charentes, Pays de la Loire and Brittany. There, too, there are many people missing.
The European Union, which has 27 Member States and half a billion citizens, must tackle not only the emergence of climate and environmental change, but must also look after its citizens and guarantee them the best possible conditions for survival after a crisis. Our efforts, however, must not concentrate only on giving help after the event. A fundamental reason for the European Union's existence is to give its citizens a sense of security. In relation to this, the appropriate EU institutions must take specific steps to supervise the regions and their abilities to undertake preventative action.
in writing. - I abstained on the resolution on the major natural disaster in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe because two of our key amendments were defeated. More specifically, the one which made reference to the fact that in France buildings were allowed on floodplains and natural wetlands and that housing speculation caused the construction of buildings in vulnerable areas, and the one stating that all Community funds for the implementation of such plans, particularly from the Structural Funds, the EAFRD, the Cohesion Fund and the European Solidarity Fund, be conditional on sustainability measures.
However, it also makes four important requests: it urges Mexico to ensure the right to a free press, because there have been attacks on journalists; to guarantee protection for the organisations that defend human rights, because those groups have been attacked and threatened; to guarantee protection for women who suffer violence, because many women have been murdered; and to avoid impunity and abuses of power by their police forces. This is what Parliament has asked of Mexico, in the spirit of friendship based on a favourable relationship with Mexico.
At the same time, it would appear that women are the judicial system's favourite victims. There is no other way to explain how it was possible for two indigenous women, Alberta Alcántara and Teresa González, to be sentenced to 21 years in prison and to have now spent more than three years in jail for kidnapping six men from the Federal Investigations Agency - all by themselves - during an incident in a market. Let us hope that the judge, who will make a decision on the women's appeal in one week's time, realises how ridiculous and unjust the situation is.
author. - (PL) For several years now, the authorities in Mexico, including, first and foremost, President Felipe Calderón, have been waging a bloody war against drugs gangs. Over 40 000 soldiers have been involved in the war, and several successes have been achieved. These successes include, undoubtedly, the arrests of the bosses of the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels, the destruction of over 23 000 hectares of opium crops and 38 000 hectares of marihuana, the closures of over 50 illegal laboratories which were producing narcotics and the arrests of over 45 000 people who were involved with this process.
We need to be aware that the Mexican drugs cartels generate annual incomes of many billions of dollars, which is incomparably more than the amounts allocated by the Mexican Government to tackling the narcotics problem. So the gangs are spending huge sums on corrupting politicians, judges and police officers. This is precisely why the authorities are losing the war. Since 2006, almost 15 000 people have been killed, and over 6 000 of them have been killed since last October. Journalists are especially in danger, as over 60 have been killed, including, recently, Jorge Ochoa Martínez.
author. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mexico has a major problem with drugs trafficking and drug-related violence. To address this situation, the Government of President Felipe Calderón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication: he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces, a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested, the destruction of drugs and the confiscation of weapons. The army has accepted all the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, including those concerning the investigation of complaints about their own conduct.
Since then, the violent acts committed by these military forces and by the police forces alike have increased with complete impunity. The NGOs are producing ever more reports and talking about crimes of state. Journalists, indigenous communities, and especially women, both indigenous and nonindigenous, are particularly affected. I met some of these women from San Salvador Atenco; they had been raped and tortured by the police forces. I was appalled at what they told me. The perpetrators of these acts committed in May 2006 still enjoy complete impunity.
Mr President, the images of the brutal use of violence on the open street in the so-called war on drugs in Mexico reach us regularly via the mass media. The murder of hundreds of women, mostly workers in the north of the country, is making headlines and has spawned the term 'feminicide'. The European Parliament has produced its own report on this. Despite knowledge of the major increase in serious violations of human rights, the Mexican Government appears to be unable or unwilling to do anything about it. Pointing out the necessary relentlessness in the fight against drug dealers is no substitute for consistent government action. The major expansion of military presence and power, the competence of military courts for crimes committed by soldiers, the almost complete impunity - these are the real causes of the escalating violence in the country. Even the Mexican national human rights commission has repeatedly documented the increase in violent crime by the military.
The government itself does not want to admit the situation. It also continually hushes up crime. Yesterday, for example, there was a story going around in the media that the Ministry of Defence had paid out an awful lot of money to the families of victims of violence in order to buy their silence. Who were the perpetrators? They were soldiers. The EU must address the fight against impunity in all its relations with Mexico. Given the severity of the human rights violations, it is absolutely necessary for the EU not to update the Global Agreement with Mexico. It must not do so until there has been a substantial improvement in the human rights situation in that country.
Mr President, in this Chamber a moment ago, I heard a call not to sign the understanding with the Mexican authorities. I do not understand this suggestion. After all, we commend the President of Mexico - and those who spoke before me a moment ago also did so - for his determined fight against the drugs barons and the mafia. We should, therefore, commend the Mexican authorities for their action, while at the same time, of course, pointing out that they should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, and that in this fight they should still try to respect human rights. That is obvious. We have to understand the situation of a country which has been struggling with huge organised crime syndicates and the mafia for decades. If the president of the country declares war in this area, he should be given complete support. However, of course, we have been speaking, here, about journalists, and we have been speaking about other victims. It should be emphasised that these people should not be made the victims of discrimination.
Firstly, as we have heard, violence has been on the increase this year. Mexico is in the grip of large drug cartels and the violence they perpetrate is estimated to have cost 15 000 lives already. The situation is especially bad close to the border between Mexico and the United States of America. The Mexican Government is trying to bring the situation under control by means of a massive military and police operation. The strategy has also attracted a lot of criticism. Obviously, responsibility for the drug trade, money laundering and the problems these cause also extends to other countries, and Mexico needs to be offered assistance and cooperation.
