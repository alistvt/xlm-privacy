WASHINGTON, DC – The solution to the crisis in Ukraine lies in part in Syria.
It is time for US President Barack Obama to demonstrate that he can order the offensive use of force in circumstances other than secret drone attacks or covert operations.
The result will change the strategic calculus not only in Damascus, but also in Moscow, not to mention Beijing and Tokyo.
Many argue that Obama’s climb-down from his threatened missile strikes against Syria last August emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to annex Crimea.
But it is more likely that Putin acted for domestic reasons – to distract Russians’ attention from their country’s failing economy and to salve the humiliation of watching pro-European demonstrators oust the Ukrainian government he backed.
Regardless of Putin’s initial motivations, he is now operating in an environment in which he is quite certain of the parameters of play.
He is weighing the value of further dismemberment of Ukraine, with some pieces either joining Russia or becoming Russian vassal states, against the pain of much stronger and more comprehensive economic sanctions.
Western use of force, other than to send arms to a fairly hapless Ukrainian army, is not part of the equation.
In the case of Syria, the US, the world’s largest and most flexible military power, has chosen to negotiate with its hands tied behind its back for more than three years.
This is no less of a mistake in the case of Russia, with a leader like Putin who measures himself and his fellow leaders in terms of crude machismo.
It is time to change Putin’s calculations, and Syria is the place to do it.
Through a combination of mortars that shatter entire city quarters, starvation, hypothermia, and now barrel bombs that spray nails and shrapnel indiscriminately, President Bashar al-Assad’s forces have seized the advantage.
“Realist” foreign policy analysts openly describe Assad as the lesser evil compared to the Al Qaeda-affiliated members of the opposition; others see an advantage in letting all sides fight it out, tying one another down for years.
Moreover, the Syrian government does appear to be slowly giving up its chemical weapons, as it agreed last September to do.
The problem is that if Assad continues to believe that he can do anything to his people except kill them with chemicals, he will exterminate his opponents, slaughtering everyone he captures and punishing entire communities, just as his father, Hafez al-Assad, massacred the residents of Hama in 1982.
Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, Assad has fanned fears of what Sunni opposition forces might do to the Alawites, Druze, Christians and other minorities if they won.
It would either force the regime back to the negotiating table with a genuine intention of reaching a settlement, or at least make it clear that Assad will not have a free hand in re-establishing his rule.
It is impossible to strike Syria legally so long as Russia sits on the United Nations Security Council, given its ability to veto any resolution authorizing the use of force.
But even Russia agreed in February to Resolution 2139, designed to compel the Syrian government to increase flows of humanitarian aid to starving and wounded civilians.
Among other things, Resolution 2139 requires that “all parties immediately cease all attacks against civilians, as well as the indiscriminate employment of weapons in populated areas, including shelling and aerial bombardment, such as the use of barrel bombs….”
The US, together with as many countries as will cooperate, could use force to eliminate Syria’s fixed-wing aircraft as a first step toward enforcing Resolution 2139.
“Aerial bombardment” would still likely continue via helicopter, but such a strike would announce immediately that the game has changed.
After the strike, the US, France, and Britain should ask for the Security Council’s approval of the action taken, as they did after NATO’s intervention in Kosovo in 1999.
Equally important, shots fired by the US in Syria will echo loudly in Russia.
The great irony is that Putin is now seeking to do in Ukraine exactly what Assad has done so successfully: portray a legitimate political opposition as a gang of thugs and terrorists, while relying on provocations and lies to turn non-violent protest into violent attacks that then justify an armed response.
Recall that the Syrian opposition marched peacefully under fire for six months before the first units of the Free Syrian Army tentatively began to form.
In Ukraine, Putin would be happy to turn a peaceful opposition’s ouster of a corrupt government into a civil war.
Putin may believe, as Western powers have repeatedly told their own citizens, that NATO forces will never risk the possibility of nuclear war by deploying in Ukraine.
Putting force on the table in resolving the Ukraine crisis, even force used in Syria, is particularly important because economic pressure on Russia, as critical as it is in the Western portfolio of responses, can create a perverse incentive for Putin.
As the Russian ruble falls and foreign investment dries up, the Russian population will become restive, giving him even more reason to distract them with patriotic spectacles welcoming still more “Russians” back to the motherland.
But if the US meets bullets with words, tyrants will draw their own conclusions.
Japan, for example, is now wondering how the US will respond should China manufacture a crisis over the disputed Senkaku Islands.
To lead effectively, in both the national and the global interest, the US must demonstrate its readiness to shoulder the full responsibilities of power.
Striking Syria might not end the civil war there, but it could prevent the eruption of a new one in Ukraine.
LONDON – The budget-cutting austerity program of Britain’s new coalition government has been claiming all the headlines, but David Cameron’s cabinet is breaking with its Labour predecessor in another key area as well: human rights.
Indeed, the human-rights experiment that Tony Blair’s Labour government brought to Britain has failed.
Faulted by some for its inability to prevent “illiberal” anti-terrorism measures, the Human Rights Act is criticized by just as many others for hampering counter-terrorism policy.
Indeed, many people mock the very notion of human rights, which is seen as leading to “loony” concessions that favor criminals and terrorists.
Overall, the reaction of both press and public is one of disillusion and/or cynicism.
Britain famously has no written constitution, or, until recently, anything resembling a modern Bill of Rights.
The concept of universal human rights is literally foreign – enshrined in the broad-brush principles of the European Convention on Human Rights, whose court sits in Strasbourg.
Until recently, anyone who wished to bring a human-rights case against the British government had to go to France.
With fanfare and idealism – reflected in the slogan “Rights Brought Home” – the Human Rights Act came into effect in 2000.
But the high-minded liberalism of the then-elite had a practical point as well: should the government have any soiled linen, it should be laundered in British courts rather than be aired before a panel of international judges.
Yet the Act is unloved by the British public, which never engaged with the process.
As Tony Blair’s wife, Cherie Booth, herself a human rights lawyer, lamented, “the majority of people feel that human rights are not relevant to their lives.”
There is a lesson here: if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.
When compared with human-rights abuses that truly affect humanity, the complaints dealt with by the British courts are small beer.
Which child goes to what school or what public housing is offered to which asylum seeker will be of concern to many people (and views will differ).
But using the broad brush of “human rights” to resolve such issues trivializes the concept.
After all, what responsible public body wants to be accused of violating human rights?
Indeed, the threat of human-rights litigation has made providers of public services overly cautious and defensive.
This has led the popular press to howl that we now live in a costly, bureaucratic, and inefficient “human rights culture” – a charge with profound political resonance.
Before he became Prime Minister, Cameron called for the Human Rights Act to be replaced with something more “British.”
Paradoxically, some deem human rights to be wholly inefficacious where their recognition is most required.
Many MPs who backed the incorporation of the European human-rights convention into British law came to view formal recognition of human rights as a grave inconvenience when faced with Al Qaeda-inspired terrorism.
In short, having brought rights home, the Blair government ended up trying to hide them under the sofa.
This conundrum is symbolized by the debate over detaining terrorism suspects without charge or trial.
Initially, Blair attempted to force through detention without charge for up to 90 days.
Parliament settled on 28 days – still the longest such period in the Western world.
So much, then, for Article 6 of the European Convention, which provides that everyone charged with a criminal offense has the right “to be informed promptly” of the nature of the accusation against him.
So much, also, for Magna Carta, which provides that “No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned…but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.”
The fact is that any piece of legislation purporting to embody human rights is entirely vulnerable to a political system in which parliament is supreme.
Rights brought home one day; detention for a month without charge the next.
Indeed, even when the cause of human rights is being advanced, the Human Rights Act is now overlooked.
In May, in his first major policy speech, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the sweeping away of the “Big Brother” state that Blair had constructed: no more ID cards or national identity register, new restrictions on the storage of DNA, tighter regulation of the closed-circuit television surveillance that had made the British the most monitored people on earth, and so on.
All this and not one mention of “human rights” – an absence that reflects the political sensitivity of human rights in Britain today, and that tacitly acknowledges that when the stakes are high, the Human Rights Act cannot be relied upon.
Where, then, does that leave the Cameron government’s supposed extirpation of Big Brother?
One way forward would be to go further than Blair by ring-fencing certain principles and creating some form of constitutional court to defend them.
But the cost of such rigid rules may be high, and their effectiveness, as witnessed by the vagaries of the United States’ record on human rights, is less fool-proof than is sometimes imagined.
So, perhaps in a mature democracy, human rights should be dignified by actions rather than words.
Instead of introducing more legislation that is tainted both in the popular imagination and in its utility, Britain could, after all, trust its constitution to act as and when required to safeguard liberty and fair play.
For good or ill, democratic sentiment will win out, and Britain’s human-rights record, while imperfect, remains strong.
BERLIN – While Europe remains preoccupied with its own slow-motion crisis, and other global powers continue to be mesmerized by the bizarre spectacle of European officials’ myriad efforts to rescue the euro (and thus the global financial system), clouds of war are massing over Iran once more.
For years, Iran has been pursuing both a nuclear program and the development of long-range missiles, which points to only one conclusion: the country’s leaders are intent on building nuclear weapons, or at least on reaching the technological threshold beyond which only a single political decision is required to achieve that end.
The latter course would arguably keep Iran within the scope of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to which it is a signatory.
Otherwise, Iran’s nuclear and missile programs would be a pointless waste of money.
The country has only one civilian nuclear reactor, with fuel rods supplied by Russia, and the Iranian technology now being developed cannot be used in it.
But uranium enrichment makes a lot of sense if you want a nuclear weapon; indeed, for that purpose, enrichment is indispensable.
Moreover, Iran is building a heavy-water reactor, supposedly for research purposes, but which is also needed to build a plutonium bomb.
Iran has, in violation of the NPT, hidden substantial parts of this program.
The country has also spent millions of dollars on illegal purchases of enrichment technology and nuclear-weapon designs from the Pakistani nuclear scientist and black marketeer A.Q. Khan, the “Father of the Pakistani bomb.”
Iran tried to conceal these transactions for years, until its cover was blown when Libya began to cooperate with the West and exposed the Khan network.
An Iran armed with nuclear weapons (or one political decision away from possessing them) would drastically alter the Middle East’s strategic balance.
At best, a nuclear-arms race would threaten to consume this already-unstable region, which would endanger the NPT, with far-reaching global consequences.
At worst, nuclear weapons would serve Iran’s “revolutionary” foreign policy in the region, which the country’s leaders have pursued since the birth of the Islamic Republic in 1979.
The combination of an anti-status quo foreign policy and nuclear weapons and missiles is a nightmare not only for Israel, which at least has second-strike capabilities, but also for Iran’s non-nuclear Arab neighbors and Turkey.
Indeed, the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, feel more existentially threatened by Iran than Israel does.
Europe’s security profile, too, would change dramatically if Iran were to possess nuclear warheads and long-range missiles.
All attempts at negotiations have led nowhere, with Iran continuing to enrich uranium and improve its nuclear technology.
Sanctions, while useful, work only in the very long term, and a change in the balance of power within the country is not foreseeable in the short term.
So it is only a matter of time – and not much time – until Iran’s neighbors and the international community will confront a fateful choice: either accept Iran as a nuclear power, or decide that the mere prospect, as it becomes more realistic, is leading to war.
President Barack Obama has already made clear that the United States will not accept Iran as a nuclear power under any circumstances.
The same is true of Israel and Iran’s Arab neighbors in the Gulf.
The Israeli government recently suggested that Iran would reach the nuclear threshold within nine months, and Iran could become a major issue in the long run-up to the US presidential election in November 2012.
And it is difficult to imagine that Israel’s current government will stand by idly while Iran becomes a nuclear power (or a nuclear quasi-power).
On the other hand, talk of military intervention – which, under the circumstances, would largely boil down to air strikes – is cheap.
There are grave doubts about whether the Iranian nuclear program could be eliminated from the air.
In fact, with large parts of the world most likely condemning any attack, military intervention could clear the diplomatic path to an Iranian bomb.
It is better not to dwell on what the Middle East might look like after this kind of confrontation.
Iranian opposition forces would likely be the first victim of Western military action, and, elsewhere in the region, the Arab Spring would likely be submerged under a massive anti-Western wave of solidarity with Iran.
The region would be pushed back into violence and terror, instead of continuing its transformation from the bottom up.
The effects on the global economy would be no less significant, to say nothing of the humanitarian consequences.
A last-ditch diplomatic solution appears unlikely, given that the nuclear question plays a decisive role in the Iranian regime’s factional struggles, in which anyone favoring compromise can be considered the loser.
Moreover, Iran’s leaders seem to assume that the country is too big and too strong to be subdued by sanctions or air strikes.
Historically, the road to disaster has usually been paved with good intentions and grave errors of judgment.
That could happen again in 2012, when miscalculations on all sides could clear the path to war or a nuclear Iran – or, quite realistically, to both.
Further escalation in the Middle East will culminate in these wretched alternatives sooner rather than later, unless a diplomatic solution is found (or unless diplomacy can at least buy time).
In the absence of any viable route to US diplomatic engagement with Iran, the burden of organizing, convening, and conducting such highly sensitive negotiations falls on Europe.
And European leaders, as Iran knows very well, have other things on their minds.
CAMBRIDGE – The Standard and Poor’s 500 index of share prices has fluctuated wildly during 2018 but has returned to nearly the same level that it was at the beginning of the year.
The absence of a net fall for the year reflects the combination of a rise in corporate profits and a 12% decline in the price-earnings ratio.
And the fall in the price-earnings ratio is an indication of the likely evolution of share prices in the next few years.
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio is now 40% higher than its historic average.
Its rise reflects the very low interest rates that have prevailed since the US Federal Reserve cut the federal funds interest rate to near zero in 2008.
As long-term interest rates rise, however, share prices will be less attractive to investors and will decline.
A key sign of this is that the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds has doubled in the past two years.
But, at a little over 3%, it is still barely above the rate of inflation, which averaged 2.9% over the past 12 months.
First, the Fed is raising the short-term federal funds rate and projects that it will increase from a little over 2% to about 3.5% by the end of 2020.
Second, the very large projected budget deficits will cause long-term rates to rise in order to induce investors to absorb the increased volume of government debt.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the volume of publicly held debt will rise from about $15 trillion now to nearly $30 trillion by the end of the decade.
Third, the very low and falling rate of unemployment will cause inflation to accelerate.
Investors will demand higher yields on bonds to compensate for the resulting loss of purchasing power.
It would not be surprising if the rate on ten-year Treasury bonds rises to 5% or more over the next few years.
With an inflation rate of 3%, the real yield will be back to a normal historic level of over 2%.
This normalization of the ten-year interest rate could cause the P/E ratio to return to its historical benchmark.
A decline of that magnitude, from its current level of 40% above the historic average, would cause household wealth to shrink by about $8 trillion.
The historic relationship between household wealth and consumer spending implies that the annual level of household consumption would decline by about 1.5% of GDP.
That fall in household demand, and the induced decline in business investment, would push the US economy into recession.
Most recessions in the United States have been relatively short and shallow, with durations of less than a year between the beginning of the downturn and the date when the recovery begins.
The recession that began in 2007 was much longer and deeper because of the collapse of financial institutions.
The faster and more robust recoveries that characterized most previous recessions reflected aggressive countercyclical monetary policy by the Fed, which cut the short-term interest rate very sharply.
But if a recession begins as soon as 2020, the Fed will not be in a position to reduce the federal funds rate significantly.
Indeed, the Fed now projects the federal funds rate at the end of 2020 to be less than 3.5%.
In that case, monetary policy would be unable to combat an economic downturn.
The alternative is to rely on fiscal stimulus, achieved by cutting taxes or increasing spending.
But with annual budget deficits of $1 trillion and government debt heading toward 100% of GDP, a stimulus package would be politically difficult to enact.
As a result, the next economic downturn is likely to be deeper and longer than would otherwise be the case.
If the government at that time chooses to use fiscal policy, the future debt-to-GDP ratio will rise further above 100% of GDP, forcing long-term interest rates even higher.
Perhaps it takes an ex-KGB spy for a Kremlin ruler to play diplomatic poker with skill.
Indeed, President Vladimir Putin shows as much mastery at international diplomacy as he does in handling Russian domestic affairs.
Not since Gustav Stresemann, Weimar Germany's foreign minister, played the Soviet Union and the West off against each other, has a leader with so weak a hand played his cards so effectively.
Putin's latest moves in North Korea, and his careful tap-dance over Iraq, are just the latest examples.
Diplomacy, in its traditional form, was never Russia's strong suit.
Even when part of alliances--the Triple Alliance with Bismarck's Germany and the Habsburg Empire, or the Entente with France before the First World War--Russia was kept at a distance.
Russian leaders typically dealt with their fear of isolation--and encirclement--by going out of their way to appear threatening.
In the Soviet era, the distances between Russia and its neighbors became unbridgeable chasms, with the USSR ringed either by hostile states or weak, servile ones.
Stalin wasted no time in antagonizing Communist China after Mao's revolution of 1949.
Not until Boris Yeltsin did Russia make its first steps to bridge these divides.
But Yeltsin could never get over Russia's lost superpower status; his periodic growls to assert Russia's wounded pride ultimately made him seem unreliable.
In Yugoslavia, former Premier Victor Chernomyrdin joined Finnish President Matti Ahtissari in resolving the Kosovo crisis of 1999.
But this hardly amounted to recognition of Russia's indispensability; after all, NATO troops entered Kosovo without Russian consent.
But this recognition is not a confession of weakness; instead, it reflects his clear-sighted analysis of Russia's current predicament, and of the country's need to create, recreate, and sustain friendly relations among all of its neighbors if lost influence is to be regained.
Since Putin took the reigns of power in 2000 he has become almost everybody's best friend--Belarus's lunatic strongman Aleksander Lukashenko, US President George W. Bush, Germany's Gerhard Schroeder, Japan's Junichiro Koizumi, and China's Jiang Zemin.
Even North Korea's erratic leader, the hermit Kim Jong Il, who never travels outside his country, has visited Putin twice in recent years.
In the summer of 2002, the North Korean leader visited Russia to learn about "non-intrusive"--that is, not entirely Western--capitalism, while riding in an armored train on the Trans-Siberian railway.
Kim seemed to reason that, while Russia was no longer Soviet, it retained enough socialist overtones to work with his country.
The benefit of this "educational experiment" was that Putin became one of the few people to whom Kim Jong Il listens.
Even as he hosted Kim in Moscow, Russian diplomats in Pyongyang were helping to protect an American spy in North Korea.
Previously spurned by America in its attempts to use its longstanding contacts in Asia, this assistance appears to have convinced America that Russia can be of real help in its diplomacy with North Korea.
Final negotiations over North Korea's nuclear ambitions will undoubtedly need to take place between the US and Kim Jong Il.
What Putin may be able to provide is the diplomatic cover the US president needs to maintain his pose of not negotiating directly with the North Koreans.
This will allow President Bush to avoid seeming to surrender to the threat of nuclear blackmail.
As a diplomatic practitioner, Putin has learned history's lessons and is determined not to see his country ringed by enmity.
Instead of Russia's borders draining his country's economy, he envisions Russia as a transit point between east and west, and also as an engine of growth for countries in search of the heavy industrial equipment Russia makes.
A rail link between South Korea and Siberia, to carry Korean and Japanese goods west and Russian resource exports east, may be but one positive result of any successful deal he may broker on the Korean peninsula.
Of course, some of the old suspicions about Russian motives linger in the West, most particularly over Iraq (where Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil company, recently signed a new deal to develop Iraqi oil fields).
But Putin's interventions in the UN Security Council over Iraq have been far more moderate than, say, those of France and Germany, two of America's historic allies.
This is so even though Russia has vital national interests to protect in Iraq, including real fears about regional instability spreading into Russia's south, with its millions of Muslim citizens.
For too long Russia practiced either the diplomacy of the thug or that of the Byzantine.
The first made potential partners recoil in fear, the second made them shrink in confusion.
But a spy's stock-in-trade is recruiting and nurturing collaborators.
Those skills are now being put on display by Russia's spymaster president.
NAIROBI – Kenya’s fiercely contested presidential election in March, and its disputed outcome, has left the victor, Uhuru Kenyatta, with a daunting challenge: to unite a country riven with ethnic violence and distrust.
Although this election was accompanied by far less violence than the previous presidential vote in 2007, the opposition candidate Raila Odinga’s second consecutive defeat has only re-enforced his supporters’ fears that they are once again being cheated out of power.
Kenyatta, a member of the dominant Kikuyu ethnic group, says that he wants to heal the country’s divisions, echoing the promise of his predecessor, Mwai Kibaki.
There is a simple way to start: combat the corruption and nepotism that characterize so much state employment.
Kenyatta assumes power a half-century after his father, Jomo Kenyatta, led Kenya to independence.
The anniversary provides a reason to reflect on some of the country’s achievements and failings, especially in the field of education – the key to economic opportunity and professionalization of the public sector.
The post-independence government thus found itself having to hire vast numbers of teachers, many of them unqualified, to cope with the influx of black students attending school for the first time.
In fact, many of them can now only find work in neighboring countries such as South Sudan, which needs to fill shortages left by decades of conflict.
Investment in Kenya’s education system, along with economic reforms, and (until recently) relative political stability has undoubtedly helped the economy, which has grown by around 4-5% annually over the past decade, following long periods of stagnation.
By some definitions, around one-quarter of the country’s 44 million people are in the middle class.
Compared with the rest of the region, the country’s key sectors – including education, transport, communications, agriculture, and tourism – are professionally managed and the envy of much of East Africa.
But the emergence of an increasingly educated population has also intensified the need for more skilled jobs.
The government has promised to create jobs, but that is only part of the battle; it must also reform the way such jobs are filled.
Kenyans typically complain that key positions are not advertised nationally (as required by law) until the employer has already found the “ideal” candidate.
Instead, vacancies are listed internally as temporary contracts, obviating the need for a national search.
This makes it easy for a manager to hire a relative or friend, usually from a favored ethnic group.
The candidate is then best placed to benefit when the temporary post is upgraded and advertised as a permanent position.
There are even instances in which two managers will contrive to hire each other’s relatives to evade nepotism charges.
The system is hardest on first-generation graduates who lack a highly placed relative to help them into the workforce; they are often left with no option but to pay a hefty bribe to advance their careers.
Unsurprisingly, the way state jobs are filled, from the presidency down, has become a source of deep and widespread bitterness.
The Kenyatta government could go a long way toward addressing the problem with one very practical measure: establishing and supporting an independent watchdog to audit hiring and promotion decisions in official agencies.
The vetting process that Kenyans observed being applied to recent cabinet appointments should be extended throughout the public sector (and also to private entities that win state contracts).
An independent watchdog would require all employers to demonstrate that their hiring practices are transparent, competitive, and meritocratic.
Its very existence, and the threat of random investigations, would serve as an effective deterrent against malpractice – just as random audits deter tax evaders.
Whistleblowers, encouraged to come forward by legal protections enshrined in the agency’s founding legislation, would provide leads for the investigators.
Kenyatta has a chance to steer Kenya away from the ethnic tensions that have plagued its society and economy.
By introducing and implementing fairness and transparency to public-sector recruitment, and ensuring that appointments are based on talent, not ethnic or family connections, Kenyans may become less fearful about their political leaders’ origins.
They may also grow more confident that their skills will be properly deployed in a fast-growing economy, further spreading the prosperity that many fellow citizens have only recently started to enjoy.
MADRID – When Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France last year, he was presented as a kind of European savior, a wunderkind who had burst onto the French political scene just in the nick of time.
Now, many are asking, with a combination of schadenfreude and defeatism, whether Macron’s star burned too bright – and is thus destined to burn out fast.
But this focus on Macron’s record so far threatens to overshadow his crucial message about the future of European democracy.
Macron won the French presidency not by appropriating veiled nationalist-populist messages, as Mark Rutte did to hold on to power in the Netherlands, but by championing a positive and robust pro-European platform.
With his ambitious calls for European unity and dogged support of liberal democracy, Macron inspired hope that the wave of anti-European populism had crested, and that real progress was on the horizon.
Germany’s federal election last September delivered a weak mandate for Chancellor Angela Merkel, and established the far-right Alternative für Deutschland as a real political force.
This was followed in February by the ignominious resignation of European cheerleader Martin Schulz as leader of the Social Democrats.
In Italy’s general election in March, the populist Five Star Movement and the far-right League party together won more than 50% of the vote.
And, in Hungary earlier this month, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the poster child of illiberal democracy, secured a third term – and the chance to reshape the constitution – with a large majority.
Clearly, Macron’s victory did not mark the beginning of a new era of European politics so much as the beginning of yet another chapter in the ongoing struggle for the future of Europe.
Macron delivered this very message earlier this month while addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg , where he declared that “European democracy is our best chance,” and called for a “new European sovereignty” that would protect and provide for the European Union’s citizens.
He also addressed directly the issue of complacency: “I don’t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past.
I want to belong to a generation that has decided forcefully to defend its democracy.”
Macron’s rousing call to arms is the latest development in a diplomatic offensice that included hobnobbing with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and frank discussions about EU-Turkey relations with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
That effort is now continuing, with the jupiterian Macron meeting the mercurial Donald Trump in Washington, DC, this week.
Earlier this month, both leaders – along with British Prime Minister Theresa May – ordered strikes on Syrian military installations, following a chemical-weapons attack on rebel-held territory allegedly carried out by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.
Some argue that Macron’s soaring pro-European rhetoric and outsize international personality amount to a ploy to boost his popularity within France.
After all, his attempts to reform the French economy, public sector, and labor markets – not to mention his perceived elitist pretensions and imperialist tendencies – have produced a swift and severe backlash.
Virtually all politicians try to leverage their international status to boost their standing at home.
Yet even Macron’s supporters fail adequately to defend that message, instead getting caught up in the practical challenges ahead.
This is the “yes, but” crowd: “Yes he is right about Europe,” they say, “but he has to reform the French economy first,” or “he can’t succeed without more German support.”
To be an engine of change in Europe, France must undergo a deep structural transformation, which, as student protests at Sciences Po and railway strikes across France show, will be very difficult.
And to reform the EU, Macron will need German backing, which may not be in the offing, given the apparent turn by Merkel’s coalition away from deeper European integration.
The danger is here is that by tying the message too tightly to Macron and his achievements, we may devalue the underlying ideas.
France might not get its act together, and Merkel might not leap to reform Europe’s monetary union.
In his Strasbourg speech, Macron set out a potent agenda: the EU must convince its citizens that it deserves their support, by engaging with them directly and offering a compelling narrative that emphasizes the Union’s unwavering commitment to liberal democracy.
Rather than poke holes in Macron’s methods or circumstances, Europeans should view his message as a challenge.
Everyone who believes in the EU must step up to strengthen it, not just by offering ideas, but also by fighting for their realization.
Macron might be a talented soloist, but what Europe needs now is a chorus.
He’d been itching to throw himself into the 2016 presidential race and do what he could to ensure that Donald Trump wouldn’t succeed him as President of the United States.
It was evident throughout the campaign that he backed his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, but he had to wait to declare his support openly until it was certain that Senator Bernie Sanders couldn’t beat her at the convention.
His entry into the campaign came at a time when 56% of Americans approve of his performance – the highest level in a long time.
In 2014, his approval rating dipped to a low of 40%, owing to public discontent with the economy and the Islamic State’s gains in Iraq and Syria.
Democrats running for re-election that year deliberately avoided joint appearances with him; now, they clamor for his attendance at their campaign events.
The first scheduled campaign appearance of Obama and Clinton together was postponed because of the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.
It was rescheduled for July 5, the day, it turned out, that James Comey, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, unexpectedly held a morning press conference on the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s handling of State Department emails on her personal server.
While Clinton had been “extremely careless” in handling classified material, Comey said, there wasn’t enough evidence of criminal intent to indict her.
Though it takes days to set up a presidential appearance, conspiracy theorists – and Donald Trump, perhaps the “conspiracy theorist in chief” – had a field day.
Obama, they concluded, was part of an elaborate plot – of which there is no convincing evidence – to let Clinton off the hook legally, and that the campaign appearance was orchestrated to distract people’s attention from Comey’s harsh comments.
Campaigning with Clinton in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama appeared to be a very happy man, loose and funny.
(That burden is apparent in how Obama’s hair has turned almost entirely gray since 2008.)
And now, as he prepares to leave office, his approval rating stands as a powerful rebuke to the Republicans, who have tried to block him at every turn for the last eight years.
Then, a week later, Obama had to make his 11th trip as president to a US city – this time Dallas – to comfort a community shaken by gun violence and the country’s racial divide.
The murder of five policemen there occurred during a demonstration – one of many held across the country – to protest the recent deaths of two black men shot to death by police after they were detained for minor infractions.
Police violence against African Americans has been commonplace; but widespread use of smartphones, with their ability to record high-quality video, has suddenly made such episodes a frequent feature of the news cycle.
As it happens, Dallas has a model police force, reformed after being one of the most out-of-control in the country, and the murders of the policemen, carried out by a lone former serviceman with apparent mental problems, took place as officers mingled easily with the demonstrators.
Obama has had to struggle with America’s racial divisions, and the killing of innocent African Americans, almost since the beginning of his presidency.
He’s understood since his youth that he couldn’t come across as an “angry black,” even to his white mother.
Indeed, following the arrest in 2009 of Henry Louis Gates Jr., a well-known Harvard professor, as he was trying to enter his own house, Obama’s criticism of the police backfired.
Many also objected when he sympathized with the parents of Trayvon Martin, a teenager shot dead by a self-appointed neighborhood watchman in Florida.
As Obama has been forced over the course of his presidency to find his voice on racial tensions and mass murders, he has made some of the most moving speeches of his presidency.
His anguish – whether for predominantly white schoolchildren gunned down in their Connecticut classroom by a disturbed white youth, or a group of African Americans murdered at their Charleston church by a white neo-Nazi – has clearly been genuine.
And his frustration at his inability to move the US Congress to pass meaningful gun control measures – owing to implacable opposition from the powerful National Rifle Association and its mostly Republican allies – has been as palpable as it is understandable.
Growing appreciation of Obama nowadays may reflect the shortcomings of Clinton and Trump – the most disliked presidential candidates in US history.
But it’s also true that Obama has conducted himself throughout his presidency with confidence, dignity, and a sure wit.
Indeed, there hasn’t been a tone-deaf moment in his two terms in office.
As the presidential campaign approaches the November election, the Republicans will of course continue to attack Obama.
But, barring some unforeseen development, it’s possible that he will remain the country’s most popular political figure until he leaves office.
When China's National People's Congress (NPC) concluded its annual meeting recently, it voted to enshrine protection of human rights and private property in the constitution.
But other major changes in China's development strategies that appear to be taking place have attracted far less notice.
China's current leadership, one year after coming to power, has criticized "the single-minded pursuit of GDP growth" over the past decade and unveiled a new approach to modernization characterized as "balanced, human-centered, and environmentally friendly."
The change in priorities - and outsiders' tendency to overlook it - is not difficult to understand.
The world is fascinated by China's economic miracle, but it is much less interested in the costs associated with the country's 8-9% annual growth rate in the past 25 years.
For instance, the energy consumption of every unit of Chinese industrial output is close to three times the global average.
Similarly, a recent Chinese bestseller, A Survey of Chinese Peasants , reveals the tremendous human costs of China's modernization drive.
The book caught the attention of both the elites and the mass public with its heart-breaking stories of the suffering endured by 900 million farmers and its bold criticism of the government's rural policies.
Beyond the glamorous skyscrapers of Beijing, Shanghai, and other urban centers, the majority of Chinese who live in the countryside have gained little from the material progress of the past two decades.
On the contrary, the initial benefits that peasants gained from the rural reforms of the late 1970's and early 1980's have disappeared; real income among farmers has dropped in recent years as their production costs rise and agricultural prices decline.
In most parts of China, farming can no longer sustain a respectable standard of living.
While average agricultural income grew by 90% in the 1994-97 period, the rural tax burden jumped by 800%.
More than 300 taxes and fees have been imposed on peasants by all levels of government.
For example, some townships demand 14 kinds of fees to register a marriage.
Today, a farmer's annual income is only one-sixth that of an urban dweller's, but he has to pay three times more in taxes.
This comes in addition to many other financial burdens exacted at the local level.
Indeed, 25 years of reforms have changed nothing of China's "one country with two systems" - a model that segregates China's urban centers from its agricultural areas, with development of the former realized at the expense of the latter.
If we use what is called the "Gini coefficient" to measure this income gap, with "0" indicating perfect equality of income distribution and "1" meaning perfect inequality, the number for China is 0.454 in 2002.
India, long known for gross disparities between rich and poor, has a Gini coefficient that has hovered around 0.30 to 0.32 over the past five decades.
A recent study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences concluded that China's urban-rural income gap is the worst on earth, maybe only slightly better than Zimbabwe.
The irony here is that China is widely hailed as a success story, while Zimbabwe is generally viewed as a failed state.
Such an unfair distribution of wealth based on economic exploitation, social injustice and political exclusion has caused silent but persistent resistance by Chinese peasants.
They protest, they petition, and they participate in local riots when all other means are exhausted.
As a result, the "peasant question" is now threatening social stability and is potentially explosive in a way reminiscent of when Mao organized his revolution around peasant disaffection with the rural policies of the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek.
In response, Premier Wen Jiabao announced a series of measures during the NPC, ranging from phasing out agricultural taxes over the next five years to measures aimed at increasing farmers' income.
But while official attention to rural poverty is music to the ears of the poor, experience shows that such promises are usually inadequate.
Wen's predecessor, Zhu Ronji, also said that his "biggest headache" was how to reduce the rural tax burden and increase peasant income.
China's government must acknowledge that deep income inequality and rural poverty is no longer exclusively an economic problem, but threatens social peace and political stability.
Unless China commits to greater political openness, allowing the poor and disadvantaged to voice their concerns, represent themselves, and monitor policy implementation, it will continue to be jeopardized by a false and perilous prosperity.
``Failed state'' is a term applied frequently to Afghanistan and is often deemed the cause for why terrorists gained such influence there.
But a country does not fail of its own volition, nor is it weakened by unknown causes.
Twenty years of invasion, civil war, and drought have left Afghanistan's institutions in ruin.
Millions of Afghans huddle in refugee camps or are displaced from their homes.
For these and many other reasons, rebuilding Afghanistan's economy will require not only economic reconstruction but an effort to reinvent the country's political and cultural institutions.
Such a massive effort will be doomed to failure, however, if Afghanistan's neighbors intervene in ways that promote economic upheaval all over again.
Any thought that the anti-terror coalition will be able to bail out fast (as the West did when it abandoned Afghanistan to its fate after the Soviet withdrawal ten years ago) should be forgotten.
Otherwise, it runs the risk of renewed chaos and violence, but this time in a more destabilized region, as Pakistan's current problems demonstrate.
Three problems are of immediate concern, the most important being feeding the Afghan people - both within the country and in refugee camps outside Afghanistan.
Humanitarian aid is being delivered, but a distribution system safe from the predations of Afghanistan's warlords needs to be built.
Indeed, the warlords have been given too big a say in distributing aid already, and it may be hard to strip them of this power.
The second problem involves relocating Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan and Iran, as well as those displaced within Afghanistan.
To achieve this goal, the agricultural economy must be revived in order to revive this industry, providing jobs and food for people.
A massive impediment here is the millions of mines left over from the Soviet invasion that must be removed.
Starving farmers, if unassisted, may return to cultivating a very reliable cash crop: the opium poppy, long a staple of the warlord economy.
Eliminating it will not only help farmers and the West as it tries to curtail heroin use, but also Afghanistan's infant government as it struggles to assert its national authority against the warlords.
A bankrupt warlord, after all, cannot buy weapons or bribe people to maintain their loyalty.
Cities such as Kabul, Mazar, Herat and others will need to be rebuilt as centers of economic and cultural life.
Roads, airports and communications systems must also be revitalized if trade is to be restored.
The educational system needs to be rebuilt almost from scratch, and with so many women anxious to return to teaching, a revived educational system will also help Afghanistan's democratic politicians gain a powerful lobby of workers.
Afghanistan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction, as it is not a society with a strong political center.
Planners should take advantage of the country's decentralized nature and emphasize private sector participation in reconstruction.
A decentralized system will respond better to local needs and avoid an over-bureaucratic public sector.
But autonomous economic regions should be avoided as a threat to Afghan national unity because they would play into the hands of the warlords.
There is the potential for oil and gas exploration, and of mining iron ore and precious metals.
Afghanistan, indeed, must be integrated into the regional pipeline and other development schemes.
Afghans can contribute in a tangible way here by reopening the North-South route connecting the resource rich economies of Central Asia to densely populated India and Pakistan.
None of this will be possible unless Afghanistan's young males are disarmed and given productive work.
Essential here, is to attract expatriate Afghans with skills and professional achievements to help in rebuilding the country by establishing small firms that will suck up the unemployed.
Expatriate involvement will also likely support the rights of women to participate fully and legally in economic and political life, as was the case before 1978.
Finally, donor countries must apply the lessons learned in restoring the war-ravaged states of the former Yugoslavia.
Grants and planning must be coordinated, and the consent of Afghanistan's neighboring countries assured.
An international conference on Afghanistan should be called by the US and held under UN auspices.
It must affirm not only Afghanistan's territorial integrity, but insure that donor commitments meet the scale of the job and that these promises are kept.
PRINCETON – “Do I have to go on my knees?” the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, asked the BBC’s Andrew Marr.
Lagarde was apologizing for the IMF’s poor forecasting of the United Kingdom’s recent economic performance, and, more seriously, for the Fund’s longer-standing criticism of the fiscal austerity pursued by Prime Minister David Cameron’s government.
Now endorsing British austerity, Lagarde said that it had increased confidence in the UK’s economic prospects, thereby spurring the recent recovery.
By issuing it, the IMF compromised on an economic principle that enjoys overwhelming academic support: The confidence “fairy” does not exist.
And, by bowing to the UK’s pressure, the Fund undermined its only real asset – its independence.
The IMF has dodged responsibility for far more serious forecasting errors, including its failure to anticipate every major crisis of the last generation, from Mexico in 1994-1995 to the near-collapse of the global financial system in 2008.
Indeed, in the 6-12 months prior to every crisis, the IMF’s forecasts implied business as usual.
Some claim that the Fund counsels countries in private, lest public warnings trigger the very crisis that is to be avoided.
But, with the possible exception of Thailand in 1997, the IMF’s long-time resident historian, James Boughton, finds little evidence for that view in internal documents.
The IMF’s Internal Evaluation Office is more directly scathing in its assessment of the Fund’s obliviousness to the US subprime crisis as it emerged.
Given that the IMF is the world’s anointed guardian of financial stability, its failure to warn and preempt constitutes a far more grievous lapse than its position on British austerity, with huge costs borne by many, especially the most vulnerable.
For these failures, the Fund has never offered any apology, certainly not in the abject manner of Lagarde’s recent statement.
In a September 2003 speech in Kuala Lumpur, then-Managing Director Horst Köhler conceded that temporary capital controls can provide relief against volatile inflows from the rest of the world.
He was presumably acknowledging that the Fund had it wrong when it criticized Malaysia for imposing such controls at the height of the Asian crisis.
Among the countries hurt by that crisis, Malaysia chose not to ask for the Fund’s help and emerged at least as well as others that did seek IMF assistance.
And even as the Fund opposed them, prominent economists – among them Paul Krugman – endorsed their use.
In his speech, Köhler reported that the Fund had taken the evidence on board and would incorporate it in its future advice.
But in the current crisis, the academic evidence has overwhelmingly shown that fiscal austerity does what textbook economics says it will do: the more severe the austerity, the greater the drag on growth.
A variety of studies confirming this proposition, including one by the IMF’s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, have withstood considerable scrutiny and leave little room for ambiguity.
The two public voices arguing for the magical properties of austerity are official agencies based in Europe: the OECD and the European Commission.
The Commission’s stance, in particular, is animated by an institutional commitment to a fiscal viewpoint that leaves no room for evidence.
Among the G-7 economies, only Italy has done worse than the UK since the Great Recession began.
Indeed, the UK’s GDP has only just regained its 2008 level, lagging behind even France.
This is all the more remarkable given that the crisis in the UK was comparatively mild.
The fall in property prices was modest relative to Ireland and Spain, and, because there was no construction boom, there was no construction bust.
Having missed the warning signs about the bank Northern Rock, which needed to be bailed out by the UK government after a run on its deposits in September 2007, the British authorities, unlike their eurozone counterparts, quickly dealt with the economy’s distressed banks.
For these reasons, the UK should have had a quick recovery; instead, the Cameron government’s gratuitous austerity stifled it.
Thumbing one’s nose at scholarly evidence is always a bad idea, but it is especially damaging to an institution that relies so heavily on the credibility of its technical competence and neutrality.
If the Fund embraces muddled economics, on what basis will it defend its policy advice?
Moreover, in choosing to flatter the UK’s misguided policy, the Fund has confirmed its deference to its major shareholders.
For years, the view has been that the IMF is a foreign-policy instrument of the United States.
The softness in its annual surveillance of UK economic policy has also been well known.
But in taking this latest step, the Fund has undermined – perhaps fatally – its ability to speak “truth to power.”
If so, a fundamental question may well become unavoidable: Why does the IMF exist, and for whom?
TALLINN – News media nowadays are rife with speculation about whether – if not when – US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will divide the world between them.
We in Estonia and the other Baltic states now fear being consigned to Russia’s sphere of influence once more.
Indeed, for many Baltic citizens, suppressed visions of torture, deportations, and flight – all experiences from our recent history – are once again bursting into our consciousness.
In the Baltics, we know well the feeling that our country is part of some great global game of money and manipulation.
We haven’t forgotten the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the other secret protocols by which Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler in 1939 altered the fate of our countries almost overnight.
Just a year later, the Soviet Union’s secret police began arresting and killing our parents and grandparents.
We also have another dark memory of that time: collaboration and appeasement.
Like anyone who has lived through occupation, violent regimes, and brutal wars, we know that trust, so long to develop, can be thrown away in an instant.
In Finland, Estonia, and throughout Europe, we are seeing a deeply worrying trend, with traditional values and principles being compromised by political maneuvering and money.
Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, believed that, by improving humans’ inner world, we could improve the outer world we all share.
He argued that culture – all kinds of knowledge that cultivate a social conscience – could be our salvation.
Many of the country’s leading artists, scholars, and doctors, having studied in the capitals of Europe, acted as cultural mediators.
The likes of Mikhail Bulgakov, Marina Tsvetaeva, Alexander Blok, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Wassily Kandinsky were all under Freud’s remedial spell.
The Russian psychoanalyst Tatiana Rosenthal believed she could reconcile Marxism with psychoanalysis.
But the Soviets were soon terrorizing, persecuting, and murdering the people she respected, and destroying Freud’s books, along with tens of millions of others.
Soon, they perverted psychiatry to serve their own interests, using it to “cure” political dissidents.
Once occupation began in 1940, Soviet forces began stripping Estonians of their Western mentality and memory by destroying some 26 million books.
During the major deportations of 1949, as 22,000 people were sent to Siberia, the last personal libraries were burned as well.
In 1941, Max Laosson, an author and editor of an Estonian psychoanalytic magazine, joined a Soviet destruction battalion.
As his former friends’ lives and careers were lost, he rose through the ranks, ultimately becoming a high-ranking Communist functionary.
For Laosson, conformity was a survival strategy; it contributed to the annihilation of culture and trust, but it worked.
In 1939, while living in London, he observed that his theory that people had a basic destructive urge had been proven.
He maintained hope, however, that, while culture could not cure humans of their destructiveness, it could help us to limit these instincts, at least in our shared outer world.
Was Freud – who died before the Nazis began burning people in extermination camps – right to think that we are capable of suppressing humanity’s urge for destruction?
The Finnish author and filmmaker Jörn Donner once wrote that books are incapable of preventing war.
Estonia had regained its independence, and I was seeking a kind of resolution for my mother, who had been taken as a young girl to a gulag.
I believed at that time, and I still do, that culture, as defined by Freud, can save humanity by ensuring that history doesn’t repeat itself.
So I made films and books that would expose the patterns of thought and behavior that underpin the devastating commands to kill and betray one’s neighbor.
Yet some now say that those destructive old networks and narratives are reawakening.
And when powerful forces – ideology, money, envy, or guilt – are activated, there are always those who are willing to betray or censor others.
The banal evil of which Hannah Arendt wrote is still very much alive.
According to the French philosopher Julia Kristeva, cultures die, but they may also kill.
I am not even confident that freedom of speech can be taken for granted anymore.
But, like Freud, I still have hope that – with the help not just of culture, but also of a civil society willing to defend it – we can learn to control our basest urges, and avoid another disastrous division of the world.
BERKELEY – In the circles in which I travel, there is near-universal consensus that America’s monetary authorities made three serious mistakes that contributed to and exacerbated the financial crisis.
This consensus is almost always qualified by declarations that the United States has been well served by its Federal Reserve chairmen since at least Paul Volcker’s tenure, and that those of us who have not sat in that seat know that we would have made worse mistakes.
· the decision was made to eschew principles-based regulation and allow the shadow banking sector to grow with respect to its leverage and its compensation schemes, in the belief that the government’s guarantee of the commercial banking system was enough to keep us out of trouble;
· the Fed and the Treasury decided, once we were in trouble, to nationalize AIG and pay its bills rather than to support its counterparties, which allowed financiers to pretend that their strategies were fundamentally sound;
· the Fed and the Treasury decided to let Lehman Brothers go into uncontrolled bankruptcy in order to try to teach financiers that having an ill-capitalized counterparty was not without risk, and that people should not expect the government to come to their rescue automatically.
There is, however, a lively debate about whether there was a fourth big mistake: Alan Greenspan’s decision in 2001-2004 to push and keep nominal interest rates on US Treasury securities very low in order to try to keep the economy near full employment.
In other words, should Greenspan have kept interest rates higher and triggered a recession in order to avert the growth of a housing bubble?
If we push interest rates up, Greenspan thought, millions of Americans would become unemployed, to no one’s benefit.
If interest rates were allowed to fall, these extra workers would be employed building houses and making things to sell to all the people whose incomes come from the construction sector.
Full employment is better than high unemployment if it can be accomplished without inflation, Greenspan thought.
If a bubble develops, and if the bubble does not deflate but collapses, threatening to cause a depression, the Fed would have the policy tools to short-circuit that chain.
But the question is: was the bet that Greenspan made a favorable one?
Whenever in the future the US finds itself in a situation like 2003, should it try to keep the economy near full employment even at some risk of a developing bubble?
I am genuinely unsure as to which side I come down on in this debate.
Central bankers have long recognized that it is imprudent to lower interest rates in pursuit of full employment if the consequence is an inflationary spiral.
Some days I think that, in the future, central bankers must also recognize that it is imprudent to lower interest rates in pursuit of full employment when doing so risks causing an asset price bubble.
Other days, however, I think that, even with the extra information we have learned about the structure of the economy, Greenspan’s decisions in 2001-2004 were prudent and committed us to a favorable and acceptable bet.
What I do know is that the way the issue is usually posed is wrong.
People claim that Greenspan’s Fed “aggressively pushed interest rates below a natural level.”
In the 1920’s, Swedish economist Knut Wicksell defined it as the interest rate at which, economy-wide, desired investment equals desired savings, implying no upward pressure on consumer prices, resource prices, or wages as aggregate demand outruns supply, and no downward pressure on these prices as supply exceeds demand.
On Wicksell’s definition – the best, and, in fact, the only definition I know of – the market interest rate was, if anything, above the natural interest rate in the early 2000’s: the threat was deflation, not accelerating inflation.
The natural interest rate was low because, as the Fed’s current chairman Ben Bernanke explained at the time, the world had a global savings glut (or, rather, a global investment deficiency).
You can argue that Greenspan’s policies in the early 2000’s were wrong.
But you cannot argue that he aggressively pushed the interest rate below its natural level.
Rather, Greenspan's mistake – if it was a mistake – was his failure to overrule the market and aggressively push the interest rate up above its natural rate, which would have deepened and prolonged the recession that started in 2001.
But today is one of those days when I don’t think that Greenspan’s failure to raise interest rates above the natural rate to generate high unemployment and avert the growth of a mortgage-finance bubble was a mistake.
Creating a computer that "thinks" is one goal of artificial intelligence research.
In 1950, the great British mathematician Alan Turing guessed that "thinking computers" would arrive by 2000.
But computers capable of simulating human thought processes are no closer today than they were then, because we put science before common sense.
Put simply, we failed to notice obvious and important facts about the nature of thought that exist right before our eyes.
Philosophy is intended to show us facts that are so obvious that we might miss them.
Most philosophers, it seems, have been asleep on the job for a long time.
In one, you are thinking about a problem - say, what pension plan you should join - logically and analytically.
In the second, you are thinking casually, drawing on experience rather than analysis.
In the third, you are looking out a window, letting your mind wander.
The single most important fact about thought follows from an obvious observation: these four styles are connected.
We can label them "analysis," "common sense," "free association," and "dreaming."
But the key point is that they are four points on a single continuous spectrum, with analysis at one end and dreaming at the other.
Psychologists and computer scientists like to talk about analysis and common sense as if they were salt and steel, or apples and oranges.
We would do better to think of them as red and yellow, separated not by some sharp boundary, but by a continuous range of red-oranges and orange-yellows.
As your alertness declines, your analytic ability declines - and you rely less on analysis, more on common sense.
(One of experimental psychology's most interesting findings is that people start to dream before they fall asleep, while they are still physiologically awake.)
Free-association and dreaming are blue and violet, with a beautiful spectrum of violet-blues in between.
To understand color, it is not enough to understand red and yellow, or blue and violet.
Likewise, to understand thought, it is not enough to understand "analysis" and "common sense," or "free association" and "dreaming."
It is therefore nonsense to believe that we can simulate thought on a computer without first understanding and simulating all of its component hues.
So, to put the same point another way, no thinking computer is possible until we can build a computer that hallucinates.
To understand the mind, we can conceive of it as being equipped with an imaginary dial marked "mental focus" or "alertness" or "attention."
(I do not know the physiological basis of "mental focus"; physiologists cannot tell me, because most of them also do not know what "mental focus" is.
Some are more comfortable than others thinking analytically, with their dials at "high focus."
(If we understood the physiological basis of mental focus, we would almost certainly have a better understanding about sleep disorders.)
Psychologists tried for generations to understand creativity, which is distinct from analytical thinking.
If you are good at analogies ("that fluttering oak leaf reminds me of a butterfly wing"; "that 17th-century clock is a computer with a round screen"), you have a basis for creative thinking, for approaching old problems in new ways.
Notice the similarity between falling asleep and thinking creatively - no matter how hard you try, you can not force yourself to do either.
Creative thinkers are most productive not when they are concentrating but when they are un -concentrating, when they are thinking not about the problem to be solved but about something else.
So, to think analytically you must set your "focus" to maximum; to think creatively, you must let your focus setting decline - but not so far that you fall asleep.
To complete the picture, we notice that emotion becomes increasingly important as "focus" falls.
Emotions then become "signatures" or "encodings" of complex thoughts.
When two ideas seem unrelated, but make you feel the same way, you have a basis for connecting them - and for inventing a new analogy.
Viewed from this perspective, it appears self-evident that no "thinking computer" whose focus is permanently set on high can come close to simulating human thought.
MOSCOW – Dmitry Medvedev’s election as Russia’s new president was virtually guaranteed.
Whether or not he can improve Russia’s economy after he takes office in May is far less certain.
To be sure, Vladimir Putin’s administration appears to have left Russia’s economy in a rosy state.
Foreign reserves stand at 30% of GDP and are the third highest in the world in absolute terms.
The middle class is buying foreign cars, vacationing abroad, and dining at sushi restaurants, and surveys show that life satisfaction has increased across the board.
The tax reform of 2001 improved incentives to work and decreased tax evasion by introducing a flat 13% income tax – one of the world’s lowest.
Liberalizing the procedures for corporate registration and licensing, and limiting inspections, improved the climate for small businesses and entrepreneurs.
Conservative macroeconomic policy and financial-sector reform lowered interest rates and fueled an investment and consumption boom.
Yet Medvedev’s most notable pre-election speech – unusually liberal even by Western standards – recognized several economic challenges.
Medvedev seems to understand that sustaining growth will not be easy: oil prices cannot rise forever, and the “low hanging fruit” of basic economic reform and prudent macroeconomic policies have already been picked.
According to Medvedev, the only solution is to empower private initiative and innovation.
Despite Russia’s recent economic achievements, both remain at alarmingly high levels.
According to Forbes magazine, there were 87 Russian billionaires, with combined wealth of $471 billion, a figure second only to the United States.
Yet their net worth accounts for roughly 30% of Russia’s GDP, whereas America’s 469 billionaires are worth only about 10% of US GDP.
According to a recent survey, a majority of Russians believes that acquiring wealth requires criminal activity and political connections.
Aside from the relatively small middle class and the even smaller business and intellectual elite, most Russians neither take risks to become entrepreneurs nor favor economic and political liberalization.
According to a recent large survey by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, only 36% of Russians support democracy and a mere 28% support market reform, by far the lowest among all transition countries on both counts.
In another World Bank-EBRD survey, 40% of firms in Russia reported making frequent unofficial payments, and roughly the same percentage indicated that corruption is a serious problem in doing business.
Unlike in other emerging markets, corruption has not declined with economic growth; it remains as high as in countries with one-quarter the per capita income of Russia.
One reason for sustained corruption is that Russia’s powerful bureaucracy stands to lose too much from economic liberalization.
Perhaps more importantly, it is hard to fight corruption without political reform, media freedom, and a vibrant civil society.
Remarkably, Medvedev is not wary of speaking about political liberalization.
Indeed, he quotes Catherine the Great: “Freedom is the soul of everything.
He knows that the rule of law is a pre-requisite for sustainable economic growth and promises to build an independent and effective court system.
Unfortunately, as Putin himself recently acknowledged, much of that agenda never materialized.
Implementing Medvedev’s program would benefit both Russia and the West.
This latter point should not be forgotten, because the West’s interests in Russia have grown since Putin was elected: foreign investment is booming, the middle class is hungry for all things Western, and even Russian companies are investing abroad.
Russia is already a large market, and if growth continues, it will be eligible to discuss OECD accession in a few years.
One lever that the West has is to condition membership on political and economic liberalization.
Medvedev appears to understand that such a new burst of liberalization is in Russia’s interest as well.
PARIS – Global policymakers regularly congratulate themselves on having avoided the policy errors of the 1930’s during the financial crisis that began in 2008.
Led by US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke, an economic historian of the Great Depression, they remembered the ideas of John Maynard Keynes and loosened monetary and fiscal policy to avoid the worst.
We are still coping with the budgetary consequences, especially in Europe, but it is true that the world did not end in 2008.
Monetary tightening was not the only major policy error of the 1930’s; so was a retreat into protectionism, symbolized by the Smoot-Hawley tariff increases at the beginning of that decade.
Historians continue to debate the centrality of the Smoot-Hawley law itself, but the subsequent tariff war certainly damaged trade and economic growth, making a bad situation worse.
Today’s statesmen like to say that they have avoided the protectionist error as well, but is that true?
Certainly I do not expect a tariff war to break out in the near term, but there are dangerous indicators of trade trouble ahead.
The Doha round of global free-trade talks has been abandoned, and the World Trade Organization is now languishing by the lake in Geneva, uncertain of its future.
Perhaps Doha was unlikely to achieve much in the current circumstances, but the absence of any continuing dialogue on world trade – at worst, a useful safety valve – adds a new level of risk.
In the financial arena, there are many signs of a revival of nationalistic approaches to regulation and currency policy.
The crisis challenged the Washington Consensus, which assumed that the world was moving gradually towards free movement of capital and market-determined exchange rates.
Several countries – including Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey – have now imposed capital controls of various kinds.
Even the International Monetary Fund, long the embodiment of the Washington Consensus, has acknowledged that “capital controls are a legitimate part of the toolkit to manage capital flows in certain circumstances.”
American Congressmen view the Chinese as archetypal currency manipulators, but the Swiss have introduced a firm cap on the franc’s appreciation.
These early signs of deglobalization of financial markets have their parallels in commercial banking, with some of the biggest global institutions retrenching rapidly.
Citibank and HSBC had gone further than most in developing a global footprint; indeed, one can hardly get on a plane nowadays without being reminded that the latter is “the world’s local bank.”
The impact is particularly vivid in trade finance, where European banks have been major participants in Asia.
Now they are in rapid retreat from that market, creating a worrying gap that Asian banks are seeking to fill.
As they struggle to raise new capital, European banks and insurers are likely to be forced to sell overseas assets.
If this were simply a sign of a new, tighter focus on viable long-term strategies, it might be regarded it as a benign development.
But there are indications that the process is being driven by regulatory change, and in some cases by regulatory protectionism.
Banks are overseen by a “home” regulator in their country of incorporation, and by a series of “host” regulators where they operate.
“Home” regulators and lenders of last resort are increasingly worried about their potential exposure to losses in banks’ overseas operations.
As Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, acutely observed, “banks are global in life, but national in death.”
In other words, home authorities are left to pick up the tab when things go wrong.
Host regulators are increasingly nervous about banks that operate in their jurisdictions through branches of their corporate parent, without local capital or a local board of directors.
From the banks’ perspective, that means that capital is trapped in subsidiaries, and cannot be optimally used across its network.
In the single financial market, banks are allowed to take deposits anywhere, without local approval, if they are authorized to do so in one European country.
Yet when the Icelandic banks failed, the British and Dutch authorities had to bail out local depositors.
Now regulators are discouraging such cross-border business, leading to a process with the ugly new name of “de-euroization.”
Regulators, recognizing the risks of allowing financial deglobalization to accelerate, have been seeking better means of handling the failure of huge global banks.
If banks can be wound up easily when things go wrong, with losses equitably distributed, regulators can more easily allow them to continue to operate globally and efficiently.
So a major effort to construct a cross-border resolution framework is under way.
But it is uphill work, and Daniel Tarullo, a governor of the Federal Reserve, has acknowledged that “a clean and comprehensive solution is not in sight.”
Does all of this amount to a serious threat to the benefits of globalization?
Perhaps we are just seeing the beginnings of a changing of the guard, and that HSBC and Citibank will be replaced as global players by China’s ICBC, Brazil’s Itau Unibanco, or Russia’s Sberbank.
But it may be that we are seeing a revival of a less benign Keynesian doctrine: “ideas, knowledge, science....should of their nature be international.
But let goods be homespun wherever it is reasonably and conveniently possible and, above all, let finance be national.”
VIENNA: The formation of a new government coalition in Austria has given rise to international criticism.
However, in studying international media reports, I cannot but notice that Austria has repeatedly been described in a rather undifferentiated and unbalanced way; a way that stands in sharp contradiction to the realities in our country.
Over the last fifty years, Austria has always been a responsible and reliable partner in Europe and the entire international community.
It will continue to live up to her traditional values and responsibilities, based on democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, openness, tolerance, humanitarian solidarity, a sense of duty and reliability.
It was signed, on 3 February 2000, in the presence of Federal President Thomas Klestil, by myself and the chairman of the Austrian Freedom Party, Jörg Haider - who remains Governor of Carinthia and did not join the Federal Government.
This document is binding on both of us as signatories, on our respective political parties, and on their democratically elected representatives.
Austria is strongly committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law that are common to all EU member states.
Significantly, two thirds of the Austrian electorate cast their votes in favor of membership in the European Union in 1994.
This support was considerably higher than in any of the other fourteen member states when they were joining the European Union.
In Austria's view, the Transatlantic Partnership, which has always been characterized by mutual respect and trust, will also have a special significance in ensuring future peace, stability, and prosperity.
Austria takes pride in its international solidarity with the victims of political repression, war, and expulsion.
We opened our doors in 1956 and 1968 during the crises in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and again in the 1990s when more than 100 000 refugees from the Balkans found a new home in our country.
As a proportion of Austria=s population of about 8 million, the number of Balkan refugees alone would be equivalent to over 1 million refugees in Germany and over 3 million in the United States.
Thus, over the last decades, Austria - more than most other countries - has demonstrated her profound social and humanitarian responsibility.
Austria's past calls for an intensely critical and sensitive approach to injustice, murder, and terror under the Nazi regime.
We have taken important steps to deal with this past, and the new Federal Government will continue on this path without hesitation.
Based on the findings of the interim report of the Austrian Historians' Commission, we will seek prompt compensation for former forced laborers, and we expect the companies concerned also to recognize their responsibilities.
To expedite matters, I have appointed a special representative for the question of forced and slave labor under the Nazi regime.
Mrs. Maria Schaumayer, the former head of the Austrian central bank, will head a new office to handle the issue of compensating the victims.
Among my government=s other commitments, compensation of aging victims of the Holocaust, who live in difficult financial circumstances, will be among our highest priorities in the next few months.
The Austrian Government will also support open access to archives in federal agencies and advocate a similar policy for non-governmental entities.
We will encourage Austrian insurance companies to participate in the work of the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims.
We will seek to improve the practical application of the Art Restitution Law of 1998 and encourage similar restitution steps among local and regional governmental bodies.
My Government is deeply committed to the protection of human rights and to combating racism and discrimination.
We have a highly developed national human rights legislation and practice, as well as a strong and independent judiciary.
Austria is party to practically all major international human rights treaties and has traditionally played an active part in their drafting.
We have not only ratified the European Human Rights Convention, we also made it a part of our own Constitution.
This means that anyone residing in Austria can file a complaint to the European Court for Human Rights, whose judgements are binding on the government.
Austria is also constitutionally bound by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
As Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria I will do my utmost do ensure the strict implementation of the Preamble and the Government Program (which can be found on the website of the Austrian Federal Government http://www.austria.gv.at.)
I myself and the other members of the Austrian Federal Government expect to be judged according to our performance rather than on the basis of prejudice.
NEW YORK – Internet firms are supposed to be all about the cutting edge, but reality and buzz sometimes conflict.
Consider Groupon: its focus is the power of groups, but its actual business is the old standby of direct-mail marketing and coupons.
But Groupon is spreading that model to a much wider audience – not so much to coupon users, but instead to merchants offering coupons.
In fact, Groupon is doing for e-mail marketing what other Internet companies are doing for the Yellow Pages or classified ads: encouraging merchants to use modern technology to reach their customers.
The model clearly makes sense for a lot of customers: Groupon now has more than 50 million subscribers and aims for 150 million by year-end.
Its revenues – about half the value of total transactions – were an estimated $760 million last year, and should hit $2 billion or more this year.
Unlike most Internet companies, it has a lot of employees relative to its revenues – about 5,000.
Thousands of companies have used Groupon to sell their wares, though Groupon does not disclose its rate of repeat sellers.
In theory, Groupon’s business model is “group coupons”: if enough people sign up, the deal “tips” into action (though now that Groupon is so large, few deals don’t tip).
In practice, Groupon’s original idea – to encourage users to form groups to negotiate with merchants – seems to have disappeared.
The notion of user empowerment has likewise vanished amid intense competition for the direct-to-consumer e-mail marketing business.
While privacy is a big issue in the online consumer business, it is a moot point in the Groupon world, because customers voluntarily and explicitly sign up to be targets (otherwise known as “opt-in”).
While some brave start-ups are trying to create “you-own-your-own-data” businesses, Groupon and its many clones/competitors simply appeal to the consumers’ lust for deals and discounts.
Soon enough, this model is likely to spread – but it is unlikely to be as centralized as search, whether for Groupon or some other competitor: just as users indicate their interests when searching the Internet, they sign up for deals that interest them.
So, you could say that Groupon is opening up e-mail marketing just as Yahoo! opened up search.
Yes, I said that on purpose: there is no guarantee that Groupon will be the long-term winner.
Other players, including Facebook (which can mine a 500-million-plus customer base), could give it strong competition, using newsfeeds or its evolving messaging functions rather than e-mail.
Groupon’s emergence is another step in the Internet’s move toward ever-greater efficiency and transparency.
That is good news for the strong players, but not so good for the weak.
Long ago, the online aggregators Expedia and Travelocity opened up the market.
In response, the leading airlines united to create Orbitz, in an effort to control the distribution of their services to consumers.
Now American Airlines is at war with Orbitz for control of its customers.
Increased transparency has made the airline business more “efficient,” but now airplane seats are hard to sell on any basis other than price.
In an effort to keep their headline prices low, airlines are tacking on surcharges for baggage, drinks, pillows, and other items that once were free.
Thanks to Groupon, merchants may face a similar, but perhaps even more damaging, fate.
They will wait for sales to buy, and merchants will find themselves competing ever more fiercely.
Meanwhile, merchants’ brand power will be eroded as consumers look to Groupon (as they do to Orbitz) rather than to them for the best deals.
The logic is simple: merchants are encouraged to use the deals to attract new customers, who in theory will return at full price.
But, in what seems to be an increasing number of cases, customers come for the deals, and then leave for deals offered by other merchants through Groupon.
So the number of “new” customers attracted by cheap prices increases, and the number of loyal customers decreases as shoppers prefer by become “new” again for whomever offers the best deal.
Over time, merchants are likely to lower the level of their discounts (they can’t afford to do otherwise).
But Groupon and its ilk will continue to offer an effective way for new merchants to enter the market and attract new customers.
Overall, this newly efficient market will be tough on both incumbents and new entrants.
All to the good, most people will say: more consumers get good deals, and bad companies have a tough time staying around or getting established in the first place.
As the market becomes more efficient, Groupon will have to work harder to keep its edge.
Its sales force is training thousands and perhaps millions of merchants to use e-mail marketing and coupons.
In the long run, they will figure out how to do it for themselves, and Groupon and its competitors are likely to offer self-service, just as Google does for search ads.
Merchants may well use intermediaries to reach consumers, but they are unlikely to continue to hand such a huge share of the revenues.
In other words, the market is working faster and faster, and it’s getting harder for anyone to stay ahead for long, whether it’s Groupon’s merchant-customers or Groupon itself.
If it can extend its power to daily deals, its competitors had better watch out!
BERKELEY – However bad you think the global economy is today in terms of the business cycle, that is only one lens through which to view the world.
In terms of global life expectancy, total world wealth, the overall level of technology, growth prospects in emerging economies, and global income distribution, things look rather good, while on still other dimensions – say, global warming or domestic income inequality and its effects on countries’ social solidarity – they look bad.
Even on the business-cycle dimension, conditions have been far worse in the past than they are today.
Consider the Great Depression and the implications of market economies’ inability back then to recover on their own, owing to the burden of long-term unemployment.
But, while we are not at that point today, the Great Depression is no less relevant for us, because it is increasingly likely that long-term unemployment will become a similar impediment to recovery within the next two years.
At its nadir in the winter of 1933, the Great Depression was a form of collective insanity.
Workers were idle because firms would not hire them; firms would not hire them because they saw no market for their output; and there was no market for output because workers had no incomes to spend.
By that point, a great deal of unemployment had become long-term unemployment, which had two consequences.
Because consumer prices fell faster than wages, the welfare of those who remained employed rose in the Great Depression.
Second, reintegrating the unemployed even into a smoothly functioning market economy would prove to be very difficult.
After all, how many employers would not prefer a fresh entrant into the labor force to someone who has been out of work for years?
The simple fact that an economy had recently undergone a period of mass unemployment made it difficult to recover levels of growth and employment that are often attained as a matter of course.
Devalued exchange rates, moderate government budget deficits, and the passage of time all appeared to be equally ineffective remedies.
Highly centralized and unionized labor markets, like Australia’s, did as poorly as decentralized and laissez-faire labor markets, like that of the United States, in dealing with long-term unemployment.
Fascist solutions were equally unsuccessful, as in Italy, unless accompanied by rapid rearmament, as in Germany.
In the end, in the US, it was the approach of World War II and the associated demand for military goods that led private-sector employers to hire the long-term unemployed at wages they would accept.
But, even today, economists can provide no clear explanation of why the private sector could not find ways to employ the long-term unemployed in the near-decade from the winter of 1933 to full war mobilization.
The extent of persistent unemployment, despite different labor-market structures and national institutions, suggests that theories that pinpoint one key failure should be taken with a grain of salt.
At first, the long-term unemployed in the Great Depression searched eagerly and diligently for alternative sources of work.
But, after six months or so passed without successful reemployment, they tended to become discouraged and distraught.
After 12 months of continuous unemployment, the typical unemployed worker still searched for a job, but in a desultory fashion, without much hope.
And, after two years of unemployment, the worker, accurately expecting to be at the end of every hiring queue, had lost hope and, for all practical purposes, left the labor market.
It was also the pattern of the long-term unemployed in Western Europe at the end of the 1980s.
And, in a year or two, it will be the pattern again for the long-term unemployed in the North Atlantic region.
I have been arguing for four years that our business-cycle problems call for more aggressively expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and that our biggest problems would quickly melt away were such policies to be adopted.
But, over the next two years, barring a sudden and unexpected interruption of current trends, it will become less true.
The current balance of probabilities is that two years from now, the North Atlantic’s principal labor-market failures will not be demand-side market failures that could be easily remedied by more aggressive policies to boost economic activity and employment.
Rather, they will be structural market failures of participation that are not amenable to any straightforward and easily implemented cure.
Emerging changes in the region’s balance-of-power may be of equal long term importance as today’s stock market tumult.
Summit talks between Russia’s president and Japan’s prime minister in early November, for example, produced far richer outcomes than anyone expected.
During long sauna discussions, Boris Yeltsin and Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed to conclude a peace treaty between Russia and Japan by the year 2000, something that has vexed both countries since WWII’s end.
Russia now wants to join the Asian power game by improving it’s ties with Tokyo.
But this can not happen unless the issue of four islands, the Kuriles, taken by Stalin in the waning days of WWII is settled.
In 1956, without closing the issue, the two countries agreed to end their state of war.
Nikita Khrushchev, indeed, promised to return two of the four islands if and when a peace treaty was signed.
In 1991, as the Cold War wound down, President Gorbachev conceded that there was a territorial problem between the two countries and hinted at a willingness to resolve the matter.
By 1993, however, President Yeltsin was talking tougher: "Let this be settled in the next century, by future generations," he argued in a speech before Oryol University students.
Impasse keeps the two countries at a distance, one side-effect being the relatively low Japanese investment in postcommunist Russia.
Now President Yeltsin seems to have accelerated his timetable by his promises to Hashimoto in Krasnoyarsk.
Some speculate that Yeltsin would like to go down in history as the man who solved Russia’s most troublesome territorial dispute.
Perhaps he also believes that Russia’s Far East cannot be developed without Japanese capital and technology.
Such growth is needed east of Irkutsk (where the population is only eight million) because, otherwise, the area may fall into China’s sphere of influence.
Indeed, next door, China’s "Northeast District" (formerly Manchuria) has about 100 million people.
Many Chinese, indeed, have taken advantage of warmer Sino/Russian relations to cross the border into Russia and set up and settle down as traders.
Premier Hashimoto went some way to allaying Russian fears here by promising to assist in improving Siberian railways and other transport systems.
Hashimoto also proposed an increased level of security cooperation, including the exchange of visits between the Chairman of the Japanese Joint Staff Council and the Russian Joint Chief of Staff.
Some form of joint military exercises, something which Japan and China have not yet contemplated, were also broached.
The shifts in Yeltsin’s attitude must be seen in the context of Nato’s forthcoming expansion, and the closer security ties between America and Japan forged since April 1996.
Both events pushed Yeltsin into his so-called "strategic partnership" with China, with both partners sharing distrust of America acting the dominant hegemon.
But Yeltsin must suspect that Russia’s Pacific role would be handicapped so long as it remained tied with a China on bad terms with America.
Good relations for Tokyo are not just beneficial for developing Siberia, but may lead to membership in Apec (Asia-Pacific Economic forum) .
Apec’s original intent was to promote economic cooperation and trade liberalization in the region.
Since 1993, however, it has become an occasion for informal multilateral and bilateral summits among the heads of government of some 20 member states.
(The recent Vancouver summit discussions on the region’s financial crisis are a case in point.)
By somehow reaching agreement on the territorial dispute between Japan and Russia, Yeltsin will move toward developing a strategic partnership with Japan.
In order not to slight the Chinese, a week after his meetings with Hashimoto, Yeltsin flew to Beijing to stage, however awkwardly, an embrace with President Jiang Zemin, who had also just come back from his trip to the United States.
The Yeltsin/Jian summit was paralled by a visit to Tokyo by Russia’s foreign minister Primakov.
The diplomatic dance continued soon after, with China’s premier Li Peng arriving in Tokyo.
What is afoot now is the most intense interaction among the region’s four powers anyone has seen in decades.
The old US/China/Japan triangle may be on the way out if Moscow’s ties with Tokyo improve.
The irony is that it seems to have taken a push from the West – ie, Nato expansion – to concentrate the Kremlin’s mind on the East.
NEW YORK – Continued discrimination against Roma in Europe not only violates human dignity, but is a major social problem crippling the development of Eastern European countries with large Roma populations.
Spain, which has been more successful in dealing with its Roma problem than other countries, can take the lead this month as it assumes the European Union presidency.
Despite the region’s overall economic growth over the past two decades, life for many Roma is worse now than ever.
But the heavy industries in which many were employed have now closed, and unemployment is widespread.
The majority population is very hostile towards Roma, and discrimination against them occurs at every level.
For example, Roma children are often automatically put into classes for the mentally disabled, simply because they are Roma.
Despite court rulings ordering reform, Roma are regularly denied equal access to housing, education, and healthcare, creating a vicious cycle of poverty and marginalization.
The EU is slowly realizing that it has a major social problem on its hands.
Denied opportunities in the East, many Roma have moved to Western Europe, fueling a new wave of hostility.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government’s treatment of Roma settlements – destroying homes and fingerprinting Roma based solely on their ethnicity – blatantly violated human rights.
This prompted the EU to create the new position of Fundamental Rights Commissioner, with confirmation hearings set to begin in January;
On a positive note, the Decade of Roma Inclusion, established in 2005, is receiving strong support from the structural funds administered by the European Commission and is making some inroads.
Yet this is not enough to reverse a rising tide of violence and discrimination, compounded by the recent economic recession.
What is needed now is a comprehensive European strategy to address Roma issues across borders.
This strategy must address both intolerable living conditions for Roma and the hostile stereotypes that prevail within majority populations, because they mutually reinforce each other.
Following current demographic trends, by 2040, Roma will comprise roughly 40% of Hungary’s working-age population.
Unless the Roma are well educated and socially integrated – in stark contrast to today’s reality – these countries’ economic future is bleak.
The key to success is the education of a new generation of Roma who do not seek to assimilate into the general population, but deliberately retain their identity as Roma.
Educated, successful Roma will shatter the prevailing negative stereotypes by their very existence.
My foundation network has made the education of Roma a priority since its inception in Hungary in 1984, and across the rest of Eastern Europe since 1989.
These efforts have produced a small, well-educated Roma elite who are now making an important contribution to the emancipation of Roma.
These leaders have blazed a trail for future advocates, but there are far too few of them.
In conjunction with the launch of the Decade of Roma Inclusion in 2005, my foundation network formed an alliance with the World Bank and transferred its Roma educational programs to a newly established Roma Education Fund.
Last year, the Fund directly assisted 30,000 Roma children and 800 university students.
It also provided invaluable support to member countries’ public education systems to strengthen Roma inclusion.
The Fund plans to double its activities in the next five years, but, again, this is not enough.
The scale of this challenge demands a comprehensive, institutional response from the EU that goes well beyond the Decade and the capacity of my foundations.
While the European Roma Platform launched in 2009 paid lip service to Roma issues, it did not go far enough.
Europe must develop a long-term strategy tied to programs and monitoring mechanisms that will deliver real change on the ground.
Spain can be justly proud of the way it has dealt with its own Roma minority.
I hope that the Spanish EU Presidency will build on this experience to champion the launch of a comprehensive European Roma strategy.
If Spain leads the way, all of Europe will ultimately reap the benefits.
LAS VEGAS – Las Vegas seems to be an apt place to launch a risky corporate gamble that could destroy the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers.
Earlier this month, the international food conglomerate Cargill chose the city’s famous Strip to introduce what it hopes will be its next blockbuster product: EverSweet, a sweetener made of “the same sweet components in the stevia plant.”
And yet, despite Cargill’s heavy reliance on stevia in its promotional material, EverSweet does not contain a single leaf of the plant.
Cargill’s new product is an example of synthetic biology, a form of genetic engineering that uses modified organisms to manufacture compounds that would never be produced naturally.
What makes EverSweet taste sweet is not stevia; it is a compound produced by a bioengineered yeast.
Synthetic biology is high-tech, and it is also potentially high-risk.
Even as it attracts billions of dollars in investment, it is the subject of growing international concern.
Tellingly, Cargill does not advertise its use of the controversial technology; instead, the company describes EverSweet as the product of “specially crafted baker’s yeast,” as if it were a recipe brewed for centuries in Bavarian villages.
Discerning the risks that may be posed by food ingredients made from this kind of genetic engineering – different from those known from other types of transgenic foods – is still at an early stage.
In a recent opinion, European Union scientific committees concluded that while the risk assessment used for evaluating genetically modified organisms should be applicable to aspects of synthetic biology, in specific cases new approaches may be needed to evaluate the safety of the technology.
And yet there is one area in which the dangers are already apparent: the economic damage that will be caused as lab-grown compounds replace field-grown stevia.
The Guarani indigenous people of Paraguay have grown and used the herb for centuries.
More recently, it has become a food-industry craze, driven in part by fear of obesity lawsuits.
As major brands like Coke and Pepsi aggressively market stevia-sweetened cola drinks as natural and healthy, the agricultural acreage of the plant has exploded.
Analysts expect the stevia market to reach $275 million by 2017.
The global leaders in stevia production are Paraguay, China, and the United States, with Kenya close behind.
Early in 2015, Marian Bassey (representing the ETC Group) met stevia farmers in Kenya to understand what competition from synthetic biology might mean for them.
For Ann Nduta Kanini, a widowed mother of eight, selling stevia has allowed her to send her children to school and put food on the table.
When we asked Paul Mwangi Kigaa, another small-scale farmer, what Cargill’s use of synthetic biology would mean for him and his neighbors, he answered that “growing stevia in their factories will affect our lives!”
Moreover, poor farmers have been actively encouraged to invest in stevia, because its cultivation can help preserve fragile and unique ecosystems.
In its annual survey of leading global risks, the World Economic Forum noted that, “the invention of cheap, synthetic alternatives to high-value agricultural exports … could suddenly destabilize vulnerable economies by removing a source of income on which farmers rely.”
Ingredients that are being replaced or are likely to be exchanged for products made through synthetic biology include vanilla, saffron, coconut oil, patchouli, olive squalene, and rose oil.
Indeed, the world’s largest cosmetics, flavor, and fragrance companies are hoping that synthetic biology will help them replace more than 200 natural botanical extracts.
According to the International Federation of Essential Oils and Aroma Trades (IFEAT), around 95% of these botanical products are produced by small-scale farmers, bringing much-needed cash income to some of the world’s poorest communities.
Fortunately, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the risks posed by synthetic biology, and companies are responding.
Earlier this year, the iconic ice cream brand Ben and Jerry’s pledged not to use any ingredients produced through synthetic biology.
Similarly, Häagen-Dazs confirmed that it will not use vanilla flavor produced through synthetic biology in its ice cream.
And, after the natural cleaning products brand Ecover was petitioned by tens of thousands of angry consumers, the company quickly rolled back an experiment in which it used algal oil produced through synthetic biology in a laundry detergent.
The Non-GMO Project, an increasingly influential labeling organization, has ruled that the 33,000 products carrying its seal must not use synthetic biology.
Meanwhile, the European Stevia Association (EUSTAS), has expressed concern that EverSweet will undermine stevia’s reputation as safe and natural.
The dark clouds gathering around synthetic biology may not have been visible at Cargill’s sunny product launch.
But, by competing with poor farmers and misleading consumers about the origins of its ingredients, EverSweet and other examples of synthetic biology are generating bitterness at both ends of the product chain.
CHICAGO: NATO's stated reason for bombing Yugoslavia is to enforce international law prohibitions on war crimes, crimes against humanity, and perhaps even genocide.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright maintains that NATO is bombing "to uphold the law."
The U.S. Senate is pressuring President Clinton to ensure that the war crimes tribunal in The Hague indicts Slobodan Milosevic.
David Scheffer, the U.S. Ambassador for War Crimes, proclaims NATO's unprecedented enforcement of human rights to be a "watershed" for international law.
The problem with these legalistic arguments is that NATO itself is flouting international law.
The NATO operation shows how the efficacy of international human rights law depends on its selective application.
NATO is violating international law in order to uphold it, and NATO would not be upholding international law if it were subject to it.
In large part out of concern for human rights, the Charter prohibits one nation's use of force against another unless the Security Council authorizes the attack or unless the attack is a self-defensive response to armed aggression across recognized borders.
The illegality of NATO's attack, combined with NATO's destruction of civilian targets, might also constitute war crimes.
Yugoslavia is pressing many of these legal claims before the International Court of Justice.
In addition, as the UN's chief human rights officer recently noted, NATO's possible war crimes fall within the jurisdiction of the same war crimes tribunal that might indict Mr. Milosevic.
NATO and U.S. officials who rail against the illegality of Yugoslavia's atrocities in Kosovo scoff at claims that NATO's bombing might violate international law.
These officials confuse the motive for NATO's actions with the legality of such actions.
NATO's intervention was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns, and in part by the need to resolve a crisis of credibility and purpose.
But NATO' s motives, benign or not, are no defense to illegality.
None of this is to suggest that NATO's illegal acts will be remedied by the institutions of international law.
The war crimes tribunal in The Hague, established and dominated by western countries, will never indict, much less convict, a NATO official.
And no country is likely to bomb a NATO country to redress NATO violations of international law in the Balkans.
In short, NATO is immune from the very international laws it purports to enforce.
NATO's opportunistic invocation of international human rights law is but one example of the broader double standard that characterizes this law.
No nation on earth more aggressively enforces international human rights law against other countries.
And no nation on earth more aggressively resists the application of international human rights law to itself.
The United States stands nearly alone in refusing to join the Land Mine Treaty, the Rights of the Child Convention, or the International Criminal Court.
When it does ratify human rights treaties, it renders them inapplicable to U.S. officials.
And though the United States invokes international human rights institutions when doing so suits its purposes, it renounces these institutions when they attempt to assert jurisdiction over the United States.
The U.S. provides extraordinary (though imperfect) human rights protections within its borders in virtue of its domestic legal system.
So its failure to apply international human rights law in its domestic sphere makes little practical difference to the rights available there.
The United States resists application of human rights law to its activities abroad because it has unique human rights enforcement obligations, and thus potential exposure to the strictures of human rights law.
That said, the United States' opportunistic use of human rights law rhetoric -- on full display in the Balkans conflict -- still seems hypocritical.
The double standard that underlies this hypocrisy, however, is an inevitable feature of international human rights law.
International law is often criticized as toothless because it lacks a dependable centralized enforcement mechanism.
Some aspects of international law -- for example, principles of diplomatic immunity, or international communications standards -- have little need for such a sanctioning authority.
If one nation -- say, Yugoslavia -- is otherwise inclined to abuse its citizens, it will perceive no reciprocal benefit from compliance with an international norm that requires greater respect for human rights.
A nation like Yugoslavia is unlikely to comply with international human rights law unless other nations -- say, NATO -- sanction non-compliance.
It is also why the rare enforcement of human rights law that we do see tends to conform to the enforcing nation's political interests.
For example, the U.S. government intervenes in Haiti to avoid a flood of refugees and imposes sanctions on Cuba because of domestic political benefits.
But it does not sanction Turkey or China for their human rights abuses, because such sanctions are strategically too costly.
International human rights law thus depends on powerful nations for enforcement, which in turn means that powerful nations are not subject to this law when they violate it.
Whether the illegality of human rights enforcement actions ultimately matters will depend on the success of these actions.
At this point, it is far from obvious that the humanitarian benefits of NATO's intervention will outweigh the costs of the intervention -- costs measured in lives lost as a result of NATO acts and in the larger danger that the intervention poses to international order.
SEOUL – Asian countries have been watching the Greek crisis unfold with a mixture of envy and schadenfreude.
When they experienced their own financial crisis in 1997, they received far less aid, with far harsher conditions.
But they also recovered much more strongly, suggesting that ever-growing bailouts may not be the best prescription for recovery.
Since the onset of the crisis, Greece has received massive financing from the so-called “troika”: the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
It received bailout packages in 2010 and 2012 totaling €240 billion ($266 billion), including €30 billion from the IMF, more than triple Greece’s cumulative limit for IMF borrowing.
By contrast, South Korea’s 1997 bailout package – which was larger than those received by Indonesia, Thailand, or the Philippines – totaled $57 billion, with $21 billion coming from the IMF.
At the time, South Korea’s annual GDP was $560 billion; in 2014, Greek GDP amounted to less than $240 billion.
For starters, at the onset of the crisis, then-IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn was a leading candidate to become President of France.
More generally, major IMF shareholders, the European Union, and the United States have a vital interest in stabilizing Greece to safeguard French and German banks and preserve NATO unity.
Desmon Lachman, a former deputy director of the IMF’s policy department, has called the institution a slush fund, abused by its political masters during the Greek crisis.
To be sure, the economic mess created in Greece – the result of government profligacy, official corruption, and widespread tax evasion – merited some international assistance.
And the IMF did impose conditions on its loans to Greece – including fiscal austerity, privatization, and structural reform of its pension and tax systems – most of which were necessary to address the country’s insolvency.
The requirements of the latest rescue deal are the toughest yet – even tougher than those that Greek voters overwhelmingly rejected in a referendum earlier this month.
But the scale of the aid remains massive, especially when one considers how little progress Greece has made in implementing the reforms it promised in the past.
Unlike Greece, Asia’s problem was not an insolvency crisis, but a liquidity crisis, caused by a sudden reversal of capital flows.
In South Korea, net private-capital inflows of 4.8% of GDP in 1996 swung to net outflows of 3.4% of GDP in 1997.
Though the accumulation of substantial short-term debts in the financial system and corporate sector did amplify the shocks, the primary factors fueling the crisis were the lack of international liquidity, panicked behavior by investors, and financial contagion.
Yet the IMF imposed even tougher conditions on Asia than it has on Greece, including fiscal austerity, monetary tightening, and financial restructuring.
Some of these requirements were clearly unnecessary, as evidenced by Malaysia, which recovered quickly from the crisis without IMF assistance.
Once confidence began to recover and market conditions stabilized, the East Asian economies shifted their monetary and fiscal policies toward expansion and embraced large-scale exchange-rate depreciation – efforts that enhanced their export competitiveness.
Structural reforms, including the immediate closing of financial institutions and the elimination of non-performing loans, also helped to bolster recovery.
In South Korea, for example, real GDP growth quickly rebounded from -6.7% in 1998 to 9.5% in 1999.
By mid-2003, some 776 of the country’s financial institutions were closed.
And the authorities’ strong commitment to reform restored investor confidence, reviving inflows of private capital and reactivating foreign trade.
Instead of dropping to 110% as planned, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has increased to 170%.
Annual per capita real income contracted 4.8%, on average, over the last six years.
Unemployment stands at 26%, and hovers around 50% among young people.
Against this background, it was not shocking that Greece, unable to come up with €1.5 billion at the end of June, became the first developed country to miss a payment to the IMF.
Belatedly, the Fund acknowledged that its lending and policy advice had failed in Greece.
Greece’s government then demanded more financial support with less stringent conditions.
But, as its creditors have now recognized, providing more money will not address Greece’s insolvency.
That is why the new deal requires that the government immediately cut pensions, hike taxes (beginning with the value-added tax), liberalize the labor market, and adhere to severe spending constraints.
At the same time, a write-down of official debt, like the “haircut” given to private creditors in 2012, will be necessary.
Many have questioned whether agonizing reforms are entirely necessary; if the country returned to the drachma, they suggest, it could implement interest-rate cuts and devalue its exchange rate, thereby engineering an export-led recovery.
But, given Greece’s small export sector, not to mention the weakness of the global economy, such a recovery may be impossible.
So far, Greece has shown itself to be unwilling to implement a painful internal-wage adjustment and reform measures forced by outsiders.
Perhaps the latest deal, which was reached with Greece on the brink, will prove to be a turning point, with Greece finally committing actively to economic and fiscal reform.
Otherwise, Greece’s exit from the eurozone – with all the concomitant social and economic strife – seems all but inevitable.
Asians watch with sympathy the fall from grace of the birthplace of Western civilization.
But perhaps Greece should look to Asia for proof that, by taking responsibility for its own destiny, a country can emerge stronger from even the most difficult trials.
In his gushing account of President George W. Bush, the former presidential speechwriter David Frum tells us that his boss "scorned the petty untruths of the politician."
We learn, for example, that when asked to prepare a radio broadcast for the following day, he would begin reading, "Today I am in California" and quickly break off, saying with exasperation, "But I'm not in California."
Frum thought this a bit pedantic, but concluded that it was emblematic of the President's character and that "the country could trust the Bush administration not to cheat and not to lie."
Bush may naively consider it lying, and therefore wrong, to say that he is in California when he is recording a speech in Washington.
But he fails to see anything gravely wrong about misleading his country and the world concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
As we have seen, the White House built its case for war on a highly selective dossier of evidence, and Bush made statements about Iraq's attempt to purchase uranium from Africa that he and his staff knew to be highly doubtful, if not false.
When questions were raised about how the statement about uranium was allowed to remain in Bush's State of the Union address, both National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld argued that it was not a lie.
Their reasoning indicates that they, like the President, have a childishly literal notion of what it is to lie.
Bush's actual words were these: "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."
Bush's statement took this form because the CIA objected to the original version, which flatly stated that Saddam Hussein had sought to buy uranium from Africa.
The White House staff member who discussed it with the CIA then suggested changing the sentence so that it stated that the British reported that Saddam Hussein had sought to buy uranium from Africa.
It was nevertheless misleading, for the CIA had informed the British that their information was not reliable.
The fact that Bush only referred to a British statement is the basis for Rice and Rumsfeld's defense of it.
Rice said that "the statement that [Bush] made was indeed accurate.
In fact, even on the most literal interpretation, Bush's statement was not accurate.
Bush did not say merely that the British had "reported" that Iraq had sought to buy uranium from Africa, but that the British had ``learned'' this.
To say that someone has learned something is to endorse what they say they have learned as true.
Imagine that the British had said that Saddam Hussein was a peace-loving man about to bring democracy to his country.
Quite apart from these weak attempts to justify Bush's statement as "technically accurate," the more serious charge is that even if what Bush said really were technically accurate, it still would have been designed to mislead the world into thinking that Iraq had been trying to buy uranium in Africa.
Bush and his staff had good reason to believe that this was not true.
Bush's response to the issue after it became public shows him to be focused on the trivial and morally reckless about the essential.
A person who is morally sensitive to the seriousness of starting a war on the basis of misleading information would take appropriate steps.
He would ensure that the American public knew how the error occurred, and that whoever was responsible for it suffered the usual consequences that befall senior officials who make what was--to put the best possible interpretation on it--a grave error of judgment.
When the issue became public, Bush's response was to condemn his critics as "revisionist historians" and to evade questions about the credibility of the information he had provided by asserting that the removal of Saddam was a good outcome.
Then he said that the CIA had cleared his speech, as if that absolved him of all responsibility.
After CIA Director George Tenet took responsibility for the inclusion of the misleading material, Bush said that he "absolutely" had confidence in Tenet and the CIA, and that he considered the matter closed.
Belief in Bush's honesty led many voters to prefer him to Albert Gore in the 2000 presidential election.
Among voters who rated "honesty" as an important factor influencing their choice of candidate, 80% said that they voted for Bush.
These voters were disgusted with Clinton, not only for his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, but for lying about it.
That Clinton did lie about his sexual activities is clear, and he was wrong to do so.
But his lies did not lead his country into a war that has cost thousands of lives.
Bush's excessively literal interpretation of the requirements of honesty conceals a deeper dishonesty whose consequences have been far more morally serious.
HONOLULU – My three-year-old niece believes strongly in the power of “the good guys.”
Whenever I visit, she drags me to the bookshelf in her room and pulls out book after book, each with the same conclusion: in battles big or small, the good guys always win.
I don’t have the heart to tell her that, in the real world, clean fights and gratifying outcomes are the exception.
Modern warfare follows no rules, and loyalties are never black and white.
For me, nothing illustrates this truth more terribly than the surge in violence directed at schools and educators in conflict areas.
In May of this year, the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack will publish its “Education Under Attack” report, which confirms that wars and military engagements are affecting education more severely than any time in recent memory.
Around the world, some 80 million children are unable to attend school because of violence.
In the first half of 2017, there were more than 500 attacks on schools in 20 countries, a significant increase from previous years.
According to the United Nations, in 15 of those countries, government soldiers or rebel forces seized schools for military use.
For obvious reasons, governments that support the targeting of schools and educators in any capacity must be held to account.
Children forced to live in conflict zones are already suffering; when violence prevents them from learning, they suffer a double tragedy.
Before the current conflict in Syria, for example, the enrollment rate for primary school was above 90%.
Today, in areas most affected by the fighting, it has dropped to below 30%.
In Yemen, with war and famine raging, more than two million children between the ages of six and nine are out of school.
And nearly half of the 700 UN-administered schools in Syria, Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Jordan have been attacked or shut down at least once in recent years.
Humanitarian crises often produce a surge in political will; the needless suffering of others, and especially of children, pushes the international community to dedicate money and energy to ameliorating the misery.
Unfortunately, that generosity rarely extends to supporting education in war-torn areas.
Of the millions of children not attending school around the world, one in four lives in a crisis-affected country.
Yet, education accounts for just 2% of total humanitarian aid, while only 38% of emergency aid requests for education are met.
In April 2000, when the Dakar Framework for Action was adopted, signatories identified conflict as a “major barrier” to attaining the goal of “education for all,” one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The report also expressed the consensus view that governments and civil-society groups must move swiftly to “reconstruct destroyed or damaged education systems” whenever possible.
Why, then, nearly two decades after the framework was signed, is this commitment to rebuilding routinely ignored?
Each year of additional schooling increases a learner’s earnings by 10%, on average, improving their long-term financial stability, and helping to lower the risk of a return to violence.
In other words, as I explained at a recent panel organized by the Education Above All Foundation at the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), attacks on education are quite literally attacks on our collective future.
Girls are are 2.5 times more likely than boys to be out of school in conflict-affected areas.
Yet investing in girls has long-term benefits that can transform communities and eradicate poverty.
Educated girls are less likely to marry at a young age, and more likely to have fewer, healthier children.
Moreover, women in the workforce reinvest 90% of their incomes to their communities.
Countries enduring and emerging from violence may not have the financial capacity to rebuild schools while simultaneously funding reconstruction.
The global community must find the $2.3 billion needed to improve access to education in conflict zones.
At the same time, donors must fund institutions that will help children traumatized by the psychological stress of war.
For many children in conflict areas, psychosocial and emotional support is as important as educational opportunity.
The world of my niece’s picture books – where every struggle in summarized in 20 pages and ends with a “happily ever after” – will never be reality.
But, in the absence of fairy godmothers and protective witches, the world needs workable solutions that can help the good guys (and girls) win.
By educating every child, even those in harm’s way, we may succeed in making the world just a little less wicked.
PARIS – The topics chosen by the European Central Bank for its annual forum in Sintra, Portugal, at the end of May were not deflation, quantitative easing, or financial stability.
ECB President Mario Draghi explained why in his introductory speech: The eurozone lacks both growth momentum and resilience to adverse shocks.
The European Commission now expects growth in the eurozone to reach 1.5% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016.
That certainly looks good in comparison to the near-stagnation of recent years.
But, given the combination of massive monetary support, a now-neutral fiscal stance, a steep fall in oil prices, and a depreciated euro, it is the least we could expect, and it will bring per capita GDP back only to its 2008 level.
The fact that leaders and pundits are hailing this brighter outlook indicates just how diminished our expectations have become.
Until recently, fiscal austerity and the euro crisis could be blamed for poor economic performance.
Although growth may exceed the Commission’s forecast, there are reasons to be concerned about the eurozone’s growth potential.
In order to strengthen that potential, central bankers can only advocate economic reforms; it is governments that are responsible for adopting them.
After all, central banks are quick to rebut monetary-policy suggestions from governments in the name of independence.
Draghi has good reason to insist that, in the absence of significant national action, the eurozone might well stumble from crisis to crisis until its very viability is jeopardized.
Participation in a monetary union is a demanding endeavor that requires policy agility among its participating countries, as well as a sense of common purpose.
But governments have good reason to argue that, as far as reforms are concerned, policymaking requires precision and political realism, which outside advice often lacks.
A natural solution could be for the ECB to rely on the other European institutions.
Since 2010, the EU has been piling up coordination procedures in the hope of pushing governments into enacting politically difficult reforms.
Each year, every member country is handed a to-do list of public spending, labor-market, and competition reforms, as well as other recommendations.
The European Commission is also trying to lure reluctant governments into bolder action by offering them more fiscal room.
And, two years ago, German Chancellor Angela Merkel floated the idea of individually tailored “reform contracts” that, again, would create incentives for governments to enact pro-growth reforms.
But the effectiveness of these initiatives has proved to be limited, to say the least.
Schemes aimed at strengthening policy coordination have merely added complexity to an already Byzantine architecture of procedures.
Recommendations issued to individual countries lack both traction in national capitals and coherence at the eurozone level.
The EU has a strong hand when a country is in need of financial assistance, but otherwise it can do little more than offer counsel.
The eurozone must overcome this shortcoming, but no simple solution is at hand.
There is broad agreement that streamlining is required; but that will not suffice.
Some advocate further centralization of decisions; but that will not help, either, because reforms are intrinsically national, if not sub-national.
First, the ECB’s analysis of the economic challenges facing the eurozone should be very transparent.
Governments should know precisely how Draghi and his colleagues assess the potential for growth and employment and how this will affect monetary policy.
They should have a clear idea of what they can expect from the ECB and what outcome (rather than precise measures) the ECB expects from them.
Second, the EU should support the creation of national institutions to monitor domestic developments and their compatibility with overall eurozone goals.
These could be modeled on the fiscal councils that were created a few years ago in each member country to assess national governments’ public-finance plans.
Because they are part of the national conversation, these councils have proved to be a useful addition.
In the same way, competitiveness councils could monitor the evolution of wages and prices, employment and growth, and the current account, and provide recommendations to national governments and social partners.
Such institutions would be much better placed than the EU to formulate timely and granular reform recommendations.
They could operate as a network, rely on similar methodologies, and thus help ensure more consistency among individual policies.
Third, the EU could foster aggregate action in high-priority areas by implementing schemes to support individual citizens, companies or public entities, access to which would be conditional on national policies fulfilling minimal requirements.
For example, the EU could create a training support scheme for unemployed young people, but make it contingent on the elimination of national policies that hinder youth employment.
Or it could create a scheme to support higher education, but reserve it for universities in countries where educational institutions have been granted a minimum degree of autonomy.
The justification would be that EU money can help only in the context of supportive national policies in the same field.
Conditionality of this sort would be positive, local, and non-punitive; it would serve as a carrot, not a stick.
These are modest proposals, because, when it comes to pro-growth reform in Europe, there is no magic bullet.
But the measures recommended here would serve to build a more decentralized, incentive-based policy regime.
WASHINGTON, DC – North Koreans relish the element of surprise when they get to choose the stage and command the theatrics.
The unexpected visit of three top leaders of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon last week, stole the show from the athletes.
The three visitors – Hwang Pyong-so, Vice Chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission, and two other senior officials from the Workers’ Party of Korea, Choe Ryong-hae and Kim Yang-gon – met with the South Korean prime minister, national security adviser to the president, and the head of the Ministry of Unification.
It was a rather merry occasion, with leaders on both sides promising to meet again next month and offering abundant smiles and handshakes for the cameras.
Korea observers are wondering what this means for the future of the inter-Korean relationship.
Is the government in Pyongyang trying to send a message to South Korea, the United States, and China?
Will the six-party talks on North Korea’s nuclear program, which have been defunct since 2009, resume?
In recent months, North Korea has been exploring new diplomatic territory, with high-level officials engaging Europe, Japan, and the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Last week, the DPRK mission to the UN even responded to a highly critical human rights report by acknowledging its labor camps (which it defended as a means of “re-education” and “reform”).
It remains to be seen whether it seeks to engage the rest of the world in a constructive and sustained manner, or whether DPRK officials and diplomats are merely putting a good face forward to divert international attention from their country’s reputation as a nuclear weapons-monger and human-rights violator.
Two days before the North Korean delegation arrived, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK), which is officially part of the Korean Workers Party, denounced the “South Korean puppet forces for seriously violating the North-South joint declarations and pushing North-South ties into the worst catastrophe.”
On the day of the Incheon visit, North Korea’s state news agency continued the bellicose and derogatory language toward South Korea and the US: “Lurking behind this is an ulterior design of the US to [prod more] zealously the South Korean puppet forces into escalating the confrontation with the DPRK in a bid to strain the situation to an extreme pitch and ignite [a] second Korean War.”
And a mere two days before the Incheon visit, the DPRK ambassador to the United Nations said that China, Russia, and North Korea stand ready to restart the six-party talks.
In fact, there is no coordinated action among the three countries; indeed, relations between China and North Korea remain frigid.
Rather, North Korea seems to be posing a non-existent united front in order to put pressure on the US to soften its stance toward the DPRK regarding its nuclear program and human-rights record, and to reconsider economic sanctions against the North.
Seen in this light, the visit to Incheon was a way to persuade Seoul to put pressure on the US to play nice.
Adding to the mixed messages is the symbolic date of October 4, the seventh anniversary of the 2007 declaration on inter-Korean cooperation signed by the late South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun and the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
This could be a positive reminder that the DPRK is seeking to pursue some of the agreements contained in that declaration.
On the other hand, the North could be taking advantage of criticism of South Korean President Park Geun-hye by her opponents on the left for failing to include the October 4 agreement in her five-year plan regarding inter-Korean relations.
Complicating matters further, military theatrics resumed just two days after the friendly visit to Incheon, when a boat from the DPRK crossed the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the Yellow Sea, inciting a ten-minute firefight with South Korean forces.
The North may have wanted to emphasize that its friendliness toward the South should not be interpreted as weakness.
Or perhaps it was attempting to determine whether its overtures had led South Korea to soften its stance toward the DPRK.
(South Korea’s response – 94 machine-gun rounds – was unambiguous.)
In any case, the incursion may signal that the NLL will soon feature on the agenda of inter-Korean talks.
The DPRK’s decision to visit Incheon was highly symbolic, for it was there during the Korean War that US and South Korean troops, following a daring landing led by General Douglas MacArthur, defeated the North Korean People’s Army and pushed it back beyond the 38th parallel.
Whether the recent surprise landing will mark the port city as the starting point of a path to reconciliation and peace on the Peninsula remains to be seen.
BERLIN – In international climate-policy circles, there is broad consensus regarding the target of limiting global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Still, barring a breakthrough in United Nations negotiations in the near future and a reversal in current emissions trends, meeting that two-degree target is well-nigh impossible.
But if world leaders abandon this target, they will have to make a fundamental strategic decision regarding the structure and stringency levels of a new climate goal.
The science-based approach of translating a global temperature cap into precise national emission budgets is politically unfeasible.
Instead, countries with a strong climate-policy agenda should advocate dynamic formulas for setting targets.
The two-degree target is the primary point of reference for today’s climate debate.
A corresponding rise in the global mean temperature is usually seen as the limit beyond which the effects of climate change could become dangerous.
But, contrary to widespread belief, the last assessment report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) did not call for the two-degree target, which, since the mid-1990s, has acted as a catchy symbol and point of orientation for an ambitious but realistic global climate agenda.
The European Union was the primary force pushing for the two-degree target internationally.
Ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit at the end of 2009, the EU succeeded in getting all relevant partners in the negotiations – including even China, India, Russia, and the United States – to commit to the two-degree target.
In the “Copenhagen Accord,” the UN finally recognized the target, though without any binding measures for achieving it.
There is little hope that this will be rectified at the next summit, in Cancún, Mexico next month.
Since the quantities of greenhouse gases emitted thus far will raise temperatures by 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times, major political decisions are needed to ensure compliance with the two-degree target.
Climate science assumes that the global emissions peak must occur within the next several years.
Currently, however, there is little to suggest that a reversal of today’s trends will even be visible on the horizon by then.
So at some point in the near future, a growing number of voices from the climate-science community must definitively reject the possibility of holding to the two-degree target.
When that happens, simply championing a softer target, most probably 2.5 or three degrees, will not suffice.
According to the current paradigm, the global target is defined within scientific categories and understood as an absolute upper limit.
Given this top-down approach, all initial efforts have been focused on creating a global climate treaty, leading to a heavy focus on global negotiations while neglecting concrete de-carbonization efforts by industrialized and industrializing countries.
This has resulted in stalemate, because governments can always blame failure on the inaction of others.
Even the EU has used this argument to justify its refusal to increase its target for greenhouse-gas reduction for 2020 from 20% to 30%, although this would be an equitable burden for Europe to bear on the path towards meeting the two-degree target.
One possibility is to establish “climate neutrality” as a long-term global objective – i.e., work to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero.
Even if this objective were to be initially linked with a broadly defined timescale, it would establish the standard for action according to which all countries would have to be measured.
Within such a framework, ambitious climate-policy actors such as the EU, Switzerland, or Japan would face the task of committing to exacting de-carbonization measures.
They would need to muster evidence that the transition to a low-carbon economy is both technically feasible and profitable, yielding positive effects not only for the climate, but also for energy prices and security of supply.
Success would spur other G-20 countries, acting out of self-interest, to follow in the climate leaders’ footsteps.
To be sure, it would be impossible to predict, under the currently favoured top-down principle, how much temperature increase the world would have to bear.
Given that holding to a strict temperature limit is not a politically viable option, focusing climate policy on flexible benchmarks such as “climate neutrality” would be more effective over the short term and more promising over the long term.
BOSTON – As we learn more about the threat from substandard and counterfeit medicines, it is becoming clear that it is a far greater problem than previously thought.
It is also a scourge that is most acutely felt in developing countries, where fake and low-quality pharmaceuticals kill more than 500,000 people a year and affect millions more by contributing to the emergence of diseases that are resistant to existing treatments.
Compounding the problem is the approach taken by policymakers in the developing world, who are far more likely to look for solutions abroad than at home.
This shortsightedness is a grave mistake that impedes innovation and progress.
When it comes to tackling high-impact health challenges like the proliferation of fake or inferior drugs, local solutions and local innovations are not only likely to be central to any successful effort; they have the potential to provide benefits that go far beyond the scope of the original problem.
Throughout the developing world, but most evidently in Africa, two groups are interested in finding tools to combat the menace of bad drugs.
One group, comprising students, entrepreneurs, and researchers, seeks solutions that are local, original, and tailored to the needs of their societies.
While this group has produced some innovative solutions – for example, the Ghanaian entrepreneur Bright Simmons is using mobile technology to address the counterfeit-drug problem – many more passionate local inventors and entrepreneurs must get involved.
They, too, are deeply concerned about the scourge of low-quality and fake drugs, but they are reluctant to rely on local innovation.
In their minds, the solutions already exist, in the form of high-end technology designed and developed in the world’s richest countries.
The challenge, for this group, lies in finding the financial resources to import these technologies.
For developing-country leaders, the effort needed to create an ecosystem that supports innovation simply appears too great, and the return on investment too little.
At countless conferences and symposia, ministry officials and government personnel insist that funds must be found to import solutions, à la carte.
Research and innovation, or engagement with local entrepreneurs and inventors, is, unfortunately, never on the agenda.
There simply is little interest in tapping into the enormous pool of intellect, passion, and energy at home.
Raising funds to import solutions from abroad addresses just one part of the challenge.
Many countries lack the resources to install, operate, and maintain equipment that has not been designed locally.
As misuse and neglect causes equipment to malfunction, more funds become required or the program simply dies.
Not only does this approach fail to nurture local ecosystems of innovation, which is deeply frustrating; it also fails – repeatedly – to solve the problem at hand.
While some solutions in the area of drug-quality testing have come from African entrepreneurs like Simmons, such examples are extremely rare, and many are developed in the diaspora with the support of organizations from outside the region.
Indeed, by nurturing an inclusive culture of research, local innovation has the potential to provide benefits that extend far beyond the specific problem that is being addressed.
Nurturing the participation of underrepresented groups and creating opportunities for education and learning not only creates goodwill and promotes transparency and accountability.
Building a stable foundation for future research also enables more productive public-private partnerships and stronger links between academia and domestic industry, thereby promoting economic growth.
Foreign organizations, such as aid agencies or pharmaceutical companies, do have a role to play in boosting local innovation.
They can support it financially, create new partnerships, and encourage policymakers to give it more credence.
This year, the United Nations will adopt the Sustainable Development Goals, marking the start of the next phase of global efforts to eradicate poverty and improve health.
As the example of developing countries’ ongoing fight against counterfeit and low-quality medicines shows, success will depend – far more often than not – on local innovation.
A global economy includes not only the free movement of goods and services but, more importantly, the free movement of ideas and capital (everything from direct investments to financial transactions).
Though both gained in importance since WW II’s end, globalization of financial markets accelerated in recent years so that movements in exchange rates, interest rates, and stock prices in various countries are intimately interconnected.
Indeed, the character of the financial markets changed out of all recognition during the 40 years that I have worked in them.
Global integration brought tremendous benefits: the international division of labor, which are so clearly proved by the theory of comparative advantage; dynamic benefits such as economies of scale and the rapid spread of innovations from one country to another, which are less easy to demonstrate by static equilibrium theory; and noneconomic benefits such as the freedom of choice associated with the international movement of goods, capital, and people, and the freedom of thought associated with the international movement of ideas.
But global capitalism is not without problems; we need to understand these better if we want the system to survive.
By focusing on these problems I am not trying to belittle globalization’s benefits.
These benefits, I believe, can be sustained only by deliberate and persistent efforts to correct and contain the system’s deficiencies.
Here is where I am at loggerheads with laissez-faire ideology, which contends that free markets are self-sustaining and that market excesses correct themselves, provided governments or regulators don’t interfere with the self-correcting mechanism.
There are five types of deficiencies in the global capitalist system which I would now like to discuss:
Capital is in a much better position than labor because capital is more mobile.
Moreover, financial capital is better situated in the global system than industrial capital; once a plant exists, moving it is difficult.
To be sure, multinational corporations enjoy flexibility in transfer pricing and can exert pressure at the time they make new investment decisions, but their flexibility doesn’t compare to the freedom enjoyed by international portfolio investors.
There is also an advantage in being at the center of the global economy rather than at the periphery.
All these factors combine to attract capital to the financial center and account for the ever increasing size and importance of financial markets.
During a boom capital flows from the center to the periphery; when confidence is shaken it tends to return to its source.
I have seen many ebbs and flows, booms and busts, and though I fully recognize that international capital markets have become more institutional in character and demonstrate greater resistance, I cannot believe that the present boom will not be followed by a bust until history proves me wrong.
Risks of breakdown are increased because our theoretical understanding of how financial markets operate is fundamentally flawed.
