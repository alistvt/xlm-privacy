Vidaza is used for the treatment of adults with the following diseases, if they cannot have a bone marrow transplant:  myelodysplastic syndromes, a group of conditions where too few blood cells are produced by the bone marrow.
In some cases, myelodysplastic syndromes can lead to the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called myeloid cells).
Vidaza is used in patients with an intermediate to high risk of progressing to AML or death;  chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML, a type of cancer affecting white blood cells called monocytes).
Vidaza is used when the bone marrow consists of 10 to 29% abnormal cells and the bone marrow is not producing large numbers of white blood cells;  AML that has developed from a myelodysplastic syndrome.
Because the number of patients with these diseases is low, the diseases are considered ‘ rare’, and Vidaza was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 6 February 2002 for myelodysplastic syndromes and on 29 November 2007 for AML.
It is given as an injection under the skin of the upper arm, thigh or abdomen (tummy) every day for one week, followed by three weeks with no treatment.

These actions are thought to correct the problems with the maturation and growth of young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill cancerous cells in leukaemia.
Vidaza has been studied in one main study involving 358 adults with intermediate to high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, CMML or AML, who were unlikely to go on to have a bone marrow transplant.
All of the patients also received ‘ best supportive care’ (any medicines or techniques to help patients, such as antibiotics, painkillers and transfusions), with some patients also receiving other anticancer medicines such as cytarabine with or without an anthracycline.
Posology The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline haematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/ m2 of body surface area, injected subcutaneously, daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle).
Patients should be monitored for haematologic response/ toxicity and renal toxicities (see section 4.4); a delay in starting the next cycle or a dose reduction as described below may be necessary.
Dose adjustment due to haematological toxicity Haematological toxicity is defined as the lowest count reached in a given cycle (nadir) if platelets fall below 50.0 x 109/ l and/ or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1 x 109/ l.
If the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets is greater than 50% from that prior to treatment, with no improvement in cell line differentiation, the next cycle of Vidaza therapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered.
If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mmol/ l occur, the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next cycle.
If unexplained elevations in serum creatinine or BUN to ≥ 2-fold above baseline values and above ULN occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next treatment cycle (see section 4.4).
No specific modification to the starting dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment prior to starting treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology laboratory values.
New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened.
Haematological toxicity Treatment with azacitidine is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly during the first 2 cycles (see section 4.8).
After administration of the recommended dose for the first cycle, the dose for subsequent cycles should be reduced or its administration delayed based on nadir counts and haematological response (see section 4.2).
Patients with extensive tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been rarely reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline serum albumin &lt; 30 g/ l.
Renal impairment Renal abnormalities ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death were reported rarely in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
4 unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate (&lt; 20 mmol/ l) or elevations of serum creatinine or BUN occur, the dose should be reduced or administration delayed (see section 4.2).
Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity since azacitidine and/ or its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney (see section 4.2).
Cardiac and pulmonary disease Patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure, clinically unstable cardiac disease or pulmonary disease were excluded from the pivotal clinical study and therefore the safety and efficacy of Vidaza in these patients has not been established.
Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, azacitidine should not be used during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary.
The most common serious adverse reactions (&gt; 2%) noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) and also reported in the supporting studies (CALGB 9221 and CALGB 8921) included febrile neutropenia (8.0%) and anaemia (2.3%).
Other less frequently reported serious adverse reactions (&lt; 2%) included neutropenic sepsis, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events (e. g. cerebral haemorrhage).
injection site: bruising, haematoma, induration, rash, pruritus, inflammation, discoloration, nodule and haemorrhage. malaise
Haematologic adverse reactions The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment were haematological including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia, and were usually Grade 3 or 4.
There is a greater risk of these events occurring during the first 2 cycles, after which they occur with less frequency in patients with restoration of haematological function.
Most haematological adverse reactions were managed by routine monitoring of complete blood counts and delaying azacitidine administration in the next cycle, prophylactic antibiotics and/ or growth factor support (e. g.
Serious adverse reactions such as neutropenic sepsis (0.8%) and pneumonia (2.5%) were reported in patients receiving azacitidine.
Serious adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal haemorrhage (0.8%) and intracranial haemorrhage (0.5%) have been reported.
None of these adverse reactions led to temporary or permanent discontinuation of azacitidine, or reduction of azacitidine dose in the pivotal study.
Subcutaneous adverse reactions such as injection site rash/ inflammation/ pruritus, rash, erythema and skin lesion may require management with concomitant medicinal products, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions The most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment included constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
These adverse reactions were managed symptomatically with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting; antidiarrhoeals for diarrhoea, and laxatives and/ or stool softeners for constipation.
A patient experienced diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/ m2, almost 4 times the recommended starting dose.
Mechanism of action Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by multiple mechanisms including cytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA.
The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, incorporation into RNA and DNA, and activation of DNA damage pathways.
DNA hypomethylation of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle regulation, differentiation and death pathways may result in gene re-expression and restoration of cancer- suppressing functions to cancer cells.
CCR consisted of BSC alone (n = 105), low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n = 49) or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC (n = 25).
Vidaza was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 75 mg/ m2 daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle) for a median of 9 cycles
The two-year survival rates were 50.8% in patients receiving azacitidine versus 26.2% in patients receiving CCR (p &lt; 0.0001).
The survival benefits of Vidaza were consistent regardless of the CCR treatment option (BSC alone, low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC) utilised in the control arm.
When IPSS cytogenetic subgroups were analysed, similar findings in terms of median overall survival were observed in all groups (good, intermediate, poor cytogenetics, including monosomy 7).
Vidaza treatment was associated with a median time to death or transformation to AML of 13.0 months versus 7.6 months for those receiving CCR treatment, an improvement of 5.4 months with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0025.
In patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months in the azacitidine group.
Overall response (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) as determined by the investigator was 29% in the azacitidine group and 12% in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0001).
Overall response (CR + PR) as determined by the IRC in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was 7% (12/ 179) in the azacitidine group compared with 1% (2/ 179) in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0113).
The differences between the IRC and investigator assessments of response were a consequence of the International Working Group (IWG) criteria requiring improvement in peripheral blood counts and maintenance of these improvements for a minimum of 56 days.
Haematological improvement (major or minor) as determined by the IRC was achieved in 49% of patients receiving azacitidine compared with 29% of patients treated with combined CCR (p &lt; 0.0001).
In patients with one or more cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline, the percentage of patients with a major cytogenetic response was similar in the azacitidine and combined CCR groups.
Minor cytogenetic response was statistically significantly (p = 0.0015) higher in the azacitidine group (34%) compared with the combined CCR group (10%).
Absorption Azacitidine was rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous administration with peak plasma azacitidine concentrations of 750 ± 403 ng/ ml occurring at 0.5 h (the first sampling point) after dosing.
The absolute bioavailability of azacitidine after subcutaneous relative to intravenous administration was approximately 89% based on area under the curve (AUC).
Excretion Azacitidine is cleared rapidly from plasma with a mean elimination half-life (t½) after subcutaneous administration of 41 ± 8 minutes.
Following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 14C-azacitidine, 50-85% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine, while &lt; 1% was recovered in faeces.
10 Special populations The effects of renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2), gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been formally studied.
Azacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice, when administered intraperitoneally 3 times per week for 52 weeks.
An increased incidence of tumours in the lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine administered intraperitoneally for 50 weeks.
Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death (increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis.
CNS anomalies (exencephaly/ encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, oedema, and rib abnormalities).
Administration of azacitidine to male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development.
Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm counts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in mated females (see section 4.4).
Chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted medicinal product has been demonstrated at 25°C for 45 minutes and at 2°C to 8°C for 8 hours.
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and must not be longer than 8 hours at 2°C to 8°C.
Recommendations for safe handling Vidaza is a cytotoxic medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised when handling and preparing azacitidine suspensions.
Vial(s) of azacitidine; vial(s) of water for injections; nonsterile surgical gloves; Alcohol wipes; 5 ml injection syringe(s) with needle(s).
The needle of the syringe containing the 4 ml of water for injections should be inserted through the rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into the vial.
The plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required for the proper dose, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe.
For doses greater than 100 mg (4 ml), the dose should be equally divided into 2 syringes (e.g, dose 150 mg = 6 ml, 2 syringes with 3 ml in each syringe).
Alternatively, if the product needs to be reconstituted in advance of the administration, it must be placed in a refrigerator (2°C to 12 8°C) immediately after reconstitution, and kept in the refrigerator for a maximum of 8 hours.
The following table is provided only as an example of how to calculate individual azacitidine doses based on an average BSA value of 1.8 m2.
Reconstituted Vidaza should be injected subcutaneously (insert the needle at a 45-90o angle) using a 25-gauge needle into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.

It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
It blocks the activity of a human enzyme called renin, which is involved in the production of a substance, angiotensin I, in the body.
This causes vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels), so that the blood pressure drops and the potential risk of damage caused by high blood pressure may be reduced.
The studies lasted between six and 52 weeks and the main measure of effectiveness was the change in blood pressure during either the resting phase of the heartbeat (diastolic) or when the chambers of the heart are contracting (systolic).
The studies also showed that Enviage, when taken in combination with other medicines (especially hydrochlorothiazide), can produce additional decreases in blood pressure compared with those produced by these medicines taken without Enviage.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that the benefits of Enviage are greater than its risks for the treatment of essential hypertension.

Paediatric patients (below 18 years) Enviage is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).
The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin, a highly potent P-gp inhibitor, and other potent P- gp inhibitors (quinidine, verapamil), is contraindicated (see section 4.5).
Patients receiving other medicinal products inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and/ or those with reduced kidney function and/ or diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of hyperkalaemia during aliskiren therapy.
Sodium and/ or volume depleted patients In patients with marked volume- and/ or salt-depletion (e. g. those receiving high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Enviage.
Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Enviage in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney.
Moderate P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of aliskiren 300 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg resulted in a 76% increase in aliskiren AUC but P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma concentrations.
Compounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, atenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate, ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide.
Co-administration of aliskiren with either valsartan (↓ 28%), metformin (↓ 28%), amlodipine (↑ 29%) or cimetidine (↑ 19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of Enviage.
Co- administration of Enviage had no significant impact on atorvastatin, valsartan, metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics.
CYP450 interactions Aliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A).
Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp can therefore be expected (see P-glycoprotein interactions below).
P-glycoprotein interactions MDR1/ Mdr1a/ 1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and biliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies.
Although this has not been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios.
Moderate P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in an 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren (AUC and Cmax).
Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole or other moderate pgp inhibitors (itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone).
P-gp potent inhibitors A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold.
Furosemide When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by 28% and 49% respectively.
It is therefore recommended that the effects be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide therapy to avoid possible under-utilisation in clinical situations of volume overload.
Potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics Based on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing
As for any medicine that acts directly on the RAS, Enviage should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant and is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3).
However, when driving vehicles or operating machinery it must be borne in mind that dizziness or weariness may occasionally occur when taking any antihypertensive therapy.
Enviage has been evaluated for safety in more than 7,800 patients, including over 2,300 treated for over 6 months, and more than 1,200 for over 1 year.
In the event of any signs suggesting an allergic reaction (in particular difficulties in breathing, or swallowing, or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/ or tongue) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician.
In clinical studies in hypertensive patients, Enviage had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose or uric acid.
Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.05 mmol/ l and 0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed.
This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin- angiotensin system, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers.
Increases in serum potassium were minor and infrequent in patients with essential hypertension treated with Enviage alone (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo).
However, in one study where Enviage was used in combination with an ACEI in a diabetic population, increases in serum potassium were more frequent (5.5%).
Therefore as with any agent acting on the RAS system, routine monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is indicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, or heart failure.
By inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAS at the point of activation, blocking the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin II.
Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAS (ACEI and angiotension II receptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin activity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 to 80%.
Compared to a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide - HCTZ), Enviage 300 mg lowered systolic/ diastolic blood pressure by 17.0/ 12.3 mmHg, compared to 14.4/ 10.5 mmHg for HCTZ 25 mg after 12 weeks of treatment.
Combination therapy studies are available for Enviage added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the ACEI ramipril, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan, and the beta blocker atenolol.
Enviage in combination with the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan showed an additive antihypertensive effect in the study specifically designed to investigate the effect of the combination therapy.
In obese hypertensive patients who did not adequately respond to HCTZ 25 mg, add-on treatment with Enviage 300 mg provided additional blood pressure reduction that was comparable to add-on treatment with irbesartan 300 mg or amlodipine 10 mg.
In diabetic hypertensive patients, Enviage provided additive blood pressure reductions when added to ramipril, while the combination of Enviage and ramipril had a lower incidence of cough (1.8%) than ramipril (4.7%).
With cessation of treatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards baseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure or PRA.
In a 3-month study of 302 patients with mild stable heart failure, all of whom were receiving standard therapy for stable heart failure, addition of Enviage 150 mg was well tolerated.
The proportion of patients who had UACR reduced at least 50% from baseline to endpoint was 24.7% and 12.5% for Enviage and placebo, respectively.
Cardiac electrophysiology No effect on QT interval was reported in a randomised, double-blind, placebo, and active-controlled study using standard and Holter electrocardiography.
Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days following once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with the initial dose.
Distribution Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space.
After single dose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and 2.6- fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively.
Characteristics in patients Aliskiren is an effective once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult patients, regardless of gender, age, body mass index and ethnicity.
Relative AUC and Cmax of aliskiren in subjects with renal impairment ranged between 0.8 to 2 times the levels in healthy subjects following single dose administration and at steady state.
No adjustment of the initial dosage of Enviage is required in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment.
One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the dose of 1,500 mg/ kg/ day were not statistically significant.
Reproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or teratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/ kg/ day in rats or 100 mg/ kg/ day in rabbits.
The doses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than the maximum recommended human dose (300 mg).

For patients who are unable to swallow tablets, tablets may be crushed and added to a small amount of semi-solid food or liquid, all of which should be consumed immediately (see section 5.2).
Children weighing between 21 kg and 30 kg: the recommended oral dose of COMBIVIR is one-half tablet taken in the morning and one whole tablet taken in the evening.
The dosing regimen for paediatric patients weighing 14-30 kg is based primarily on pharmacokinetic modelling and supported by data from clinical studies using the individual components lamivudine and zidovudine.
If gastrointestinal intolerance occurs in patients weighing 21-30 kg, an alternative dosing schedule with one-half tablet taken thrice daily can be applied in attempt to improve tolerability.
2 For situations where discontinuation of therapy with one of the active substances of Combivir, or dose reduction is necessary separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine are available in tablets/ capsules and oral solution.
Therefore as dosage adjustment of these may be necessary it is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine be administered to patients with reduced renal function (creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/ min).
Limited data in patients with cirrhosis suggest that accumulation of zidovudine may occur in patients with hepatic impairment because of decreased glucuronidation.
However, as dosage adjustments for zidovudine may be necessary, it is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine be administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Dosage adjustment of zidovudine may be necessary if the haemoglobin level falls below 9 g/ dl or 5.59 mmol/ l or the neutrophil count falls below 1.0 x 109/ l (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
No specific data are available, however special care is advised in this age group due to age associated changes such as the decrease in renal function and alteration of haematological parameters.
Zidovudine is contraindicated in patients with abnormally low neutrophil counts (&lt; 0.75 x 109/ l), or abnormally low haemoglobin levels (&lt; 7.5 g/ dl or 4.65 mmol/ l).
It is recommended that separate preparations of lamivudine and zidovudine should be administered in cases where dosage adjustment is necessary (see section 4.2).
Patients should be advised that current antiretroviral therapy, including Combivir, has not been proven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.
These occurred more frequently at higher zidovudine dosages (1200-1500 mg/ day) and in patients with poor bone marrow reserve prior to treatment, particularly with advanced HIV disease.
For patients with advanced symptomatic HIV disease, it is generally recommended that blood tests are performed at least every two weeks for the first three months of therapy and at least monthly thereafter.
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues.
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and metabolic/ lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.
Caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogues to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol).
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV-negative children, should have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhibitors (PIs) and lipoatrophy and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has been hypothesised.
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/ or focal mycobacterium infections, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia).
If lamivudine is being used concomitantly for the treatment of HIV and HBV, additional information relating to the use of lamivudine in the treatment of hepatitis B infection is available in the Zeffix SPC.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.
If Combivir is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus, periodic monitoring of both liver function tests and markers of HBV replication for 4 months is recommended, as withdrawal of lamivudine may result in an acute exacerbation of hepatitis.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy, and should be monitored according to standard practice.
5 Lamivudine and zidovudine metabolism do not involve CYP3A, making interactions with medicinal products metabolised by this system (e. g.
The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently with Combivir should be considered, particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion, especially via the cationic transport system e. g. trimethoprim.
Nucleoside analogues (e. g. zidovudine, didanosine and zalcitabine) and other medicinal products (e. g. ranitidine, cimetidine) are eliminated only in part by this mechanism and were shown not to interact with lamivudine.
Administration of trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/ 800 mg results in a 40% increase in lamivudine exposure, because of the trimethoprim component; the sulfamethoxazole component does not interact.
Co-administration of Combivir with high doses of co-trimoxazole for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [PCP]) and toxoplasmosis should be avoided.
Limited data suggest that co-administration of zidovudine and rifampicin decreases the AUC of zidovudine by 48% ± 34%.
Limited data suggest that probenecid increases the mean half-life and area under the plasma concentration curve of zidovudine by decreasing glucuronidation.
Phenytoin blood levels have been reported to be low in some patients receiving zidovudine, while in one patient a high level was noted.
In a pharmacokinetic study co-administration of zidovudine and atovaquone tablets showed a decrease in zidovudine clearance after oral dosing leading to a 35% ± 23% increase in plasma zidovudine AUC.
The mode of interaction is unknown and as higher concentrations of atovaquone can be achieved with atovaquone suspension it is possible that greater changes in AUC values for zidovudine might be induced when atovaquone is administered as a suspension.
Valproic acid, fluconazole or methadone when co-administered with zidovudine have been shown to increase the AUC of zidovudine, with a corresponding decrease in its clearance.
If zidovudine is used concurrently with either valproic acid, fluconazole or methadone, patients should be monitored closely for potential toxicity of zidovudine.
Zidovudine and stavudine in combination are antagonistic in vitro, therefore the concomitant use of stavudine with Combivir should be avoided (see section 4.4).
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.
If concomitant therapy with Combivir and any of these medicinal products is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.
No data are available for the treatment with a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine in humans or animals (see also section 5.3).
The use in pregnant women of zidovudine alone, with subsequent treatment of the newborn infants, has been shown to reduce the rate of maternal-foetal transmission of HIV.
In humans, consistent with passive transmission of lamivudine across the placenta, lamivudine concentrations in infant serum at birth were similar to those in maternal and cord serum at delivery.
As the active ingredients of Combivir may inhibit cellular DNA replication, any use, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy, presents a potential risk to the foetus.
Pregnant women considering using Combivir during pregnancy should be made aware of the findings from animal carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies (see section 5.3).
7 lamivudine, zidovudine, the wide range of medicinal products used in the management of HIV disease, or as a result of the underlying disease process.
Cases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to &lt; 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to &lt; 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to &lt; 1/ 1000), very rare (&lt; 1/ 10,000).
These occurred more frequently at higher dosages (1200-1500 mg/ day) and in patients with advanced HIV disease (especially when there is poor bone marrow reserve prior to treatment), and particularly in patients with CD4 cell counts less than 100/ mm3 (see section 4.4).
The incidence of neutropenia was also increased in those patients whose neutrophil counts, haemoglobin levels and serum vitamin B12 levels were low at the start of zidovudine therapy.
The available data from both placebo-controlled and open-label studies indicate that the incidence of nausea and other frequently reported clinical adverse events consistently decreases over time during the first few weeks of therapy with zidovudine.
Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous haemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdosage, although this has not been studied.
Haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis appear to have a limited effect on elimination of zidovudine, but enhance the elimination of the glucuronide metabolite.
Both medicinal products are metabolised intracellularly to their active moieties, lamivudine 5’ -triphosphate (TP) and zidovudine 5’ -TP respectively.
Lamivudine-TP and zidovudine-TP have selective inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in vitro; lamivudine is also active against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV.
HIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the active site of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT).
In vitro data tend to suggest that the continuation of lamivudine in anti-retroviral regimen despite the development of M184V might provide residual anti-retroviral activity (likely through impaired viral fitness).
The M184V RT mutant shows a &lt; 4-fold decrease in susceptibility to didanosine and zalcitabine; the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.
Lamivudine demonstrates low cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes, to established lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines, and to a variety of bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro.
Resistance to thymidine analogues (of which zidovudine is one) is well characterised and is conferred by the stepwise accumulation of up to six specific mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase at codons 41, 67, 70, 210, 215 and 219.
Viruses acquire phenotypic resistance to thymidine analogues through the combination of mutations at codons 41 and 215 or by the accumulation of at least four of the six mutations.
These thymidine analogue mutations alone do not cause high-level cross-resistance to any of the other nucleosides, allowing for the subsequent use of any of the other approved reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
Clinical end-point data indicate that lamivudine in combination with zidovudine, results in a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression and mortality.
Lamivudine and zidovudine have been widely used as components of antiretroviral combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents of the same class (NRTIs) or different classes (PIs, non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).
Multiple drug antiretroviral therapy containing lamivudine has been shown to be effective in antiretrovirally-naive patients as well as in patients presenting with viruses containing the M184V mutations.
Evidence from clinical studies shows that lamivudine plus zidovudine delays the emergence of zidovudine resistant isolates in individuals with no prior antiretroviral therapy.
11 The relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HIV to lamivudine and zidovudine and clinical response to lamivudine/ zidovudine containing therapy remains under investigation.
Lamivudine at a dose of 100 mg once daily has also been shown to be effective for the treatment of adult patients with chronic HBV infection (for details of clinical studies, see the prescribing information for Zeffix).
However, for the treatment of HIV infection only a 300 mg daily dose of lamivudine (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) has been shown to be efficacious.
Combivir was shown to be bioequivalent to lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg given as separate tablets, when administered to fasting subjects.
The median (range) lamivudine and zidovudine tmax values were 0.75 (0.50-2.00) hours and 0.50 (0.25- 2.00) hours respectively.
The extent of lamivudine and zidovudine absorption (AUC∞) and estimates of half-life following administration of Combivir with food were similar when compared to fasting subjects, although the rates of absorption (Cmax, tmax) were slowed.
Administration of crushed tablets with a small amount of semi-solid food or liquid would not be expected to have an impact on the pharmaceutical quality, and would therefore not be expected to alter the clinical effect.
This conclusion is based on the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic data assuming that the patient crushes and transfers 100% of the tablet and ingests immediately.
Intravenous studies with lamivudine and zidovudine showed that the mean apparent volume of distribution is 1.3 and 1.6 l/ kg respectively.
Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited binding to the major plasma protein albumin (&lt; 36% serum albumin in vitro).
Data show that lamivudine and zidovudine penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
The mean ratios of CSF/ serum lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations 2-4 hours after oral administration were approximately 0.12 and 0.5 respectively.
The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with lamivudine is low due to the small extent of hepatic metabolism (5-10%) and low plasma binding.
The 5’ -glucuronide of zidovudine is the major metabolite in both plasma and urine, accounting for approximately 50– 80% of the administered dose eliminated by renal excretion.
3’ -amino-3’ - deoxythymidine (AMT) has been identified as a metabolite of zidovudine following intravenous dosing.
From studies with intravenous zidovudine, the mean terminal plasma half-life was 1.1 hours and the mean systemic clearance was 1.6 l/ h/ kg.
Renal clearance of zidovudine is estimated to be 0.34 l/ h/ kg, indicating glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion by the kidneys.
Zidovudine is well absorbed from the gut and at all dose levels studied in adults and children, the bioavailability was between 60-74% with a mean of 65%.
Cssmax levels were 4.45 μ M (1.19 μ g/ ml) following a dose of 120 mg zidovudine (in solution)/ m2 body surface area and 7.7 μ M (2.06 μ g/ ml) at 180 mg/ m2 body surface area.
Dosages of 180 mg/ m2 four times daily in children produced similar systemic exposure (24 hour AUC 40.0 h μ M or 10.7 h μ g/ ml) as doses of 200 mg six times daily in adults (40.7 h μ M or 10.9 h μ g/ ml).
In six HIV-infected children from 2 to 13 years of age, zidovudine plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated while subjects were receiving 120 mg/ m2 zidovudine three times daily and again after switching to 180 mg/ m2 twice daily.
Systemic exposures (daily AUC and Cmax) in plasma from the twice daily regimen appeared equivalent to those from the same total daily dose given in three divided doses [Bergshoeff, 2004].
Due to these differences, the recommended dose for lamivudine in children (aged more than three months and weighing less than 30 kg) is 4 mg/ kg twice a day.
Neither lamivudine nor zidovudine are mutagenic in bacterial tests, but like many nucleoside analogues they show activity in in vitro mammalian tests such as the mouse lymphoma assay.
Lamivudine has not shown any genotoxic activity in in vivo studies at doses that gave plasma concentrations up to 40-50 times higher than clinical plasma levels.
A pilot study has demonstrated that zidovudine is incorporated into leukocyte nuclear DNA of adults, including pregnant women, taking zidovudine as treatment for HIV-1 infection, or for the prevention of mother to child viral transmission.
A transplacental genotoxicity study conducted in monkeys compared zidovudine alone with the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine at human- 13 equivalent exposures.
The study demonstrated that foetuses exposed in utero to the combination sustained a higher level of nucleoside analogue-DNA incorporation into multiple foetal organs, and showed evidence of more telomere shortening than in those exposed to zidovudine alone.
A subsequent intravaginal carcinogenicity study confirmed the hypothesis that the vaginal tumours were the result of long term local exposure of the rodent vaginal epithelium to high concentrations of unmetabolised zidovudine in urine.
In one study, by the US National Cancer Institute, zidovudine was administered at maximum tolerated doses to pregnant mice from day 12 to 18 of gestation.
One year post-natally, there was an increase in the incidence of tumours in the lung, liver and female reproductive tract of offspring exposed to the highest dose level (420 mg/ kg term body weight).
In a second study, mice were administered zidovudine at doses up to 40 mg/ kg for 24 months, with exposure beginning prenatally on gestation day 10.
Treatment related findings were limited to late- occurring vaginal epithelial tumours, which were seen with a similar incidence and time of onset as in the standard oral carcinogenicity study.
It is concluded that as the increase in incidence of tumours in the first transplacental carcinogenicity study represents a hypothetical risk, this should be balanced against the proven therapeutic benefit.
In reproductive toxicity studies lamivudine has demonstrated evidence of causing an increase in early embryonic deaths in the rabbit at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in man, but not in the rat even at very high systemic exposure.
At maternally toxic doses, zidovudine given to rats during organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of malformations, but no evidence of foetal abnormalities was observed at lower doses.

Pharmacovigilance System The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version 6.2 presented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.
Combivir belongs to a group of antiviral medicines, also known as antiretrovirals, called nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
Discuss the use of Combivir with your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease to ensure the doses of the active substances in Combivir are suitable for you.
29 Anaemia (low red blood cell count) and neutropenia/ leucopenia (low white blood cell count) may occur within 4-6 weeks due to treatment with zidovudine, one of the active substances in Combivir.
Deep, rapid breathing, drowsiness, and non specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, might indicate the development of lactic acidosis.
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started.
It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’ s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for monitoring of liver function.
Treatment with Combivir has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others by unprotected sexual contact or by blood transfer (for example, blood transfusions or sharing needles).
Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.
Combivir should not be taken with high doses of co-trimoxazole, or injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet, as lamivudine, one of the active substances in Combivir may interact with these.
Combivir should also not be taken with stavudine, as zidovudine the other active substance in Combivir may reduce the action of this medicinal product.
If you become pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, you must contact your doctor to discuss the potential adverse effects and the benefits and risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child.
In children whose mothers took nucleoside and nucleotide analogues during pregnancy, the benefit from the reduced chance of being infected with HIV is greater than the risk of suffering from side effects.
For children weighing between 21 kg and 30 kg the recommended oral dose of Combivir is one-half tablet taken in the morning and one whole tablet taken in the evening.
For children weighing less than 14 kg, lamivudine and zidovudine should be taken as separate formulations according to the prescribed dosing for these products.
31 If your doctor wishes to reduce your dose of Combivir, for example if you have kidney problems, then your medicine may be changed to lamivudine and zidovudine taken as separate medicines, which are available as tablets or liquid.
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the undesirable effects that occur are caused by Combivir, by other medicines you are taking at the same time or by the HIV disease.
These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen (belly), and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck (‘ buffalo hump’).
Combination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, hyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin.
Vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhoea, increase in certain liver enzymes, joint pain, muscle pain and other muscle disorders, dizziness, tiredness, difficulty sleeping, hair loss, anaemia (low red blood cell count) and neutropenia (low white blood cell count).
If the number of red blood cells is reduced you may have symptoms of tiredness or breathlessness and a reduction in your white blood cell count can make you more prone to infection.
Flatulence, breathlessness, rash (red, raised or itchy), fever, general aches and pains and reduction in platelets (blood cells important for blood clotting).
32 While many of the side effects that have been reported occur with both lamivudine and zidovudine when given as separate medicines, some are more likely to occur with one of the medicines only.
The other ingredients are: - tablet core; microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycollate (gluten free), magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide - tablet film-coat; hypromellose, titanium dioxide, macrogol 400 and polysorbate 80.

It is used in combination with at least one other antiviral medicine to treat patients who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The tablets should ideally be swallowed without crushing, although patients who cannot swallow tablets may crush and add them to a small amount of food or drink, before taking the dose immediately.
If patients need to stop taking lamivudine or zidovudine, or need to take different doses because of problems with their kidneys, liver or blood, they will need to take medicines containing lamivudine or zidovudine separately.

Because zidovudine has been available in the European Union (EU) since the mid-1980s, and lamivudine has been approved in the EU since 1996 as Epivir, the company presented information obtained in earlier studies of the two substances taken together.
The company also compared the combination tablet to separate tablets of lamivudine and zidovudine in 75 adults and adolescents who had not taken treatment for HIV infection before.
The main measures of effectiveness were the change in the level of HIV in the blood (viral load) and the change in the number of CD4 T-cells in the blood (CD4 cell count) after 12 weeks of treatment.
In order to support its recommendations for Combivir doses in children, the company presented information from studies of the levels of lamivudine and zidovudine in the blood of children taking the medicines separately.
The earlier studies showed that the active substances, lamivudine and zidovudine, taken together could reduce viral loads and allow CD4 cell counts to rise after up to one year of treatment.
Combivir should not be used by people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to lamivudine, zidovudine or any of the other ingredients.
Because it contains zidovudine, it should also not be used by patients with low neutrophil counts (a type of white blood cell) or anaemia (low red blood cell counts).
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Combivir may be at risk of developing lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
As with all other NRTIs, Combivir may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Combivir during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Combivir’ s benefits are greater than its risks in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infection.
The patients more likely to benefit from a treatment with INTEGRILIN are those who have had acute angina and may have a special type of surgery to clear up the arteries to the heart (percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography, or PTCA).
This is followed by a continuous infusion (drip into a vein) of 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min for up to 72 hours, until the start of surgery, or until discharge from the hospital (whichever occurs first).
When the patient undergoes a percutaneous coronary intervention, then the treatment can be continued for up to 20-24 hours after surgery, to a maximum of 96 hours.
Eptifibatide, the active substance in INTEGRILIN, stops the platelets aggregating by blocking the special protein on their surface that contributes to making them sticky (glycoprotein IIb/ III).
The effectiveness of INTEGRILIN was studied in a large clinical trial, PURSUIT (11,000 patients), where INTEGRILIN was compared with placebo (dummy treatment) in hospital patients who had signs that they may soon develop a heart attack, or who already had a small heart attack.
Another study, ESPRIT, compared INTEGRILIN with a placebo in 2,000 patients who were having PTCA to remove a blood clot from the coronary arteries and insert a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to stop it closing).
In the PURSUIT trial, INTEGRILIN was more effective than placebo in preventing death or further heart attacks during the 30 days after it was given.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that INTEGRILIN’ s benefits are greater than its risks to prevent early myocardial infarction.
INTEGRILIN is indicated for the prevention of early myocardial infarction in patients presenting with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with the last episode of chest pain occurring within 24 hours and with ECG changes and/ or elevated cardiac enzymes.
If Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is performed during eptifibatide therapy, continue the infusion for 20-24 hours post-PCI for an overall maximum duration of therapy of 96 hours.
Emergency or semi-elective surgery If the patient requires emergency or urgent cardiac surgery during the course of eptifibatide therapy, terminate the infusion immediately.
If the patient requires semi-elective surgery, stop the eptifibatide infusion at an appropriate time to allow time for platelet function to return towards normal.
Renal impairment In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 - &lt; 50 ml/ min), an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram/ kg should be administered followed by a continuous infusion dose of 1.0 microgram/ kg/ min for the duration of therapy.
Bleeding INTEGRILIN is an antithrombotic agent that acts by inhibition of platelet aggregation; therefore the patient must be observed carefully for indications of bleeding during treatment (see section 4.8).
All potential bleeding sites, e. g., catheter insertion sites; arterial, venous, or needle puncture sites; cutdown sites; gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts must be observed carefully.
3 There is limited therapeutic experience with INTEGRILIN in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is generally indicated (e. g., acute transmural myocardial infarction with new pathological Q-waves or elevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG).
Stop the INTEGRILIN infusion immediately if circumstances arise that necessitate thrombolytic therapy or if the patient must undergo an emergency CABG surgery or requires an intraortic balloon pump.
If serious bleeding occurs that is not controllable with pressure, immediately stop the INTEGRILIN infusion and any unfractionated heparin that is given concomitantly.
Arterial procedures During treatment with eptifibatide there is a significant increase in bleeding rates, especially in the femoral artery area, where the catheter sheath is introduced.
Arterial sheaths may be removed when coagulation has returned to normal (e. g., when activated clotting time [ACT] is less than 180 seconds (usually 2-6 hours after discontinuation of heparin).
Thrombocytopaenia, including acute profound thrombocytopaenia, has been observed with eptifibatide administration (see section 4.8).
Platelet counts should be monitored prior to treatment, within 6 hours of administration, and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy and immediately at clinical signs of unexpected bleeding tendency.
If the patient experiences a confirmed platelet decrease to &lt; 100,000/ mm3, discontinue INTEGRILIN and unfractionated heparin and monitor and treat the patient appropriately.
In patients with previous thrombocytopaenia from other parenteral GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitors, there are no data with the use of INTEGRILIN, and thus these patients require close monitoring as noted above.
Heparin administration Heparin administration is recommended unless a contraindication (such as a history of thrombocytopaenia associated with use of heparin) is present.
For a patient who weighs ≥ 70 kg, it is recommended that a bolus dose of 5,000 units is given, followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 1,000 units/ hr.
If the patient weighs &lt; 70 kg, a bolus dose of 60 units/ kg is recommended, followed by an infusion of 12 units/ kg/ hr.
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be monitored in order to maintain a value between 50 and 70 seconds, above 70 seconds there may be an increased risk of bleeding.
If PCI is to be performed in the setting of UA/ NQMI, monitor the activated clotting time (ACT) to maintain a value between 300-350 seconds.
Monitoring of laboratory values Before infusion of INTEGRILIN, the following laboratory tests are recommended before treatment to identify pre-existing haemostatic abnormalities: prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT, serum creatinine, platelet count, haemoglobin and haematocrit levels.
Haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count are to be monitored as well within 6 hours after start of therapy and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy (or more often if there is evidence of a marked decrease).
Immunogenicity Immunogenic response or antibodies against eptifibatide have been observed in isolated cases in naïve patients or in rare cases of patients re-exposed to eptifibatide.
INTEGRILIN did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with concomitant use of warfarin and dipyridamole.
INTEGRILIN-treated patients who had a prothrombin time (PT) &gt; 14.5 seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk of bleeding.
At the highest infusion rates (1.3 microgram/ kg/ min and 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min) studied, eptifibatide was associated with an increased incidence of bleeding and transfusions compared to the incidence seen when streptokinase was given alone.
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
The majority of undesirable effects experienced by patients treated with eptifibatide were generally related to bleeding, or to cardiovascular events that occur frequently in this patient population.
At the recommended therapeutic dose, as administered in the PURSUIT trial involving nearly 11,000 patients, bleeding was the most common complication encountered during eptifibatide therapy.
Administration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding, as classified by the criteria of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) study group.
5 Bleeding Minor bleeding was a very common (&gt; 1/ 10) complication of eptifibatide administration (13.1% eptifibatide vs 7.6% placebo).
Minor bleeding was defined as spontaneous gross haematuria, spontaneous haematemesis, observed blood loss with a haemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g/ dl, or more than 4 g/ dl in the absence of an observed bleeding site.
Bleeding events were more frequent in patients receiving concurrent heparin while undergoing PCI, when ACT exceeded 350 seconds (see section 4.4, heparin use).
Major bleeding was also very common (&gt; 1/ 10) and reported more frequently in patients treated with eptifibatide than with placebo, i. e., 10.8% vs 9.3%, respectively.
Major bleeding was defined as either an intracranial haemorrhage or a decrease in haemoglobin concentrations of more than 5 g/ dl (see table 1).
The incidence of severe or life-threatening bleeding events with eptifibatide was common( &gt; 1/ 100, &lt; 1/ 10); 1.9% vs 1.1% with placebo.
In the subgroup of patients undergoing PCI, major bleeding was observed commonly, in 9.7% of eptifibatide-treated patients vs 4.6% of placebo-treated patients.
Other undesirable effects Overall, in the same trial, serious non-bleeding adverse events were reported at a similar rate in patients treated with eptifibatide and those treated with placebo.
Commonly (&gt; 1/ 100, &lt; 1/ 10) reported events (occurring in ≥ 2% across all groups) in PURSUIT were events related to the underlying disease, such as atrial fibrillation, hypotension, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest and shock.
Patients with unstable angina/ non-Q wave myocardial infarction (NQMI) [PURSUIT trial] received an IV bolus of 180 microgram/ kg followed by continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min for up to 72 hours (96 hours if PCI performed).

Reported Adverse Events in ESPRIT * Very common (&gt; 1/ 10), Common (&gt; 1/ 100 ,&lt; 1/10), Uncommon (&gt; 1/ 1,000 ,&lt; 1/100), Rare (&gt; 1/ 10,000, &lt; 1/ 1,000), Very rare (&lt; 1/ 10,000)
Blood and lymphatic system disorders Very rare: fatal bleeding (the majority involved central and peripheral nervous system disorders: cerebral or intracranial haemorrhages); pulmonary haemorrhage, acute profound thrombocytopaenia, haematoma, anaemia.
No apparent differences were observed between patients treated with eptifibatide or with placebo in values for liver function (SGOT/ AST, SGPT/ ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) or renal function (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen).
In the PURSUIT trial, there were 9 patients who received bolus and/ or infusion doses more than double that specified in the protocol, or who were identified by the investigator as having received an overdose.
Eptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein (GP)IIb/ IIIa receptors.
Eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner as demonstrated by ex vivo platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and other agonists to induce platelet aggregation.
When followed by a 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min continuous infusion, this regimen produces a &gt; 80% inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation, at physiologic calcium concentrations, in more than 80% of patients.
Platelet inhibition was readily reversed, with a return of platelet function towards baseline (&gt; 50% platelet aggregation) 4 hours after stopping a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min.
The pivotal clinical trial for Unstable Angina (UA)/ Non-Q Wave Myocardial Infarction (NQMI) was PURSUIT.
This study was a 726-center, 27-country, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in 10,948 patients presenting with UA or NQMI.
Patients could be enrolled only if they had experienced cardiac ischemia at rest (≥ 10 minutes) within the previous 24 hours and had: • either ST-segment changes:
ST depression &gt; 0.5 mm of less than 30 minutes or persistent ST elevation &gt; 0.5 mm not requiring reperfusion therapy or thrombolytic agents, T-wave inversion (&gt; 1 mm), • or increased CK-MB.
The infusion was continued until hospital discharge, until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or for up to 72 hours, whichever occurred first.
If PCI was performed, the eptifibatide infusion was continued for 24 hours after the procedure, allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 hours.
The 180/ 1.3 arm was stopped after an interim analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, when the two active-treatment arms appeared to have a similar incidence of bleeding.
Patients were managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site; frequencies of angiography, PCI and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country.
Of the patients in PURSUIT, 13% were managed with PCI during eptifibatide infusion, of whom approximately 50% received intracoronary stents; 87% were managed medically (without PCI during eptifibatide infusion).
Unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at the physician’ s discretion, most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 U followed by a continuous infusion of 1,000 U/ h.
11 after randomisation, in which case they received intravenous unfractionated heparin to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) of 300-350 seconds.
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new myocardial infarction (MI) (evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee) within 30 days of randomisation.
Compared to placebo, eptifibatide administered as 180/ 2.0 significantly reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint events (table 4): this represents around 15 events avoided for 1,000 patients treated:
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early during treatment (within the first 72-96 hours) and this reduction was maintained through 6 months, without any significant effect on mortality.
Patients most likely to benefit from eptifibatide treatment are those at high risk of developing myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina.
ESPRIT (Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/ IIIa Receptor with eptifibatide Therapy) was a double- blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (n= 2,064) for nonurgent PCI with intracoronary stenting.
All patients received routine standard of care and were randomised to either placebo or eptifibatide (2 bolus doses of 180 microgram/ kg and a continuous infusion until discharge from hospital or a maximum of 18-24 hours).
The rate of infusion was 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min for patients with serum creatinine ≤ 175 micromols/ l or 1.0 microgram/ kg/ min for serum creatinine &gt; 175 up to 350 micromols/ l.
12 In the eptifibatide arm of the trial, virtually all patients received aspirin (99.7%), and 98.1% received a thienopyridine, (clopidogrel in 95.4% and ticlopidine in 2.7%).
On the day of PCI, prior to catheterization, 53.2% received a thienopyridine (clopidogrel 52.7%; ticlopidine 0.5%) – mostly as a loading dose (300 mg or more).
The ESPRIT trial used a simplified regimen of heparin during PCI that consisted of an initial bolus of 60 units/ kg, with a target ACT of 200 - 300 seconds.
The primary endpoint of the trial was death (D), MI, urgent target vessel revascularisation (UTVR), and acute antithrombotic rescue with GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitor therapy (RT) within 48 hours of randomisation.
For this diagnosis, within 24 hours after the index PCI procedure, there had to be at least two CK-MB values ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal; thus, validation by the CEC was not required.
Results on the primary endpoint were mainly attributed to the reduction of enzymatic MI occurrence, identified as the occurrence of early elevation of cardiac enzymes after PCI (80 out of 92 MIs in the placebo group vs.
Similar results were also obtained for the 2 secondary endpoints assessed at 30 days: a triple composite of death, MI and UTVR, and the more robust combination of death and MI.
Prolongation of bleeding time Administration of eptifibatide by intravenous bolus and infusion causes up to a 5-fold increase in bleeding time.
When administered alone, eptifibatide has no measurable effect on prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 to 250 microgram/ kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3.0 microgram/ kg/ min.
For a 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min infusion, mean steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations range from 1.5 to 2.2 microgram/ ml in patients with coronary artery disease.
In the same population, plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours, plasma clearance 55 to 80 ml/ kg/ hr and volume of distribution of approximately 185 to 260 ml/ kg.
In patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/ min), the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by approximately 50% and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled.
However, in a population pharmacokinetic study there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between eptifibatide and the following concomitant medicinal products: amlodipine, atenolol, atropine, captopril, cefazolin,
Toxicology studies conducted with eptifibatide include single and repeated dose studies in the rat, rabbit and monkey, reproduction studies in the rat and rabbit, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies, and irritation, hypersensitivity and antigenicity studies.
INTEGRILIN is compatible with 0.9% sodium chloride solution for infusion and with Dextrose 5% in Normosol R, in the presence or absence of potassium chloride.
17 There is limited therapeutic experience with INTEGRILIN in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is generally indicated (e. g., acute transmural myocardial infarction with new pathological Q-waves or elevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG).
19 Bleeding Minor bleeding was a very common (&gt; 1/ 10) complication of eptifibatide administration (13.1% eptifibatide vs 7.6% placebo).

INTEGRILIN is compatible with 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection and with Dextrose 5% in Normosol R, in the presence or absence of potassium chloride.
INTEGRILIN is used in patients with manifestation of severe coronary insufficiency defined as spontaneous and recent chest pain with electrocardiographic abnormalities or biological changes.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE CERTAIN TO ASK THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL PHARMACIST.
Taking other medicines To avoid the possibility of interactions with other medicinal products please tell your doctor or hospital pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription..
Pregnancy and breast-feeding The use of INTEGRILIN during pregnancy is recommended only if it is very important for you to have it.
The recommended dose is 180 microgram/ kg administered as a bolus (rapid intravenous injection), followed by an infusion (drip solution) of 2.0 microgram/ kg/ minute for up to 72 hours.
If percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed during INTEGRILIN therapy, the intravenous solution may be continued for up to 96 hours.

Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).
Patients with renal impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 4 ml/ min) (see section 5.2).
Children and adolescents There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group.
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease.
Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease.
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible.
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/ or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.
Weight gain In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention.
Haematology There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% relative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution.
Eye disorders Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with increased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone.
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered.
Others An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3.5 years.
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator.
4 As a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation.
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6).
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors (e. g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e. g. rifampicin).
Glustin tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea.
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes, e. g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone.
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered.
Co-administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone.
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.
Adverse reactions reported in excess (&gt; 0.5%) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency.
Frequencies are defined as: very common &gt; 1/ 10; common &gt; 1/ 100 ,&lt; 1/10; uncommon &gt; 1/1000 ,&lt; 1/100; rare &gt; 1/ 10000 ,&lt; 1/1000; very rare &lt; 1/10000; not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg.
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg.
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents.
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups.
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin.
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than with placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin.
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone, but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure.
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised, comparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration.
8 In the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%) of female patients treated with comparator.
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals.
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first six months of therapy).
At two years, glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of patients on gliclazide.
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year.
In a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months.
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin alone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group.
The effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics.
In clinical trials of up to two years duration, pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL cholesterol levels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide.
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo, whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide.
In a 20-week study, as well as reducing fasting triglycerides, pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides.
In PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre- existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years.
To be eligible patients had to have one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial obstructive disease.
Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, fibrates).
Absorption Following oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration.
10 Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.
Elimination Following oral administration of radiolabeled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in faeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%).
The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours.
Patients with renal impairment In patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is similar.
In toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys.
An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years.
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon.
13 Patients with renal impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 4 ml/ min) (see section 5.2).
Eye disorders Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone.
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation.
15 Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6).
Frequencies are defined as: very common &gt; 1/ 10; common &gt; 1/ 100 ,&lt; 1/10; uncommon &gt; 1/1000 ,&lt; 1/100; rare &gt; 1/ 10000 ,&lt; 1/1000; very rare &lt; 1/10000;
In the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%) of female patients treated with comparator.
In most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels.
20 In PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre- existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years.
To be eligible patients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial obstructive disease.
24 Patients with renal impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 4 ml/ min) (see section 5.2).
26 Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors (e. g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e. g. rifampicin).
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose- related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered.
In PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre- existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to
32 Patients with renal impairment In patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is similar.

Glustin 15 mg tablets helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by helping your body make better use of the insulin it produces.
Glustin 15 mg tablets may be used on their own or in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea which are also oral anti-diabetic medicines.
When Glustin 15 mg tablets are taken in combination with other medicines used to treat diabetes (such as insulin, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide) your doctor will tell you whether you need to take a smaller dose of your medicines.
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with Glustin and insulin experienced the development of heart failure.
Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).

Glustin 30 mg tablets helps control the level of sugar in your blood when you have type 2 diabetes by helping your body make better use of the insulin it produces.
Glustin 30 mg tablets may be used on their own or in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea which are also oral anti-diabetic medicines.
When Glustin 30 mg tablets are taken in combination with other medicines used to treat diabetes (such as insulin, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide) your doctor will tell you whether you need to take a smaller dose of your medicines.
55 Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with Glustin and insulin experienced the development of heart failure.
In clinical trials in which pioglitazone was compared to other oral anti diabetic drugs or placebo (dummy pill), a higher number of bone fractures was seen in women (but not in men) taking pioglitazone.

It can be added to metformin in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin used on its own at the maximum tolerated dose.
In combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, the current sulphonylurea or insulin dose can be continued when starting Glustin treatment unless the patient has hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), when the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin should be decreased.

Pioglitazone, the active ingredient in Glustin, makes the cells more sensitive to insulin, which means that the body makes better use of the insulin it produces, the blood glucose is reduced and this helps to control type 2 diabetes.
In triple therapy, the effectiveness of Glustin was studied in more than 1,400 patients who were receiving a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea, to which was added either Glustin or placebo for up to 3.5 years.
The studies measured the level in the blood of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.
Glustin led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c, indicating that blood glucose levels had been reduced at doses of 15, 30 and 45 mg.
At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of adding Glustin to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonylurea was a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c levels, while adding placebo led to a 0.35% reduction.
In a small study examining the combination of Glustin and insulin in 289 patients, patients adding Glustin to insulin had a 0.69% reduction in HbA1c levels after six months, compared with 0.14% in those adding placebo.
The most common side effects with Glustin are visual disturbance, upper respiratory tract infection (colds), weight increase, and hypoaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to a stimulus).
Glustin should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones [acids] in the blood).
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Glustin’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
In monotherapy (used on its own), the Committee decided that Glustin should be an alternative to the standard treatment, metformin, to be used when patients cannot take metformin.
The recommended dose of Fluticasone Furoate GSK for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over is two sprays in each nostril once a day.
For children between six and 12 years of age, the recommended dose is one spray in each nostril once a day, although this can be increased to two sprays if symptoms are not controlled.
Fluticasone Furoate GSK should only be used for as long as the patient is exposed to the allergen, such as pollen, house dust mites or other animals.
It works in a similar way to naturally-occurring corticosteroid hormones, dampening down the activity of the immune system by attaching to receptors in various types of immune cell.
The effectiveness of Fluticasone Furoate GSK was studied in six main studies involving almost 2,500 patients, which compared Fluticasone Furoate GSK with placebo (a dummy treatment).
Three were short-term studies lasting two weeks and involved a total of 886 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), while the fourth lasted four weeks and involved 302 patients with perennial (non- seasonal) allergies, such as allergies to animal dander (skin and hair).
The last two studies were carried out in children aged between two and 11 years, in which two doses of Fluticasone Furoate GSK were compared with placebo.
In the studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents, Fluticasone Furoate GSK reduced symptom scores from a starting point of around 9 points by between 3.6 and 5.4 points over two weeks, compared with a reduction of 2.3 to 3.7 points with placebo.
In the study of perennial allergic rhinitis, Fluticasone Furoate GSK reduced scores by 3.6 points after four weeks, compared with a reduction of 2.8 points with placebo.
However, it was not possible to determine if Fluticasone Furoate GSK worked in children below the age of six years, because there were too few children below this age included in the studies.
The most common side effect with Fluticasone Furoate GSK (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is epistaxis (nosebleeds).
Fluticasone Furoate GSK should not be used in people who are allergic to fluticasone furoate or any of the other ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Fluticasone Furoate GSK’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients aged six years or over.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Fluticasone Furoate GSK to Glaxo Group Ltd. on 6 October 2008.
However, it may take several days of treatment to achieve maximum benefit, and the patient should be informed that their symptoms will improve with continuous regular use (see section 5.1).
Adults and Adolescents (12 years and over) The recommended starting dose is two spray actuations (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms).
Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril (total daily dose 55 micrograms) may be effective for maintenance.
Children (6 to 11 years of age) The recommended starting dose is one spray actuation (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray actuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms).
Patients not adequately responding to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms) may use two spray actuations in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms).
Once adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms) is recommended.
The device is primed by pressing the mist release button for at least six spray actuations (until a fine mist is seen), whilst holding the device upright.
Re-priming (approximately 6 sprays until a fine mist is seen) is only necessary if the cap is left off for 5 days or the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more.
Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, therefore the systemic exposure of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with severe liver disease is likely to be increased.
Ritonavir Concomitant administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate (see section 4.5).
If there is evidence for higher than recommended doses being used, then additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery.
Fluticasone furoate 110 micrograms once daily was not associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression in adult, adolescent or paediatric subjects.
However the dose of intranasal fluticasone furoate should be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of the symptoms of rhinitis is maintained.
As with all intranasal corticosteroids, the total systemic burden of corticosteroids should be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently.
If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of reducing the dose of nasal corticosteroid if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.
If there is any reason to believe that adrenal function is impaired, care must be taken when transferring patients from systemic steroid treatment to fluticasone furoate.
Based on data with another glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), that is metabolised by CYP3A4, co- administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate.
Caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors as an increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out.
In a drug interaction study of intranasal fluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there were more subjects with measurable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the ketoconazole group (6 of the 20 subjects) compared to placebo (1 out of 20 subjects).
The enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no theoretical basis for anticipating metabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses.
Administration of fluticasone furoate to women who are breastfeeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.
Very common &gt; 1/ 10; Common &gt; 1/ 100 to &lt; 1/10; Uncommon &gt; 1/1000 to&lt; 1/100; Rare &gt; 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/ 1000; Very rare &lt; 1/10,000.
In adults and adolescents, the incidence of epistaxis was higher in longer-term use (more than 6 weeks) than in short-term use (up to 6 weeks).
In paediatric clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration the incidence of epistaxis was similar between patients receiving fluticasone furoate and patients receiving placebo.
Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action.
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray significantly improved the patients’ perception of overall response to therapy, and the patients’ disease-related quality of life (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire – RQLQ), in all 4 studies.
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms as well as patients’ perception of overall response to therapy compared to placebo in both studies.
Fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved ocular symptoms as well as improving patients’ disease-related quality of life (RQLQ) compared to placebo in one study.
In seasonal allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily was effective but no significant differences were observed between fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily and placebo on any endpoint.
In perennial allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily exhibited a more consistent efficacy profile than fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily over 4 weeks’ treatment.
Post-hoc analysis over 6 and 12 weeks in the same study, as well as 6-week HPA axis safety study, supported the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily.
A 6-week study that assessed the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily on adrenal function in children aged 2 to 11 years showed that there was no significant effect on 24-hour serum cortisol profiles, compared with placebo.
Results from a placebo-controlled knemometry study of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily revealed no clinically relevant effects on short-term lower leg growth rate in children (6 to 11 years).
Safety and efficacy studies were performed in a total of 271 patients from 2 to 5 years of age in both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, of whom 176 were exposed to fluticasone furoate.
The absolute bioavailability for intranasal fluticasone furoate is 0.50%, such that less than 1 microgram of fluticasone furoate would be systemically available after administration of 110 micrograms (see section 4.9).
Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared (total plasma clearance of 58.7 l/ h) from systemic circulation principally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17β -carboxylic metabolite (GW694301X), by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4.
The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the S- fluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the 17β -carboxylic acid metabolite.
Elimination was primarily via the faecal route following oral and intravenous administration indicative of excretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile.
In the majority of patients fluticasone furoate is not quantifiable (&lt; 10 pg/ ml) following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily.
Quantifiable levels were observed in 15.1% of paediatric patients following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily and only 6.8% of paediatric patients following 55 micrograms once daily.
Median fluticasone furoate concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels at 55 micrograms were 18.4 pg/ ml and 18.9 pg/ ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively.
At 110 micrograms, median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 14.3 pg/ ml and 14.4 pg/ ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively.
The values are similar to those seen in adults (12+) where median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 15.4 pg/ ml and 21.8 pg/ ml at 55 micrograms and 110 micrograms, respectively.
Less than 1% of dose-related material is excreted in urine and therefore renal impairment would not be expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate.
From this study the average predicted exposure of 110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment would not be expected to result in suppression of cortisol.

Fluticasone furoate GSK nasal spray is used to treat symptoms of allergic rhinitis including stuffy, runny or itchy nose, sneezing and watery, itchy or red eyes, in adults and children aged 6 years and over.
Allergy symptoms can occur at specific times of the year and be caused by allergy to pollen from grass or trees (hayfever), or they can occur all year around and be caused by allergy to animals, house-dust mites or moulds.
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to fluticasone furoate or any of the other ingredients of Fluticasone furoate GSK.
It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken any of the following medicines: • steroid tablets or injected steroids • steroid creams • medicines for asthma • ritonavir, used to treat HIV • ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Do not use Fluticasone furoate GSK if you are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.
How long Fluticasone furoate GSK takes to work Some people will not feel the full effects until several days after first using Fluticasone furoate GSK.
Adults and children 12 years and over • The usual starting dose is 2 sprays in each nostril once every day. • Once symptoms are controlled you may be able to decrease your dose to 1 spray in each nostril, once every day.
Children under 12 years • In children aged 6 to 11 the usual starting dose is 1 spray in each nostril once every day. • If symptoms are very bad your doctor may increase the dose to 2 sprays in each nostril once every day until the symptoms are under control.
It may then be possible for the dose to be reduced to 1 spray in each nostril once every day. • Do not use in children under 6 years old.
If you forget to use Fluticasone furoate GSK • If you miss a dose, take it when you remember. • If it is nearly the time for your next dose, wait until then.
19 How to test the nasal spray before use The nasal spray • Your medicine comes in a glass bottle inside a plastic casing. • The glass bottle contains either 30, 60 or 120 sprays. • A window on the side of the casing allows you to see how much medicine is left.
A bottle containing 30 sprays will not appear full when you first receive it. • The medicine sprays out of the nozzle when the button on the side is firmly pressed. • The nozzle is protected by a removable cap.
Holding the nasal spray upright, point the nozzle away from you and firmly press the button on the side at least 6 times to release a fine spray into the air – see picture b.
If the spray is damaged, if it produces anything other than a fine mist (such as a jet of liquid), or if you feel any disomfort using the spray:
If you forget to use Fluticasone furoate GSK • If you miss a dose take it when you remember. • If it is nearly the time for your next dose, wait until then.
Very common side effects (These can affect more than 1 person in 10) • Nosebleeds (generally minor), particularly if you use Fluticasone furoate GSK for more than 6 weeks continuously.
Common side effects (These can affect less than 1 person in 10 and more than 1 person in 100) • Irritation or discomfort in the inside of the nose – you may also get streaks of blood when you blow your nose.

The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance (e. g. during puberty or due to obesity) and lower in patients with residual, endogenous insulin production.
They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath.
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see sections 4.8 and 4.9).
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy, may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly.
Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (fast-, dual-, long-acting insulin etc.), origin (animal, human or analogue insulin) and/ or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may result in a need for a change in dosage.
3 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin.
Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the physician, since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times.
Oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non-selective beta- blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, alcohol, anabolic steroids and sulphonamides.
Oral contraeptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and danazol.
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero.
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy”, which is usually reversible.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area.
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin.
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver.
This process is influenced by several factors (e. g. insulin dosage, injection route and site, thickness of subcutaneous fat, type of diabetes).
The terminal half-life (t½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes).
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.

A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
However, hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages: • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products.
After removing Mixtard Penfill from the refrigerator it is recommended to allow the Penfill to reach room temperature (not above 25°C) before resuspending the insulin as instructed for first time use.

Look out for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side effects ► If you feel a hypo coming on (a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is a symptom of low blood sugar).
Discuss with your doctor whether you can drive or use machines at all, if you have a lot of hypos or if you find it hard to recognise hypos.
If it isn’ t in perfect condition when you get the vial, return the vial to your supplier ► If it hasn’ t been stored correctly or been frozen (see 6 How to store Mixtard) ► If it’ s not uniformly white and cloudy when it’ s resuspended.
The best places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen); your buttocks; the front of your thighs or upper arms.
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues that if you pass out (become unconscious), they must: turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away.
They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed, dry skin; dry mouth and a fruity (acetone) smell of the breath.
If you inject yourself too often at the same site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy).
If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site.
Seek medical advice immediately: • if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body, or • if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty in breathing; have a rapid heart beat; feel dizzy; feel like fainting.

If there are less than 12 units left, use a new Mixtard 10 NovoLet • Move the pen up and down between positions a and b and back (picture A) so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times.
To avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: • Hold Mixtard 10 NovoLet with the needle pointing upwards • Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times.
Any air bubbles will collect at the top of the cartridge • Keeping the needle upwards, turn the cartridge for one click in the direction of the arrow (picture C) • Still with the needle upwards, press the push-button fully down (picture D) • A drop of insulin must appear at the needle tip.
If the push-button cannot rise freely, some of your insulin will be pushed out of the needle • The scale on the cap shows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 units.
Otherwise, insulin will leak out of the needle and the dose will be incorrect • If you have, by mistake, tried to set a dose over 78 units, follow these steps:
Be careful only to push the push- button when injecting • Keep the push-button fully depressed after the injection until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin.
If not, turn the cap until the push- button is fully depressed, then proceed as described in Getting started • You may hear a clicking sound when you press the push-button.
Don’ t use this to set or check your dose; it may not be accurate • You can’ t set a dose higher than the number of units left in the cartridge • You can use the insulin level indicator to estimate how much is left, but you can’ t use it to set or select your dose.
Health care professionals, relatives and other carers must follow general precautionary measures for removal and disposal of needles to eliminate the risk of unintended needle penetration.

Mixtard is supplied in vials, cartridges (PenFill) or pre-filled pens (NovoLet, FlexPen or InnoLet).
The active substance in Mixtard, insulin human (rDNA), is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant technology’: the insulin is made by a yeast that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce insulin.
Mixtard contains insulin in two forms: the soluble form, which acts quickly (within 30 minutes of injection) and the ‘ isophane’ form which is absorbed much more slowly during the day.
Mixtard has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, when the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, when the body is unable to use insulin effectively.
The study measured the level of a substance in the blood called glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks, which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.
Mixtard led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c, indicating that blood glucose levels had been controlled to a similar level to that seen with other human insulin.
Mixtard should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin human (rDNA) or to any of the other ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Mixtard’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of diabetes.

Imprida 5 mg/ 80 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 80 mg alone.
Individual dose titration with the components (i. e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before changing to the fixed dose combination.
Hepatic impairment Caution should be exercised when administering Imprida to patients with hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4).
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).
Sodium- and/ or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Imprida in placebo-controlled studies.
In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as volume- and/ or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin receptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur.
If hypotension occurs with Imprida, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.
Hyperkalaemia Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be undertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels.
Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Imprida in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment of Imprida is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR &gt; 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2).
3 Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease.
Heart failure As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals.
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
The possibility that more potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i. e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem cannot be excluded.
Interactions linked to valsartan Concomitant use not recommended Lithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE inhibitors.
4 Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum potassium.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
Animal studies indicates that the valsartan/ amlodipine has reproductive toxicity in line with what has been described for valsartan and other angiotensin II antagonists (see section 5.3).
Because of the potential adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy, taking into account the importance of this therapy for the mother.
The safety of Imprida has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 patients, 2,613 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine.
Additional information on the combination Peripheral oedema, a recognised side effect of amlodipine, was generally observed at a lower incidence in patients who received the amlodipine/ valsartan combination than in those who received amlodipine alone.
Additional information on the individual components Adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (amlodipine or valsartan) may be potential undesirable effects with Imprida as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during the post-marketing period.
Rarely, patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase.
Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption.
Clinically significant hypotension due to Imprida overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine), ATC code:
Imprida combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines.
The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure.
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.
As with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/ dt or on
In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans.
In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.
The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 receptor.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
Valsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin.
Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing.
In clinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE inhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9%, respectively).
In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough during ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those receiving a thiazide diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE inhibitor (p &lt; 0.05).
In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4– 6 hours.
Patients with high cardiovascular risks – heart failure, type I and poorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year – were excluded.
The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/ 4.8 mmHg and 3.9/ 2.9 mmHg, respectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only.
The addition of valsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 2.9/ 2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only.
Imprida was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and &lt; 120 mmHg.
In patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema.
In patients adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg but who experience unacceptable oedema, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.
Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/ h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/ h (about 30% of total clearance).
Amlodipine/ Valsartan Following oral administration of Imprida, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are reached in 3 and 6– 8 hours, respectively.
As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.
On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight).
Histopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an exposure of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).
Imprida 5 mg/ 160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone.
15 Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease.
16 Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Imprida 10 mg/ 160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine 10 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone or with Imprida 5 mg/ 160 mg.
27 Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease.

Amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. − Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “ angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”.
Imprida is used to treat high blood pressure in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own.
Do not take Imprida − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amlodipine or other medicines of the dihydropyridine type, − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of Imprida.
Imprida is not recommended in early pregnancy and may cause serious harm to your baby if taken after 3 months of pregnancy (see section “ Pregnancy and breast-feeding”).
John’ s wort; − nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called “ vasodilators”; − medicines used for HIV/ AIDS (e. g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e. g. ketoconazole).
Usually, your doctor will advise you to take another medicine instead of Imprida, as Imprida is not recommended in early pregnancy, and may cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after 3 months of pregnancy.
So, if you are not sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you need to concentrate on.
The usual dose of Imprida is one tablet per day. − It is advisable to take your medicine at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. − Swallow the tablets with a glass of water. − You can take Imprida with or without food.
If you take more Imprida than you should If you have taken too many tablets of Imprida, or if someone else has taken your tablets, consult a doctor immediately.

Imprida is used in patients who have essential hypertension (high blood pressure) that is not adequately controlled on either amlodipine or valsartan taken alone. ‘ Essential ’ means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.
Valsartan is an ‘ angiotensin II receptor antagonist’, which means that it blocks the action of a hormone in the body called angiotensin II.
By blocking the receptors to which angiotensin II normally attaches, valsartan stops the hormone having an effect, allowing the blood vessels to widen.
Because amlodipine and valsartan have been used for many years, the company presented information on the two substances from earlier studies and the scientific literature, as well as new studies that used a combination of the two active substances.
Two studies (involving almost 3,200 patients) compared the effectiveness of amlodipine, valsartan or a combination of both substances with the effectiveness of placebo (a dummy treatment).
Two studies (involving 1,891 patients) compared the effects of the combination in patients whose hypertension was not adequately controlled with either 10 mg amlodipine or 160 mg valsartan.
The fifth, smaller study compared the effectiveness of the combination with that of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (another combination used to treat hypertension) in 130 patients with severe hypertension.
The company also presented evidence that the levels of amlodipine and valsartan in the blood were the same in people taking Imprida and people taking the separate medicines.
The combination of amlodipine and valsartan was more effective at reducing blood pressure than placebo or either valsartan or amlodipine taken alone.
Patients taking amlodipine alone had a fall of 10.0 mmHg, compared with 11.8 mmHg in the patients adding 160 mg valsartan.
Imprida should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amlodipine or other medicines in the ‘ dihydropyridine derivatives’ class, to valsartan, or to any of the other ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Imprida’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of essential hypertension in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy.
Atripla is a medicine containing three active substances: efavirenz (600 mg), emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg).
It is only used in patients whose levels of HIV in the blood (viral loads) have been below 50 copies/ ml for more than three months on their current HIV treatment combination.
Patients must be known not to have been infected with HIV that was unlikely to respond to any of the three active substances in Atripla before they started their first HIV treatment combination.
If patients need to stop taking efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil, or need to take different doses, they will need to take medicines containing efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil separately.
Atripla should not be taken at the same time as other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil, or lamivudine (another antiviral medicine).
After 48 weeks, 89% of the patients taking Atripla (181 out of 203) and 88% of those remaining on previous treatment (85 out of 97) had viral loads below 200 copies/ ml.
Atripla should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other ingredients.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Atripla may be at increased risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
As with other medicines containing NRTIs, Atripla may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Atripla needs to be taken on an empty stomach to prevent certain side effects, but that this could result in low tenofovir levels in the blood.
Therefore, the Committee concluded that Atripla could be a convenient ‘ one-tablet once-a- day’ treatment when used to maintain low viral loads in patients already taking HIV treatment, but 2/ 3 there is not enough information to be certain about its effects in patients who have not been treated before.
Therefore, the Committee decided that Atripla’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults with virologic suppression to HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of less than 50 copies/ ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three months.
The Committee noted that the demonstration of Atripla’ s benefit is based mainly on 48-week data from a study in patients with stable suppression of HIV on an HIV treatment combination who then switched to Atripla.
The company that makes Atripla will make sure that the medicine is used safely, bearing in mind concerns over possible effects of tenofovir disoproxil on the kidneys.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Atripla to Bristol-Myers Squibb And Gilead Sciences Limited on 13 December 2007.
Each film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of efavirenz, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate).
It is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of &lt; 50 copies/ ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three months.
The demonstration of the benefit of Atripla is primarily based on 48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic suppression on a combination antiretroviral therapy changed to Atripla (see section 5.1).
It is recommended that Atripla be taken on an empty stomach since food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
2 In order to improve the tolerability to efavirenz with respect to undesirable effects on the nervous system, bedtime dosing is recommended (see section 4.8).
It is anticipated that tenofovir exposure will be approximately 35% lower following administration of Atripla on an empty stomach as compared to the individual component tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when taken with food (see section 5.2).
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Atripla to the elderly, keeping in mind the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or renal function in these patients.
Dose adjustment: if Atripla is co-administered with rifampicin, an additional 200 mg/ day (800 mg total) of efavirenz is recommended (see section 4.5).
Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require dose interval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT), Grade A or B) may be treated with the normal recommended dose of Atripla (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).
If Atripla is discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV, these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4).
Patients should be told that if they forget to take Atripla, they should take the missed dose right away, unless it is less than 12 hours until the next day’ s dose.
Where discontinuation of therapy with one of the components of Atripla is indicated or where dose modification is necessary, separate preparations of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are available.
If therapy with Atripla is discontinued, consideration should be given to the long half-life of efavirenz (see section 5.2) and long intracellular half-lives of tenofovir and emtricitabine.
Because of interpatient variability in these parameters and concerns regarding development of resistance, HIV treatment guidelines should be consulted, also taking into consideration the reason for discontinuation.
Atripla must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine,
John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking Atripla due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5).
Since Atripla is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and Atripla must not be co-administered (see section 4.5).
General: as a fixed combination, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing any of the same active components, efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
Due to similarities with emtricitabine, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.5).
Currently available data indicate a trend that in patients on a PI-based antiretroviral regimen the switch to Atripla may lead to a reduction of the response to the therapy (see section 5.1).
These patients should be carefully monitored for rises in viral load and, since the safety profile of efavirenz differs from that of protease inhibitors, for adverse reactions.
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatic steatosis, has been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues.
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactataemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Treatment with nucleoside analogues must be discontinued in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactataemia and metabolic/ lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.
Opportunistic infections: patients receiving Atripla or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases.
Transmission of HIV: patients must be advised that antiretroviral therapies, including Atripla, have not been proven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.
Liver disease: the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Atripla have not been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders (see section 5.2).
4 by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system, caution should be exercised in administering Atripla to patients with mild-to-moderate liver disease.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued therapy with Atripla needs to be weighed against the potential risks of significant liver toxicity.
Patients with HIV and hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus (HCV) co-infection: patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.
Limited clinical experience suggests that emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate have an anti-HBV activity when used in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection.
Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue Atripla must be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least four months after stopping treatment with Atripla.
In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation.
Nervous system symptoms: symptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming are frequently reported undesirable effects in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg daily in clinical studies.
Nervous system symptoms associated with efavirenz usually begin during the first one or two days of therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks.
Patients should be informed that if they do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are not predictive of subsequent onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms.
Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medicinal products primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels.
In a drug interaction study, carbamazepine plasma concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with efavirenz (see section 4.5).
Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in clinical practice (see section 4.8).
It is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with Atripla and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored every four weeks during the first year and then every three months.
Since Atripla is a combination product and the dosing interval of the individual components cannot be altered, treatment with Atripla must be interrupted in patients with confirmed creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/ min or decreases in serum phosphate to &lt; 1.0 mg/ dl (0.32 mmol/ l).
Severe rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration has been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz (see section 4.8).
Patients who discontinued treatment with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors due to rash may be at higher risk of developing rash during treatment with Atripla.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients.
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhibitors (PI) and lipoatrophy and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has been hypothesised.
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug-related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.
6 Effect of food: the administration of Atripla with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may lead to an increase in frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.8).
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactataemia, hyperlipasaemia).
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV negative children, should have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: in HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/ or focal mycobacterial infections, and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii).
Decreases in bone mineral density of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group at 144 weeks.
Didanosine: co-administration of Atripla and didanosine is not recommended since exposure to didanosine is significantly increased following co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see section 4.5).
Atripla should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R, M184V/ I or K103N mutation (see sections 4.1 and 5.1).
Excipients: this medicinal product contains 1 mmol (23.6 mg) of sodium per dose which should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
As Atripla contains efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with Atripla.
As a fixed combination, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing any of the components, efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil as fumarate.
Due to similarities with emtricitabine, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine.
Efavirenz is an inducer of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of some CYP450 isoenzymes including CYP3A4 (see section 5.2).
Efavirenz exposure may also be altered when given with medicinal products or food (for example, grapefruit juice) which affect CYP3A4 activity.
In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP450- mediated interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with other medicinal products is low.
Since Atripla is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and Atripla must not be co-administered (see section 4.3 and Table 1).
Concomitant use not recommended Atazanavir/ ritonavir: insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for atazanavir/ ritonavir in combination with Atripla.
Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4).
co-administration with Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg)
ANTI-INFECTIVES Antiretrovirals Protease inhibitors Amprenavir/ Efavirenz (1,200 b. i. d. / 600 q. d.)

AUC: ↓ 25% (↓ 42 to ↓ 3) Cmax: ↓ 28% (↓ 50 to ↑ 5) Cmin: ↓ 26% (↓ 46 to ↑ 10) Co-administration of atazanavir/ ritonavir with tenofovir resulted in increased exposure to tenofovir.
Co-administration of efavirenz with atazanavir in combination with low-dose ritonavir resulted in substantial decreases in atazanavir exposure due to CYP3A4 induction, necessitating dosage adjustment of atazanavir (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the medicinal product containing atazanavir).
Co-administration of efavirenz and atazanavir in combination with ritonavir may lead to increases in efavirenz exposure which may worsen the tolerability profile of efavirenz.
While the clinical significance of decreased indinavir concentrations has not been established, the magnitude of the observed pharmacokinetic interaction should be taken into consideration when choosing a regimen containing both efavirenz, a component of Atripla, and indinavir.
Lopinavir/ Ritonavir/ Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (400 b. i. d. / 100 b. i. d. / 300 q. d.)
AUC: ↑ 32% (↑ 25 to ↑ 38) Cmax: ↔ Cmin: ↑ 51% (↑ 37 to ↑ 66) Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders.
Co-administration of lopinavir/ ritonavir with efavirenz resulted in a substantial decrease in lopinavir exposure, necessitating dosage adjustment of lopinavir/ ritonavir.
Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for lopinavir/ ritonavir tablets for pharmacokinetic data when this formulation was administered with efavirenz.
For co-administration of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir in combination with a protease inhibitor, see section on ritonavir below.
Sufficient data on the tolerability of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir (100 mg, once or twice daily) are not available.
When using Atripla in a regimen including low-dose ritonavir, the possibility of an increase in the incidence of efavirenz-associated adverse events should be considered, due to possible pharmacodynamic interaction.
AUC: ↓ 62% (↓ 45 to ↓ 74) Cmax: ↓ 50% (↓ 28 to ↓ 66) Cmin: ↓ 56% (↓ 16 to ↓ 77) (decrease in saquinavir concentrations:
AUC: ↓ 12% (↓ 4 to ↓ 19) Cmax: ↓ 13% (↓ 5 to ↓ 20) Cmin: ↓ 14% (↓ 2 to ↓ 24)
AUC: ↔ Cmax: ↔ Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with ritonavir boosted saquinavir also resulted in no pharmacokinetic interaction.
For co-administration of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir in combination with a protease inhibitor, see section on ritonavir above.
Specific interaction studies have not been performed with efavirenz and NRTIs other than lamivudine (see section 4.4), zidovudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
Clinically significant interactions would not be expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways.
Since use of two NNRTIs proved not beneficial in terms of efficacy and safety, co-administration of Atripla and another NNRTI is not recommended.
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine-related adverse events.
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i. e. active) didanosine.
A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virologic failure within several tested combinations.

AUC: ↑ 44% Cmax: ↑ 38% (competitive inhibition of oxidative metabolism) Co-administration of standard doses of efavirenz and voriconazole is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Since Atripla is a fixed- dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and Atripla must not be co-administered.
AUC: ↓ 27% (↓ 20 to ↓ 33) Cmax: ↓ 20% (↓ 15 to ↓ 24) Cmin: ↓ 35% (↓ 24 to ↓ 44) Efavirenz:
AUC: ↓ 36% (↓ 32 to ↓ 40) Cmax: ↓ 21% (↓ 15 to ↓ 26) Cmin: ↓ 47% (↓ 41 to ↓ 53) (decrease in carbamazepine concentrations:
CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 induction) Co-administration of higher doses of either efavirenz or carbamazepine has not been studied.
There is a potential for reduction or increase in the plasma concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital and other anticonvulsants that are substrates of CYP450 isoenzymes with efavirenz.
When Atripla is co- administered with an anticonvulsant that is a substrate of CYP450 isoenzymes, periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant levels should be conducted.
Clinically significant interactions are not expected since vigabatrin and gabapentin are exclusively eliminated unchanged in the urine and are unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways as efavirenz.
14 ANTIDEPRESSANTS Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) Sertraline/ Efavirenz (50 q. d. / 600 q. d.)
AUC: ↓ 39% (↓ 27 to ↓ 50) Cmax: ↓ 29% (↓ 15 to ↓ 40) Cmin: ↓ 46% (↓ 31 to ↓ 58) Efavirenz:
Since fluoxetine shares a similar metabolic profile with paroxetine, i. e. a strong CYP2D6 inhibitory effect, a similar lack of interaction would be expected for fluoxetine.
Fluoxetine/ Emtricitabine Fluoxetine/ Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate CARDIOVASCULAR AGENTS Calcium Channel Blockers

Dose adjustments of diltiazem when co- administered with Atripla should be guided by clinical response (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for diltiazem).
When efavirenz is co- administered with a calcium channel blocker that is a substrate of the CYP3A4 enzyme, there is a potential for reduction in the plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker.
calcium channel blockers when co-administered with Atripla should be guided by clinical response (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the calcium channel blocker).

Because the potential interaction of efavirenz, a component of Atripla, with oral contraceptives has not been fully characterised, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to oral contraceptives
Tacrolimus/ Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (0.1 mg/ kg q. d. / 200 mg/ 300 mg q. d.)
Patients receiving methadone and Atripla concomitantly should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when emtricitabine was administered with stavudine, zidovudine or famciclovir.
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was co-administered with adefovir dipivoxil, emtricitabine, nelfinavir or ribavirin.
Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for example, oral or other hormonal contraceptives) while on therapy with Atripla.
In post-marketing experience through an antiretroviral pregnancy registry, more than 200 pregnancies with first-trimester exposure to efavirenz as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen have been reported with no specific malformation pattern.
Retrospectively in this registry, a small number of cases of neural tube defects, including meningomyelocele, have been reported but causality has not been established.
Lactation: studies in rats have demonstrated that efavirenz and tenofovir are excreted in milk; concentrations of efavirenz were much higher than those in maternal plasma.
Because of the potential for both HIV transmission and the potential for serious undesirable effects in breast-feeding infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving Atripla.
However, dizziness has been reported during treatment with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100, &lt; 1/ 10) or uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, &lt; 1/ 100).
Treatment-emergent adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to study drugs reported in patients who received Atripla in study AI266073 are listed by body system organ class and frequency in Table 2.
Selected treatment-emergent adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to study drugs from this study reported in patients after 144 weeks of treatment are listed by body system organ class and frequency in Table 3.
Selected treatment-emergent adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to study drugs (efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in clinical study GS-01-934 over 144 weeks

Adverse reactions associated with the individual components of Atripla The adverse reactions from clinical study and post-marketing experience with the individual components of Atripla in antiretroviral combination therapy are listed in Table 4 below by body system organ class and frequency.
The administration of efavirenz with food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.4).
There have been post-marketing reports in association with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate of renal and urinary disorders including renal failure, proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome), acute tubular necrosis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Very common Common somnolence, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness Uncommon convulsions, amnesia, thinking abnormal, ataxia, coordination abnormal, agitation Not known* cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances Eye disorders:
renal failure (acute and chronic), acute tubular necrosis, proximal renal tubulopathy including Fanconi syndrome, nephritis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, increased creatinine, proteinuria
allergic reaction, vesiculobullous rash, pustular rash, maculopapular rash, rash, pruritus, urticaria, skin discolouration (increased pigmentation)
elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/ or elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hyperbilirubinaemia
These events are not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy in the absence of proximal renal tubulopathy.
Rash with efavirenz: rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz.
Experience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class is limited.
Nervous system symptoms with efavirenz: in clinical controlled studies, nervous system symptoms of moderate-to-severe intensity were experienced by 19.4% of patients compared to 9.0% of patients receiving control regimens.
Nervous system symptoms may occur more frequently when efavirenz is taken concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2).
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatic steatosis, has been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
The adverse reaction profile of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients co-infected with HIV/ HBV or HIV/ HCV was similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection.
Amylase: in clinical studies, asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels &gt; 1.5 times the ULN were seen in 10% of patients treated with efavirenz and 6% of patients treated with control regimens.
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: in HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Efavirenz non-competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and does not significantly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) RT or cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases (α, β, γ, and δ).
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is converted in vivo to tenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate.
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate, respectively.
Both emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA polymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo.
Antiviral activity in vitro: efavirenz demonstrated antiviral activity against most non-clade B isolates (subtypes A, AE, AG, C, D, F, G, J, and N) but had reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses.
In combination studies evaluating the in vitro antiviral activity of efavirenz and emtricitabine together, efavirenz and tenofovir together, and emtricitabine and tenofovir together, additive to synergistic antiviral effects were observed.
25 Resistance: resistance to efavirenz can be selected in vitro and resulted in single or multiple amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 RT, including L100I, V108I, V179D, and Y181C.
Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 190 or 225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N.
Cross-resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in vitro demonstrated that the K103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs.
Resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the development of an M184V or M184I substitution in RT with emtricitabine or a K65R substitution in RT with tenofovir.
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/ I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine.
The K65R mutation can also be selected by abacavir or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these agents plus lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir.
Patients with HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that included either an M41L or an L210W substitution in RT showed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
* p-value &lt; 0.05, Fisher’ s Exact test comparing efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group to efavirenz + lamivudine/ zidovudine group among all patients.
1 Other efavirenz resistance mutations included A98G (n=1), K103E (n=1), V179D (n=1), and M230L (n=1).
Patients who completed 144 weeks of treatment with either treatment arm in study GS-01-934 were given the option to continue in an open-label extended phase of the study with Atripla on an empty stomach.
160 had previously received efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and 126 had previously received Combivir and efavirenz.
In 91% of the patients the HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations remained &lt; 50 copies/ ml and in 97% &lt; 400 copies/ ml, after 24 weeks of Atripla treatment (intention to treat analysis (ITT), missing=failure).
Patients had never experienced virological failure on a previous antiretroviral therapy, had no known HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to any of the three components within Atripla, and had been virologically suppressed for at least three months at baseline.
27 week data showed that high levels of virologic suppression, comparable to the original treatment regimen, were maintained in patients who were randomised to change to Atripla (see Table 6).
Post-hoc analysis where patients who failed virologically or discontinued for adverse events were treated as failures; for other drop-outs, the LOCF (last observation carried forward) method was applied
In the prior-NNRTI stratum, response rates were 98.9% vs 97.4% for Atripla and SBR patients respectively; a difference (95%CI) of 1.4% (-4.0%, 6.9%).
There is no clinical experience with Atripla in patients who are experiencing virological failure in a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen or in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
The separate pharmaceutical forms of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were used to determine the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, administered separately in HIV infected patients.
Reference: single dose of a 600 mg efavirenz tablet, 200 mg emtricitabine capsule and 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet taken under fasted conditions.
Administration of efavirenz capsules with a high fat meal increased the mean AUC and Cmax of efavirenz by 28% and 79%, respectively, compared to administration in a fasted state.
Atripla is recommended for administration on an empty stomach since food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
It is anticipated that tenofovir exposure will be approximately 35% lower following administration of Atripla on an empty stomach as compared to the individual component tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when taken with food.
Forty-eight week data from a clinical study (AI266073) showed maintenance of virologic suppression for patients who had stable virologic suppression on combination
In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins is &lt; 4% and independent of concentrations over the range of 0.02 to 200 µg/ ml.
In vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma or serum protein is &lt; 0.7% and 7.2%, respectively over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 µg/ ml.
Biotransformation: studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz is principally metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites.
The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isoenzymes responsible for efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibits P450 isoenzymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.
In in vitro studies efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at concentrations well above those achieved clinically.
Efavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with homozygous G516T genetic variant of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme.
The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, the potential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be excluded.
In uninfected volunteers, multiple doses of 200 to 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation (22 to 42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life of 40 to 55 hours (single dose half-life 52 to 76 hours).
The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose).
Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation.
Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation.
Elimination: efavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses (see also data from bioequivalence study described above) and 40 to 55 hours after multiple doses.
Approximately 14 to 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was recovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz.
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in urine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).
Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system with approximately 70 to 80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous administration.
Although limited data suggest that females as well as Asian and Pacific Island patients may have higher exposure to efavirenz, they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz.
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir in the elderly (over 65 years).
Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate after co-administration of the separate pharmaceutical forms or as Atripla have not been studied in HIV infected patients with renal impairment.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined following administration of single doses of the individual preparations of emtricitabine 200 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected patients with varying degrees of renal impairment.
However, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on exposure to efavirenz is likely to be minimal.
Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require dose interval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
In the single patient studied with severe hepatic impairment (CPT, Grade C), half-life of efavirenz was doubled indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation.
A single 300 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered to non-HIV infected patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to CPT classification.
Tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment suggesting that no dose adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is required in these subjects.
Malformations were observed in 3 of 20 foetuses/ newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in plasma efavirenz concentrations similar to those seen in humans.
Anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia with secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, micro-ophthalmia was observed in another foetus, and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus.
Carcinogenicity studies using efavirenz showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female mice, but not in male mice.
While the carcinogenic potential in humans is unknown, these data suggest that the clinical benefit of efavirenz outweighs the potential carcinogenic risk to humans.
A long-term oral carcinogenicity study in mice showed a low incidence of duodenal tumours, considered likely related to high local concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract at a dose of 600 mg/ kg/ day.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was positive in two out of three in vitro genotoxicity studies but negative in the in vivo micronucleus assay.
The combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, with comparable results to those obtained for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone.
Biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given efavirenz for ≥ 1 year at a dose resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose.
Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys receiving efavirenz for ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those in humans given the recommended dose (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Preclinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate conducted in rats, dogs and monkeys revealed effects on bone and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration.
32 A one month dog study using the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate found no exacerbation of toxicological effects compared to the separate components.

The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 3 (February 2008) of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented with the first PSUR and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
Atripla 600 mg/ 200 mg/ 245 mg film-coated tablets efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil
Each of these active substances, also known as antiretroviral medicines, work by interfering with an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to multiply.
Atripla is a treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults aged 18 and over who have previously been treated with other antiretroviral medicines and have their HIV-1 infection under control for at least three months.
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil
if you are taking other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil.
if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin.
If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking Atripla.
Patients with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with combination antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems.
Your doctor may then conduct blood tests at regular intervals in order to check how well your liver is working (see Section 3, If you stop taking Atripla).
Combination antiretroviral therapies (including Atripla) may raise blood sugar levels, increase blood fats (hyperlipaemia), cause changes to body fat, and resistance to insulin (see Section 4, Possible side effects).
Some HIV medicines, including Atripla, that contain nucleoside analogues can cause lactic acidosis (excess of lactic acid in your blood), together with an enlarged liver.
Deep, rapid breathing, drowsiness, and symptoms such as feeling sick (nausea), vomiting and stomach pain, might indicate the development of lactic acidosis.
It is believed that these symptoms are due to improvement in the body’ s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
Also, Atripla should not be taken with any other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil.
Inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported rarely when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine were taken together.
efavirenz, a component of Atripla, to interact with hormonal contraceptives has not been fully studied, a reliable method of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) should always be used in addition to the hormonal contraceptive (see Section Pregnancy and breast-feeding).
If you could get pregnant while receiving Atripla, you need to use a reliable form of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection).
If your doctor decides to stop one of the components of Atripla, you may be given efavirenz, emtricitabine and/ or tenofovir disoproxil separately or with other medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection.
Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (two of the three components of Atripla).
In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening.
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to tell whether some of the unwanted effects are caused by Atripla or by other medicines that you are taking at the same time, or by the HIV disease itself.
49 Other possible effects (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a serious side effect that can be life-threatening.
These include changes to your urine, increased level of creatinine in your blood, and back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure and damage to kidney tubule cells.
Breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may also occur in patients who develop damage to the kidney tubule cells.
Other unwanted effects include: itchy rash to the skin caused by a reaction to sunlight, shortness of breath, fatty liver, disturbances of coordination and balance.
You may lose fat from your legs, arms and face; gain fat around the abdomen (tummy) and internal organs; get larger breasts or fatty lumps on the back of the neck (‘ buffalo hump’).
film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of efavirenz, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate).
Atripla film-coated tablets are pink, capsule shaped tablets, engraved on one side with the number “ 123” and plain on the other side.
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) web site: http: / /www. emea. europa. eu/.
1 pre-filled syringe with 0.3 ml solution for injection contains 1000 international units (IU) epoetin zeta* (recombinant human erythropoietin).
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4)
2 The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2-7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9-6.8 mmol/ l).
Anemia symptoms and sequaelea may vary with age, gender and overall burden of disesase; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Retacrit should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L) Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (&lt; 6 g/ dl or&lt; 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g/dl or&gt; 5 mmol/l).
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg, 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved.
3 The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (&lt; 6.8 g/ dl or&lt; 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial haemoglobin is higher &gt; 6.8 g/dl or&gt; 4.25 mmol/l).
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).
Retacrit should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
If the haemoglobin increase is &lt; 1 g/ dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
4 has increased &lt; 1 g/ dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
Dose adjustment At a rate of rise in haemoglobin of &gt; 2 g/ dl (&gt; 1.25 mmol/ l) per month the Retacrit dose should be reduced by about 25-50%.
If haemoglobin level exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) or lower and then reinstitute Retacrit therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33-39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Retacrit at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Retacrit therapy.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the medicinal product into the circulation.
Blood pressure should be closely monitored and adequately controlled in all epoetin treatment naïve as well as pre-treated patients before, at initiation of, and during treatment with Retacrit.
6 All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12- or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating and during therapy with Retacrit.
200-300 mg/ day orally (100-200 mg/ day for paediatric patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml − oral iron substitution of 200-300 mg/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Retacrit in patients at risk for antibody-induced Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimize the risk of developing or worsening of hypertension.
These include: iron, folate, or Vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing erythropoietin administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with erythropoietin as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with erythropoietin in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2-3 week delay between erythropoietin administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if Retacrit therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
Several controlled clinical studies in which epoetins were administered to patients with a variety of common tumours including squamous head and neck cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, have shown an unexplained excess mortality.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life- expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1)
If erythropoietin is given concomitantly with ciclosporin, blood levels of ciclosporin should be monitored and the dose of ciclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.
Consequently, erythropoietin should generally be used during pregnancy and lactation only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
"Flu-like" symptoms such as headaches, joint pains, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
Epoetin zeta is identical in its amino acid sequence and similar in carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
After administration of erythropoietin, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with erythropoietin.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that erythropoietin stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastrointestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomized, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
Intravenous route Measurement of erythropoietin following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life of approximately 5 hours in renal failure patients.
Subcutaneous route Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of erythropoietin are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and 18 hours postdose.
In some pre-clinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, erythropoietin therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with erythropoietin for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with erythropoietin).
In animal studies, erythropoietin has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
Erythropoietin did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
For the purpose of ambulatory use, the patient may remove the product from the refrigerator and store it at room temperature (not above 25°C) for one single period of up to 3 days.
After removing one syringe from the blister pack the solution should be checked to ensure that it is clear, colourless and practically free from visible particles.
The protective cap is removed from the injection needle and air is expelled from the syringe and needle by holding the syringe vertically and gently pressing the plunger upwards.
1 pre-filled syringe with 0.6 ml solution for injection contains 2000 international units (IU) epoetin zeta* (recombinant human erythropoietin).
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patientsIn patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4)
15 The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2-7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9-6.8 mmol/ l).
16 The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (&lt; 6.8 g/ dl or&lt; 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial haemoglobin is higher &gt; 6.8 g/dl or&gt; 4.25 mmol/l).
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia Retacrit should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
However, if the haemoglobin has increased &lt; 1 g/ dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
17 Once the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced by 25 to 50% in order to maintain haemoglobin at that level.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12- or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating and during therapy with Retacrit.
200-300 mg/ day orally (100-200 mg/ day for paediatric patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml − oral iron substitution of 200-300 mg/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
21 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
24 apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.

You may need to read it again. − If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. − This medicine has been prescribed for you.
It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours. − If any of the side effects becomes serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
you had a heart attack or stroke in the month before your treatment you have unstable angina pectoris (new or increasing chest pain) you are at risk of blood clots in the veins (deep venous thrombosis) – for example, if you have had clots before.
If you experience headaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches or start to feel confused or have fits, tell your doctor or nursing staff immediately.
Remember to tell your doctor that you are receiving Retacrit if you have to visit the hospital or family doctor for any treatmentincluding a blood test, as Retacrit may affect the results.
Therefore, if you are being treated for anaemia associated with kidney disease, Retacrit has to be given by injection into a vein (intravenously).
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) has been reported very rarely after months to years of subcutaneous treatment with other products containing erythropoietins and may not be ruled out with Retacrit.
185 PRCA may be caused by the production to antibodies against the erythropoietin product and, in the following, to your own erythropoietin.
If PRCA, a very rare condition, occurs, the Retacrit therapy will be stopped and your doctor will determine the best course of action to treat the anaemia.
Although this complication is very rare, you should be aware that if you develop it, you would need to have regular blood transfusions, possibly lifelong, to treat your anaemia and the Retacrit therapy would have to be discontinued.
Chronic renal failure patients on erythropoietin should have their haemoglobin (the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen) levels measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved, and periodically thereafter to minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressure.
If you are a patient with chronic kidney disease, your doctor will check that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level as high haemoglobin could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of death.
If you are receiving dialysis treatment when you begin treatment with Retacrit, your dialysis regimen may need to be adjusted to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium levels in the desired range.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected, your doctor may consider to stop the treatment with Retacrit until the level is back to normal.
An increase in the dose of a particular blood-thinning medicine (heparin) during haemodialysis is often needed during the course of therapy with Retacrit to minimize the risk of blood clotting.
Therefore, you should discuss the benefits of Retacrit with your doctor, particularly if you are obese or have a history of blood clots/blood clotting disorders.
Cancer patients on erythropoietin should have haemoglobin (the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen) levels measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved, and periodically thereafter.
If you are a cancer patient, you should be aware that Retacrit, may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer.
In particular, if you are taking a medicine containing the active substance ciclosporin to suppress your immune system after a kidney transplant, your doctor may order special blood tests to measure ciclosporin levels while you are taking Retacrit.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, Retacrit should be used only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
He/she will work out the correct dose of Retacrit for you to use, how long the treatment should continue and by what route the medicine will be given.
Use in adult patients receiving haemodialysis Your doctor will maintain your haemoglobin concentration between 10 and 12 g/dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/l).
The dose you receive should not normally exceed 200 IU/kg 3 times a week, and should be given by injection into a vein or a tube that goes into a vein.
Use in children and adolescents up to 18 years receiving haemodialysis In children the doctor will maintain the haemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g/dl
The total weekly dose that you receive should not normally exceed 200 IU/kg and should be given by injection into a vein or a tube that goes into a vein.
The dosage should not normally exceed 200 IU/kg, 3 times a week and should be given by injection into a vein or a tube that goes into a vein.
The starting dose may be adjusted by your doctor depending on how your anaemia responds to treatment; you will usually receive Retacrit until 1 month after the end of chemotherapy.
Remove the protective cap from the injection needle and expel air from the syringe and injection needle by holding the syringe vertically and gently pressing the plunger upwards.
• the blister sealing is broken or the blister is damaged in any way • the liquid is coloured or you can see particles floating in it • any liquid has leaked out of the pre-filled syringe or condensation is visible within the sealed blister • you know or think it may have been accidentally frozen
Changing from injecting into a vein to injecting under the skin (from intravenous into subcutaneous injection) Once your condition is controlled you will receive regular doses of Retacrit.
If your anaemia is not associated with kidney disease, your doctor may decide that it is better for you to receive Retacrit by injection under the skin (subcutaneous) rather than into a vein (intravenous).
Injecting Retacrit under the skin yourself for anaemia not associated with kidney disease At the start of your therapy, Retacrit is injected by medical or nursing staff.
189 – skin rash – flu-like symptoms, such as headache, aches and pains in the joints, feeling of weakness, tiredness, dizziness.
These may be more common at the start of treatment. – An increase in levels of blood platelets (thrombocytes) which are normally involved in the formation of a blood clot may occur.
Your doctor may monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Retacrit, particularly at the start of therapy. – Occlusion in the connection between artery and vein (shunt thrombosis) may occur especially if you have low blood pressure or if your arteriovenous fistula has complications.
Cancer patients – blood clotting (thrombotic vascular events) (see section “Take special care with Retacrit”). – increase of blood pressure.

The pre-filled syringes contain between 0.3 and 1.0 ml solution, depending on the content of epoetin zeta (see “What Retacrit contains”).
It is available in pre-filled syringes containing between 1,000 and 40,000 international units (IU) of the active substance, epoetin zeta.
This means that Retacrit is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union (EU) and contains a similar active substance (also known as the ‘ reference medicine’).
Treatment with Retacrit must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the management of patients with the conditions that the medicine is used for.
For patients with kidney problems or about to undergo surgery, Retacrit must be injected intravenously (into a vein), while patients receiving chemotherapy receive it subcutaneously (under the skin).
The dose, the frequency of injection and how long it is used for depend on why Retacrit is being used, and are adjusted according to the patient’ s response.
The active substance in Retacrit, epoetin zeta, is a copy of human erythropoietin and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production.
The active substance in Retacrit, epoetin zeta, is produced by ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce erythropoietin.
Retacrit, injected intravenously, was compared with the reference medicine in two main studies involving 922 patients who had anaemia associated with chronic renal failure requiring haemodialysis (a blood clearance technique).
The first study compared the effects of Retacrit with those of EPREX/ ERYPO in correcting red blood cell counts in 609 patients over 24 weeks.
All of the patients in the second study had been receiving treatment with EPREX/ ERYPO for at least three months before they were either switched to Retacrit or remained on EPREX/ ERYPO for 12 weeks.
In both studies, the main measures of effectiveness were the levels of haemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body) during treatment, as well as the dose of epoetin received.
In the correction study, haemoglobin levels were around 11.6 g/ dl during the last four weeks of the study, having risen from around 8.0 g/ dl before treatment.
In the study of patients already being treated with an epoetin, haemoglobin levels were maintained to the same extent when the patients were receiving Retacrit and when they were receiving EPREX/ ERYPO, at around 11.4 g/ dl.
The study in patients receiving chemotherapy showed that Retacrit was also effective when it was injected subcutaneously, with similar improvements in haemoglobin levels as those reported in the scientific literature for other epoetins.
As with other medicines containing an epoetin, the most common side effect with Retacrit is an increase in blood pressure, which can sometimes lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stabbing migraine-like headache and confusion.
Retacrit should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin zeta or any of the other ingredients.
Retacrit is not recommended for subcutaneous injection in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this does not cause allergic reactions.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, Retacrit has been shown to have a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile to EPREX/ ERYPO.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Retacrit to HOSPIRA Enterprises B. V. on 18 December 2007.
Evista is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in women who have been through the menopause.
Osteoporosis is more common in women after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall: oestrogen slows down bone breakdown and makes the bones less likely to fracture.
Raloxifene acts as an ‘ agonist ’ of the oestrogen receptor (a substance that stimulates the receptor for oestrogen) in some tissues in the body.
In the prevention of osteoporosis, women receiving Evista had an increase in bone density in the hip or spine of 1.6% over two years, and those receiving placebo had a decrease of 0.8%.
Over four years, in comparison with placebo, Evista decreased the number of new vertebral fractures by 46% in women who had osteoporosis and by 32% in women who had osteoporosis and an existing fracture.
The most common side effects with Evista (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are vasodilation (hot flushes) and flu-like symptoms.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Evista had shown its effectiveness in preventing and treating osteoporosis, and had no effects on the breast or womb.
When determining the choice of EVISTA or other therapies, including oestrogens, for an individual postmenopausal woman, consideration should be given to menopausal symptoms, effects on uterine and breast tissues, and cardiovascular risks and benefits (see section 5.1).
Active or past history of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and retinal vein thrombosis.
Raloxifene is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolic events that is similar to the reported risk associated with current use of hormone replacement therapy.
In a study of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events, raloxifene did not affect the incidence of myocardial infarction, hospitalized acute coronary syndrome, overall mortality, including overall cardiovascular mortality, or stroke, compared to placebo.
This finding should be considered when prescribing raloxifene for postmenopausal women with a history of stroke or other significant stroke risk factors, such as transient ischemic attack or atrial fibrillation.
In postmenopausal women who received raloxifene treatment for 4 years, benign endometrial polyps were reported in 0.9% compared to 0.3% in women who received placebo treatment.
Single doses of raloxifene given to patients with cirrhosis and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) produced plasma concentrations of raloxifene which were approximately 2.5 times the controls.
Serum total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, ALT and AST should be closely monitored during treatment if elevated values are observed.
Limited clinical data suggest that in patients with a history of oral oestrogen-induced hypertriglyceridemia (&gt; 5.6 mmol/ l), raloxifene may be associated with a marked increase in serum triglycerides.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
However, modest decreases in the prothrombin time have been observed, and if raloxifene is given concurrently with warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, the prothrombin time should be monitored.
Effects on prothrombin time may develop over several weeks if EVISTA treatment is started in patients who are already on coumarin anticoagulant therapy.
Frequently co-administered medicinal products included: paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen), oral antibiotics, H1 antagonists, H2 antagonists, and benzodiazepines.
Raloxifene should not be co-administered with cholestyramine (or other anion exchange resins), which significantly reduces the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of raloxifene.
However, since the overall extent of absorption and the elimination rate of raloxifene are not affected, raloxifene can be concurrently administered with ampicillin.
Raloxifene modestly increases hormone-binding globulin concentrations, including sex steroid binding globulins (SHBG), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), with corresponding increases in total hormone concentrations.
If this medicinal product is used mistakenly during pregnancy or the patient becomes pregnant while taking it, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus (see section 5.3).
In the prevention population discontinuations of therapy due to any adverse reaction occurred in 10.7% of 581 EVISTA treated patients and 11.1% of 584 placebo-treated patients.
In the treatment population discontinuations of therapy due to any clinical adverse event occurred in 12.8% of 2,557 EVISTA treated patients and 11.1% of 2,576 placebo treated patients.
Venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vein thrombosis Superficial vein thrombophlebitis Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Common:
Across all placebo-controlled clinical trials of raloxifene in osteoporosis, venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis occurred at a frequency of approximately 0.8% or 3.22 cases per 1,000 patient years.
In the RUTH study, venous thromboembolic events occurred at a frequency of approximately 2.0% or 3.88 cases per 1000 patient-years in the raloxifene group and 1.4% or 2.70 cases per 1000 patient-years in the placebo group.
5 Another adverse reaction observed was leg cramps (5.5% for EVISTA, 1.9% for placebo in the prevention population and 9.2% for EVISTA, 6.0% for placebo in the treatment population).
In the RUTH study, leg cramps were observed in 12.1% of raloxifene-treated patients and 8.3% of placebo-treated patients.
This was peripheral oedema, which occurred in the prevention population at an incidence of 3.1% for EVISTA and 1.9% for placebo; and in the treatment population occurred at an incidence of 7.1% for EVISTA and 6.1% for placebo.
In the RUTH study, peripheral oedema occurred in 14.1% of the raloxifene-treated patients and 11.7% of the placebo-treated patients, which was statistically significant.
Slightly decreased (6-10%) platelet counts have been reported during raloxifene treatment in placebo- controlled clinical trials of raloxifene in osteoporosis.
In a study (RUTH) of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events, an additional adverse reaction of cholelithiasis occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with raloxifene and 2.6% of patients treated with placebo.
EVISTA (n = 317) was compared with continuous combined (n = 110) hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or cyclic (n = 205) HRT patients in some clinical trials.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia General disorders and administration site conditions Rare: peripheral oedema Investigations Very rare:
Mild breast symptoms such as pain, enlargement and tenderness Vascular disorders Rare: venous thromboembolic reaction Very rare: arterial thromboembolic reaction
In children, symptoms of accidental overdose included ataxia, dizziness, vomiting, rash, diarrhea, tremor, and flushing, and elevation in alkaline phosphatase.
It acts as an agonist on bone and partially on cholesterol metabolism (decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol), but not in the hypothalamus or in the uterine or breast tissues.
Recent data suggests that the oestrogen receptor can regulate gene expression by at least two distinct pathways which are ligand-, tissue-, and/ or gene-specific.
Bone loss is particularly rapid for the first 10 years after menopause when the compensatory increase in bone formation is inadequate to keep up with resorptive losses.
Other risk factors which may lead to the development of osteoporosis include early menopause; osteopenia (at least 1 SD below peak bone mass); thin body build; Caucasian or Asian ethnic origin; and a family history of osteoporosis.
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, EVISTA reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures, preserves bone mass and increases bone mineral density (BMD).
Based on these risk factors, prevention of osteoporosis with EVISTA is indicated for women within ten years of menopause, with BMD of the spine between 1.0 and 2.5 SD below the mean value of a normal young population, taking into account their high lifetime risk for osteoporotic fractures.
Likewise, EVISTA is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis or established osteoporosis in women with BMD of the spine 2.5 SD below the mean value of a normal young population and/ or with vertebral fractures, irrespective of BMD.
EVISTA treatment for 4 years reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures by 46% (RR 0.54, CI 0.38, 0.75) and 32% (RR 0.68, CI 0.56, 0.83) in patients with osteoporosis or osteoporosis with an existing fracture respectively.
In the 4th year alone, EVISTA reduced the new vertebral fracture risk by 39% (RR 0.61, CI 0.43, 0.88).
From the 4th to the 8th year, patients were permitted the concomitant use of bisphosphonates, calcitonin and fluorides and all patients in this study received calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
The efficacy of EVISTA once daily in postmenopausal women aged up to 60 years and with or without a uterus was established over a two-year treatment period.
In the prevention trials, the percentage of subjects experiencing an increase or decrease in BMD during raloxifene therapy was: for the spine 37% decreased and 63% increased; and for the total hip 29% decreased and 71% increased.
EVISTA was associated with reduced bone resorption and a mean positive shift in calcium balance of 60 mg per day, due primarily to decreased urinary calcium losses.
In a study comparing EVISTA with oestrogen, bone from patients treated with either medicinal product was histologically normal, with no evidence of mineralisation defects, woven bone or marrow fibrosis.
Raloxifene decreases resorption of bone; this effect on bone is manifested as reductions in the serum and urine levels of bone turnover markers, decreases in bone resorption based on radiocalcium kinetics studies, increases in BMD and decreases in the incidence of fractures.
Similarly, in the RUTH study, raloxifene did not affect the incidence of myocardial infarction, hospitalized acute coronary syndrome, stroke or overall mortality, including overall cardiovascular mortality, compared to placebo (for the increase in risk of fatal stroke see section 4.4).
The relative risk of venous thromboembolic events observed during raloxifene treatment was 1.60 (CI 0.95, 2.71) when compared to placebo, and was 1.0 (CI 0.3, 6.2) when compared to oestrogen or
After 3 years of treatment, at least a 5 mm increase in endometrial thickness, assessed with transvaginal ultrasound, was observed in 1.9% of the 211 women treated with raloxifene 60 mg/ day compared to 1.8% of the 219 women who received placebo.
In addition, in a study with 2.5 x the recommended daily dose of EVISTA there was no evidence of endometrial proliferation and no increase in uterine volume.
In the osteoporosis treatment trial, endometrial thickness was evaluated annually in a subset of the study population (1,644 patients) for 4 years.
Safety information following 3 years of raloxifene treatment suggests that raloxifene treatment does not increase pelvic floor relaxation and pelvic floor surgery.
Across all placebo-controlled trials, EVISTA was indistinguishable from placebo with regard to frequency and severity of breast symptoms (no swelling, tenderness and breast pain).
The time to reach average maximum plasma concentration and bioavailability are functions of systemic interconversion and enterohepatic cycling of raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites.
Raloxifene undergoes extensive first pass metabolism to the glucuronide conjugates: raloxifene-4'- glucuronide, raloxifene-6-glucuronide, and raloxifene-6, 4′ -diglucuronide.
The majority of a dose of raloxifene and glucuronide metabolites are excreted within 5 days and are found primarily in the faeces, with less than 6% excreted in urine.
In a population pharmacokinetic study, a 47% decrease in lean body mass adjusted creatinine clearance resulted in a 17% decrease in raloxifene clearance and a 15% decrease in the clearance of raloxifene conjugates.
Hepatic insufficiency - The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of raloxifene in patients with cirrhosis and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) have been compared to that in healthy individuals.
In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, an increase in ovarian tumors of granulosa/ theca cell origin was observed in high-dose females (279 mg/ kg/ day).
Systemic exposure (AUC) of raloxifene in this group was approximately 400 times that in postmenopausal women administered a 60 mg dose.
In a 21-month carcinogenicity study in mice, there was an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell tumours and prostatic adenomas and adenocarcinomas in males given 41 or 210 mg/ kg, and prostatic leiomyoblastoma in males given 210 mg/ kg.
In female mice, an increased incidence of ovarian tumours in animals given 9 to 242 mg/ kg (0.3 to 32 times the AUC in humans) included benign and malignant tumours of granulosa/ theca cell origin and benign tumours of epithelial cell origin.
In contrast to the highly responsive ovaries in this rodent model, the human ovary after menopause is relatively unresponsive to reproductive hormonal stimulation.
When given during the preimplantation period, raloxifene delayed and disrupted embryo implantation resulting in prolonged gestation and reduced litter size but development of offspring to weaning was not affected.
In rabbits, abortion and a low rate of ventricular septal defects (≥ 0.1 mg/ kg) and hydrocephaly (≥ 10 mg/ kg) were seen.
Raloxifene is a potent antioestrogen in the rat uterus and prevented growth of oestrogen-dependent mammary tumours in rats and mice.

Excipients Each 4 mg prolonged-release tablet contains 0.525 mg of soya lecithin and 91.125 mg lactose monohydrate.
Prolonged-release tablets The 4 mg tablets are light blue, oval, biconvex, film-coated, and engraved on one side with the letters ‘ FS’.
Treatment of the symptoms (increased urinary frequency and/ or urgency and/ or urgency incontinence) that may occur in patients with overactive bladder syndrome.
In subjects with normal renal and hepatic function receiving concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, the maximum daily dose of TOVIAZ should be 4 mg once daily (see section 4.5).
During concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, a dose increase to 8 mg should be preceded by an evaluation of the individual response and tolerability (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Renal and hepatic impairment The following table provides the daily dosing recommendations for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment in the absence and presence of moderate and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2).
(1) Mild GFR = 50-80 ml/ min; Moderate GFR = 30-50 ml/ min; Severe GFR = &lt; 30 ml/ min (2) Cautious dose increase.
Paediatric population TOVIAZ is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).
Caution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating fesoterodine to patients in whom an increased exposure to the active metabolite (see section 5.1) is expected:
The concomitant use of fesoterodine with a potent CYP3A4 inducer (i. e. carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St John’ s Wort) is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Fesoterodine may reduce the effect of medicinal products that stimulate the motility of the gastro- intestinal tract, such as metoclopromide.
However, an increase in the exposure of the active metabolite of fesoterodine is expected, although a smaller increase than observed with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine 8 mg.
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers (e. g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St John’ s Wort) is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Mean Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite are 1.7 and 2-fold higher, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers as compared to extensive metabolisers.
In the presence of fesoterodine there are no changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Lactation It is not known whether fesoterodine is excreted into human milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with TOVIAZ.
As with other antimuscarinic agents, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines due to possible occurrence of side effects such as blurred vision, dizziness, and somnolence (see section 4.8).
The safety of fesoterodine was evaluated in placebo-controlled clinical studies in a total of 2859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 780 received placebo.
Due to the pharmacological properties of fesoterodine, treatment may cause mild to moderate antimuscarinic effects like dry mouth, dry eye, dyspepsia and constipation.
Dry mouth, the only very common event, occurred with a frequency of 28.8% in the fesoterodine group compared to 8.5% in the placebo group.
The adverse reactions reported in this table are those events that were very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to &lt; 1/ 10) or uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to &lt; 1/ 100).
Electrocardiograms were obtained from 782 patients treated with 4 mg, 785 treated with 8 mg, 222 treated with 12 mg fesoterodine and 780 with placebo.
The incidence rates of QTc ≥ 500 ms post baseline or QTc increase of ≥ 60 ms is 1.9%, 1.3%, 1.4% and 1.5%, for fesoterodine 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg and placebo, respectively.
Convulsions or pronounced excitation: treat with benzodiazepines Respiratory insufficiency: treat with artificial respiration Tachycardia: treat with beta-blockers Urinary retention: treat with catheterisation Mydriasis: treat with pilocarpine eye drops and/ or place patient in dark room.
It is rapidly and extensively hydrolysed by non-specific plasma esterases to the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, its primary active metabolite, which is the main active pharmacological principle of fesoterodine.
The efficacy of fixed doses of fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg was evaluated in two Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies.
Fesoterodine treated patients had statistically significant mean reductions in the number of micturitions per 24 hours and in the number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours at the end of treatment compared to placebo.
Likewise, the response rate (% of patients reporting that their condition has been “ greatly improved” or “ improved” using a 4-point Treatment Benefit Scale) was significantly greater with fesoterodine compared to placebo.
Furthermore, fesoterodine improved the mean change in the voided volume per micturition, and the mean change in the number of continent days per week (see Table 1 below).
After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose.
Renal impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 – 80 ml/ min), Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite increased up to 1.5 and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects.
In patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 ml/ min), Cmax and AUC are increased 2.0 and 2.3- fold, respectively.
Hepatic impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite increased 1.4 and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects.
In non-clinical safety pharmacology, general toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies no clinically relevant effects have been observed, except those related to the pharmacological effect of the active substance.
Reproduction studies have shown minor embryotoxicity at doses close to maternally toxic ones (increased number of resorptions, pre-implantation and post-implantation losses).
Supratherapeutic concentrations of the active metabolite of fesoterodine, have been shown to inhibit K+ current in cloned human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels and prolong action potential duration (70% and 90% repolarisation) in canine isolated Purkinje fibres.

TOVIAZ treats the symptoms of an overactive bladder such as • not being able to control when you empty your bladder (called urgency incontinence) • suddenly needing to empty your bladder (called urgency) • having to empty your bladder more than usual (called increased urinary frequency)
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines you do not have a prescription for.
Concomitant treatment with fesoterodine may make side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, difficulty in completely emptying your bladder or drowsiness more serious or occur more often.
John’ s Wort (herbal medicinal product), rifampicin (used to treat bacterial infections), carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital (used, among others, to treat epilepsy)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding You should not take TOVIAZ if you are pregnant, as the effects of fesoterodine on pregnancy and the unborn baby are not known.
It is not known whether fesoterodine is excreted into human milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with TOVIAZ.
If you take more TOVIAZ than you should If you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes your tablets, contact your doctor or hospital for advice immediately.
If you forget to take TOVIAZ If you forget to take a tablet, take your tablet as soon as you remember, but do not take more than one tablet in one day.
If you stop taking TOVIAZ Do not stop taking TOVIAZ without talking to your doctor, as your symptoms of overactive bladder may come back again or become worse once you stop taking TOVIAZ.

TOVIAZ is used in patients with overactive bladder syndrome to treat the symptoms of the disease: increased urinary frequency (need to urinate frequently), urgency (sudden urge to pass urine), and urgency incontinence (sudden lack of control over urination).
The dose of TOVIAZ must be adjusted, or the medicine not used, in patients with problems with their kidneys or liver, especially when they are also receiving at the same time other medicines that may affect the way TOVIAZ is broken down in the body.
It blocks some receptors in the body, the muscarinic receptors, and in the bladder, this causes the muscles that push urine out of the bladder to relax.
TOVIAZ was more effective than placebo and as effective as tolterodine in reducing the number of times the patients urinated in a 24-hour period.
This number was decreased by 1.74 or 1.86 (4 mg dose) and by 1.94 (8 mg dose) after 12 weeks on TOVIAZ, and by 1.02 in patients receiving placebo.
TOVIAZ should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to fesoterodine, to peanut, to soya or to any of the other ingredients.
TOVIAZ should not be given to patients with moderate liver or moderate to severe kidney disease at the same time as other medicines which have a strong blocking effect on one of the liver enzymes (CYP3A4).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that TOVIAZ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of the symptoms (increased urinary frequency and/ or urgency and/ or urgency incontinence) that may occur in patients with overactive bladder syndrome.
Preotact is used for the treatment of osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of fractures.
The recommended dose is 100 micrograms of Preotact given once daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) into the abdomen (tummy).
It is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: the hormone is made by a bacterium that has received a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce it.
The bone density was also the main measure in another study, which looked at the use of Preotact with or without alendronate (a biphosphonate).
The risk reduction was higher in women who already had a fractured vertebra in the past, and in women whose score for spine bone density was already low at the start of the study, indicating that they have a more fragile spine.
The most common side effects are hypercalcaemia (increased blood calcium), hypercalciuria (increased urine calcium), and nausea (feeling sick).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Preotact’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures.
Hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (total score of 7 to 9 on the Child-Pugh scale).
Serum calcium concentrations reach a maximum between 6 and 8 hours post dose and normally return to baseline by 20 to 24 hours after each administration of parathyroid hormone.
Management of elevated serum calcium Patients with persistent elevated serum calcium (above the upper normal level) should be evaluated for underlying disease (e. g. hyperparathyroidism).
Calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be withdrawn The frequency of Preotact dosing should be changed to 100 micrograms every other day If elevated levels continue, Preotact therapy should be stopped and the patient monitored until the abnormal values have reverted to normal
Patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria Preotact has been studied in patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria.
The occurrence of osteosarcoma only occurred at doses that produced systemic exposures &gt; 27-times higher than that observed in humans at the 100 micrograms dose.
Parathyroid hormone is a natural peptide that is not metabolised by, and does not inhibit hepatic microsomal drug-metabolising enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450 isoenzymes).
Combining parathyroid hormone with alendronate use has not been shown to provide any advantage over either form of treatment alone, when the end point of bone mineral density was evaluated.
From the knowledge of the mechanism of action, combined use of Preotact and cardiac glucosides may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops.
As some episodes of dizziness have been described in patients treated with Preotact, patients should refrain from driving or using machines until symptoms have subsided.
The following adverse reaction (ADR) data are based on two placebo-controlled studies involving 2642 postmenopausal osteoporotic women of whom 1341 received parathyroid hormone.
Hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria reflect the known pharmacodynamic actions of parathyroid hormone in the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney, and the bone.
It was managed during the clinical programme by monitoring laboratory values and the use of a pre-specified management algorithm (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.1).
4 The table below gives an overview of the ADRs where the incidence is at least 0.5% higher in the parathyroid hormone group compared to placebo.
General disorders and administration site conditions Common Injection site erythema 2.6 Fatigue 1.8 Asthenia 1.2 Uncommon Injection site irritation 0.9
For all subjects who received parathyroid hormone 100 micrograms blood uric acid increase was reported for 8 subjects (0.6%) and hyperuricemia was reported for 5 subjects (0.4%).
Although gout, arthralgia and nephrolithiasis were reported as ADRs, the relationship to elevations in uric acid due to Preotact administration has not been fully established.
Antibodies to parathyroid hormone In a large phase III clinical study, antibodies to parathyroid hormone were detected in 3% of women receiving Preotact compared to 0.2% of women receiving placebo.
In these women with a positive titer, there was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic reactions, effects on bone mineral density response, or effects on serum calcium.
Preotact has been administered in single doses up to 5 micrograms/kg and in repeated doses of up to 3 micrograms/kg/day for 3 days and up to 2.5 micrograms/kg/day for 7 days.
Treatment of suspected overdose should include temporary discontinuation of Preotact, monitoring of serum calcium, and implementation of appropriate, supportive measures, such as hydration.
Physiological actions of parathyroid hormone include stimulation of bone formation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and increasing the tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney.
Transient elevations in parathyroid hormone levels after subcutaneous injection of Preotact stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity.
In response to subcutaneous doses of Preotact (100 micrograms parathyroid hormone), serum total calcium levels increase gradually and reach peak concentration (mean increase in 129 patients, 0.15 mmol/l) at approximately 6 to 8 hours after dosing.
Based on two placebo-controlled studies involving 2642 postmenopausal osteoporotic women, hypercalcemia was reported in 25.3% of patients treated with Preotact compared to 4.3% of placebo- treated patients.
Clinical efficacy Effect on fracture incidence The pivotal study was an 18-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study (TOP) of the effect of Preotact on fracture incidence in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Patients in the Preotact treatment group had a 61% relative risk reduction of a new vertebral fracture at month 18 compared to the patients in the placebo group.
The most relevant fracture reduction was observed among patients at high risk of fractures such as patients with previous fractures and in patients with a lumbar spine T-score of &lt; - 3.
Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the pivotal study, Preotact increased BMD in the lumbar spine after 18 months treatment by 6.5% compared with -0.3% for placebo (p &lt; 0.001).
Significant increases in hip BMD (total, femoral neck, trochanter) were observed at study endpoint; 1.0, 1.8 and 1.0%, respectively, for Preotact versus -1.1, -0. 7 and -0.6% for placebo (p &lt; 0.001).
The increase from baseline in lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD was 6.8% and 2.2%, respectively in patients treated with Preotact.
Treatment with Preotact reduced volumetric cortical bone BMD (measured at the distal radius and mid-shaft tibia), while periosteal circumference or indices of cortical bone strength were maintained.
Volumetric trabecular BMD at the lumbar spine increased by 26, 13, and 11% (Preotact, Preotact and alendronate and alendronate, respectively) over baseline at 12 months.
Inclusion criterias were; women between 55 and 85 years of age with BMD T-scores below -2.5 or below -2 and at least one additional risk factor for fracture.
A total of 238 postmenopausal women, were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups; Preotact (100 micrograms parathyroid hormone), alendronate (10 mg), or the combination of both, and followed for 12 months.
In the second year of the study women in the original Preotact group were randomly assigned to receive either alendronate or matching placebo, and women in the other two groups received alendronate.
At baseline a total of 165 women (69%) had a T-score below –2.5, and 112 (47%) reported at least one fracture after menopause.
The increases in lumbar spine BMD above baseline were similar in the Preotact and combination-therapy groups (6.3 and 6.1%, respectively), but were somewhat smaller in the alendronate group (4.6%).
At the end of year 2 (12 months after Preotact was discontinued), there was a 12.1% mean increase in dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) spine BMD for patients who received alendronate for the second year.
For the patients who received placebo during the second year, the mean percent increase was 4.1% compared to baseline, but had decreased slightly compared to the end of 12 months of Preotact treatment.
For the mean change in hip BMD, there was a 4.5% increase from baseline with one year of alendronate compared to a 0.1% decrease after one year of placebo.
Preotact in combination with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in 180 postmenopausal women has been shown to significantly increase lumbar spine BMD at 12 months compared with HRT alone (7.1% vs.
Absorption Subcutaneous administration of 100 micrograms of parathyroid hormone into the abdomen produces a rapid increase in plasma parathyroid hormone levels and achieves a peak at 1 to 2 hours after dosing.
The fragments derived from the amino-terminus are further degraded within the cell while the fragments derived from the carboxy-terminius are released back into the blood and cleared by the kidney.
Under normal physiologic conditions, full-length parathyroid hormone (1-84) constitutes only 5-30% of the circulating forms of the molecule, while 70-95% is present as carboxy-terminal fragments.
Systemic clearance of parathyroid hormone (45.3 l/hour) following an intravenous dose is close to normal liver plasma flow and is consistent with extensive hepatic metabolism of the active substance.
Hepatic impairment There was a modest increase of about 20% in the mean baseline corrected exposure (AUC) to parathyroid hormone in a study conducted in 6 men and 6 women with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with a matched group of 12 subjects with normal hepatic function.
The pharmacokinetics of parathyroid hormone in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min) has not been investigated.
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, mutagenicity, toxicity to fertility and general reproduction, and local tolerance.
9 Rats treated with near life-time daily injections had dose-dependent exaggerated bone formation and an increased incidence of bone tumours, including osteosarcoma, most probably due to an epigenetic mechanism.

In the case of Ytracis, the product is used to label medicines that have been specially developed for use with the active ingredient yttrium (90Y) chloride.
The 90Y contained in Ytracis then attaches itself to the carrier medicine and the resulting mixture is given according to the instructions in the Package Leaflet of the carrier medicine.
The quantity of Ytracis needed for radiolabelling and the quantity of the radiolabelled medicine that is given will depend on the medicine that is radiolabelled and the disease that is being treated.
An example of its use is the treatment of some types of tumours, where the radiolabelled medicine carries the radioactivity to the site of a tumour.
Medicines radiolabelled with Ytracis should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to yttrium chloride or any of the other ingredients.
More information on the restrictions for the medicines radiolabelled with Ytracis will be given in the Package Leaflet of the particular medicine that is radiolabelled with Ytracis.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Ytracis’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide.
1ml of sterile solution contains 1.850 GBq Yttrium (90Y) chloride, at the date of calibration, corresponding to 92 ng of Yttrium.
To be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules which have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide.
The quantity of YTRACIS required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product radiolabelled and its intended use.
For information on contraindications to particular Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with YTRACIS, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
The content of the vial of YTRACIS is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates.
Radioactive medicinal products should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings and receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and appropriate licences of the competent authorities.
For information concerning special warnings and precautions for use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
For information concerning interactions associated with the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
The absorbed dose to the uterus following administration of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products is dependent on the specific medicinal product being radiolabelled and is to be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
Before administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to whether the administration could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breastfeeding.
For information concerning the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy and lactation refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
Effects on ability to drive or use machines following treatment by Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
Possible side effects following the intravenous administration of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with YTRACIS, will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used.
The presence of free Yttrium (90Y) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Ytracis will lead to increase bone marrow toxicity and haematopoetic stem cell damage.
Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate)
These chelating agents suppress yttrium radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the yttrium due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA).
1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3-4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100-250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline).
The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma.
The toxicity of the free Yttrium (90Y) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents
The pharmacodynamic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with YTRACIS, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
The pharmacokinetic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with YTRACIS, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
The toxicological properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with YTRACIS prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
There are no data available on the toxicity of Yttrium (90Y) chloride nor on its effects on reproduction in animals or its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential.
Radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, with Yttrium (90Y) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities.
It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc, used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities.
Only syringe needles (for example non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimise trace metal impurity levels.
1 vial contains 0.5 to 2 ml (corresponding to 0.925 to 3.700 GBq calibrated three or four days after the manufacturing date) depending on the ordered radioactivity.
The radiation dose received by the various organs following administration of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product will be dependent on the specific pharmaceutical being radiolabelled.
Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the radiolabelled preparation will be available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
The dosimetry table below is presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated Yttrium (90Y) to the radiation dose following the administration of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product or resulting from an accidental intravenous injection of YTRACIS.
For this product, the effective dose resulting from an intravenously injected activity of 1 GBq is 700 mSv for a 57-kg female adult and 650 mSv for a 70-kg male adult.
Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying with the requirements of Good Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Practice, in order to maintain the sterility of YTRACIS and to maintain sterility throughout the labelling procedures.

Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs such as hip fracture, major knee surgery or hip replacement surgery.
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are judged to be at high risk of thromboembolic complications, such as patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery (see section 5.1).
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in medical patients who are judged to be at high risk for VTE and who are immobilised due to acute illness such as cardiac insufficiency and/ or acute respiratory disorders, and/ or acute infectious or inflammatory disease.
Patients undergoing major orthopaedic or abdominal surgery The recommended dose of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg once daily administered post-operatively by subcutaneous injection.
Treatment should be continued until the risk of venous thrombo-embolism has diminished, usually until the patient is ambulant, at least 5 to 9 days after surgery.
In these patients the use of prolonged prophylaxis with fondaparinux should be considered for up to an additional 24 days (see section 5.1).
Medical patients who are at high risk for thromboembolic complications based on an individual risk assessment The recommended dose of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg once daily administered by subcutaneous injection.
2 Special populations In patients undergoing surgery, timing of the first fondaparinux injection requires strict adherence in patients ≥ 75 years, and/ or with body weight &lt; 50 kg and/ or with renal impairment with creatinine clearance ranging between 20 to 50 ml/ min.
The dose should be reduced to 1.5 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance in the range of 20 to 50 ml/ min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, fondaparinux should be used with care as this patient group has not been studied (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
To avoid the loss of medicinal product when using the pre-filled syringe do not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection.
The whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between the thumb and the forefinger; the skin fold should be held throughout the injection.
These agents include desirudin, fibrinolytic agents, GP IIb/ IIIa receptor antagonists, heparin, heparinoids, or Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH).
Other antiplatelet medicinal products (acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, ticlopidine or clopidogrel), and NSAIDs should be used with caution.
3 Spinal / Epidural anaesthesia In patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery, epidural or spinal haematomas that may result in long-term or permanent paralysis cannot be excluded with the concurrent use of fondaparinux and spinal/ epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture.
The risk of these rare events may be higher with post- operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of other medicinal products affecting haemostasis.
Patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/ min are at increased risk of bleeding and VTE and should be treated with caution (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).
However, the use of fondaparinux should be considered with caution because of an increased risk of bleeding due to a deficiency of coagulation factors in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Fondaparinux does not bind to platelet factor 4 and does not cross-react with sera from patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II.
Bleeding risk is increased with concomitant administration of fondaparinux and agents that may enhance the risk of haemorrhage (see section 4.4).
Oral anticoagulants (warfarin), platelet inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid), NSAIDs (piroxicam) and digoxin did not interact with the pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux.
Fondaparinux neither influenced the INR activity of warfarin, nor the bleeding time under acetylsalicylic acid or piroxicam treatment, nor the pharmacokinetics of digoxin at steady state.
Follow-up therapy with another anticoagulant medicinal product If follow-up treatment is to be initiated with heparin or LMWH, the first injection should, as a general rule, be given one day after the last fondaparinux injection.
Common: post-operative haemorrhage, anaemia Uncommon: bleeding (epistaxis, gastrointestinal, haemoptysis, haematuria, haematoma) thrombocytopenia, purpura, thrombocythaemia, platelet abnormal, coagulation disorder
Gastrointestinal Uncommon: nausea, vomiting disorders Rare: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastritis, constipation, diarrhoea
Uncommon: oedema, oedema peripheral, fever, wound secretion Rare: chest pain, fatigue, hot flushes, leg pain, oedema genital, flushing, syncope
In other studies or in post-marketing experience, rare cases of intracranial / intracerebral and retroperitoneal bleedings have been reported.
The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux is the result of antithrombin III (ATIII) mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa.
Over 8,000 patients (hip fracture – 1,711, hip replacement – 5,829, major knee surgery – 1,367) were studied in controlled Phase II and III clinical studies.
Fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily started 6-8 hours postoperatively was compared with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours before surgery, or 30 mg twice daily started 12-24 hours after surgery.
In a pooled analysis of these studies, the recommended dose regimen of fondaparinux versus enoxaparin was associated with a significant decrease (54% [95% CI, 44%; 63%]) in the rate of VTE evaluated up to day 11 after surgery, irrespective of the type of surgery performed.
The majority of endpoint events were diagnosed by a prescheduled venography and consisted mainly of distal DVT, but the incidence of proximal DVT was also significantly reduced.
In studies versus enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours before surgery, major bleeding was observed in 2.8% of fondaparinux patients treated with the recommended dose, compared to 2.6% with enoxaparin.
At the end of this period, 656 patients were randomised to receive fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily or placebo for an additional 21 +/ - 2 days.
Fondaparinux provided a significant reduction in the overall rate of VTE compared with placebo [3 patients (1.4%) vs 77 patients (35%), respectively].
Fondaparinux also provided a significant reduction in the rate of symptomatic VTE (DVT, and / or PE) [1 (0.3%) vs 9 (2.7%) patients, respectively] including two fatal PE reported in the placebo group.
Major bleedings, all at surgical site and none fatal, were observed in 8 patients (2.4%) treated with fondaparinux 2.5 mg compared to 2 (0.6%) with placebo.
Patients under-going urological (other than kidney) or gynaecological surgery, laparoscopic surgery or vascular surgery were not included in the study.
(62/ 1,021) with dalteparin: odds ratio reduction [95%CI] = -25.8% [-49.7%, 9.5%].
In the large subgroup of patients undergoing cancer surgery (69% of the patient population), the VTE rate was 4.7% in the fondaparinux group, versus 7.7% in the dalteparin group.
This study included acutely ill medical patients, aged ≥ 60 years, expected to require bed rest for at least four days, and hospitalized for congestive heart failure NYHA class III/ IV and/ or acute respiratory illness and/ or acute infectious or inflammatory disease.
Fondaparinux significantly reduced the overall rate of VTE compared to placebo [18 patients (5.6%) vs 34 patients (10.5%), respectively].
Fondaparinux also significantly reduced the rate of adjudicated fatal PE [0 patients (0.0%) vs 5 patients (1.2%), respectively].
Following a single subcutaneous injection of fondaparinux 2.5 mg to young healthy subjects, peak plasma concentration (mean Cmax = 0.34 mg/ l) is obtained 2 hours post-dosing.
Following once daily dosing, steady state of plasma levels is obtained after 3 to 4 days with a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax and AUC.
Mean (CV%) steady state pharmacokinetic parameters estimates of fondaparinux in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery receiving fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily are:
Cmax (mg/ l) - 0.39 (31%), Tmax (h) - 2.8 (18%) and Cmin (mg/ l) -0.14 (56%).
In vitro, fondaparinux is highly and specifically bound to antithrombin protein with a dose-dependant plasma concentration binding (98.6% to 97.0% in the concentration range from 0.5 to 2 mg/ l).
Fondaparinux does not inhibit CYP450s (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4) in vitro.
In patients &gt; 75 years undergoing orthopaedic surgery, the estimated plasma clearance was 1.2 to 1.4 times lower than in patients &lt; 65 years.
The lower plasma concentrations of fondaparinux were attributed to reduced binding to ATIII secondary to the lower ATIII plasma concentrations in subjects with hepatic impairment thereby resulting in increased renal clearance of fondaparinux.
Consequently, unbound concentrations of fondaparinux are expected to be unchanged in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary based on pharmacokinetics.
Type I glass barrel (1 ml) affixed with a 27 gauge x 12.7 mm needle and stoppered with a bromobutyl or chlorobutyl elastomer plunger stopper.
There are two types of syringes: • syringe with a yellow plunger and an automatic safety system • syringe with yellow plunger and a manual safety system.

Treatment of unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/ NSTEMI) in patients for whom urgent (&lt; 120 mins) invasive management (PCI) is not indicated (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Treatment of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients who are managed with thrombolytics or who initially are to receive no other form of reperfusion therapy.
12 Medical patients who are at high risk for thromboembolic complications based on an individual risk assessment The recommended dose of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg once daily administered by subcutaneous injection.
Treatment of unstable angina/ non- ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/ NSTEMI) The recommended dose of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg once daily, administered by subcutaneous injection.
If a patient is to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), unfractionated heparin (UFH) as per local practice should be administered during PCI, taking into account the patient’ s potential risk of bleeding, including the time since the last dose of fondaparinux (see section 4.4).
If a patient is to undergo non-primary PCI, unfractionated heparin (UFH) as per local practice should be administered during PCI, taking into account the patient’ s potential risk of bleeding, including the time since the last dose of fondaparinux (see section 4.4).
In STEMI or UA/ NSTEMI patients who are to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, fondaparinux where possible, should not be given during the 24 hours before surgery and may be restarted 48 hours post-operatively.
Prevention of VTE following Surgery In patients undergoing surgery, timing of the first fondaparinux injection requires strict adherence in patients ≥ 75 years, and/ or with body weight &lt; 50 kg and/ or with renal impairment with creatinine clearance ranging between 20 to 50 ml/ min.
Renal impairment • Prophylaxis of VTE - Fondaparinux should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/ min (see section 4.3).
• Treatment of UA/ NSTEMI and STEMI - fondaparinux should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/ min (see section 4.3).
• Intravenous administration (first dose in patients with STEMI only) Intravenous administration should be through an existing intravenous line either directly or using a small volume (25 or 50ml) 0.9% saline minibag.
For treatment of UA/ NSTEMI and STEMI, fondaparinux should be used with caution in patients who are being treated concomitantly with other agents that increase the risk of haemorrhage (such as GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitors or thrombolytics).
14 PCI and risk of guiding catheter thrombus In STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, the use of fondaparinux prior to and during PCI is not recommended.
Similarly, in UA/ NSTEMI patients with life threatening conditions that require urgent revascularisation, the use of fondaparinux prior to and during PCI is not recommended.
These are patients with refractory or recurrent angina associated with dynamic ST deviation, heart failure, life- threatening arrhythmias or haemodynamic instability.
In UA/ NSTEMI and STEMI patients undergoing non-primary PCI, the use of fondaparinux as the sole anticoagulant during PCI is not recommended, therefore UFH should be used according to local practice (see section 4.2).
In those patients who underwent non-primary PCI 6-24 hours after the last dose of fondaparinux, the median dose of UFH was 8,000 IU and the incidence of major bleeding was 2% (2/ 98).
In those patients who underwent non-primary PCI &lt; 6 hours after the last dose of fondaparinux, the median dose of UFH was 5,000 IU and the incidence of major bleeding was 4.1% (2/ 49).
Clinical trials have shown a low but increased risk of guiding catheter thrombus in patients treated with fondaparinux for anticoagulation during PCI compared to control.
Incidences in non-primary PCI in UA/ NSTEMI were 1.0% vs 0.3% (fondaparinux vs. enoxaparin) and in primary PCI in STEMI were 1.2% vs 0% (fondaparinux vs. control).
Spinal / Epidural anaesthesia In patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery, epidural or spinal haematomas that may result in long-term or permanent paralysis cannot be excluded with the concurrent use of fondaparinux and spinal/ epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture.
• Prophylaxis of VTE - Patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/ min are at increased risk of bleeding and VTE and should be treated with caution (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).
• Treatment of UA/ NSTEMI and STEMI - For the treatment of UA/ NSTEMI and STEMI, there are limited clinical data available on the use of fondaparinux 2.5mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance between 20 and 30 ml/ min.
Uncommon: bleeding (epistaxis, gastrointestinal, haemoptysis, haematuria, haematoma) thrombocytopenia, purpura, thrombocythaemia, platelet abnormal, coagulation disorder
4.1% (enoxaparin) up to and including Day 9 in the Phase III UA/ NSTEMI study, and the incidence of adjudicated severe haemorrhage by modified TIMI criteria was 1.1% (fondaparinux) vs.
In the Phase III UA/ NSTEMI study, the most commonly reported non-bleeding adverse events (reported in at least 1% of subjects on fondaparinux) were headache, chest pain and atrial fibrillation.
In the Phase III study in STEMI patients, the most commonly reported non-bleeding adverse events (reported in at least 1% of subjects on fondaparinux) were atrial fibrillation, pyrexia, chest pain, headache, ventricular tachycardia, vomiting, and hypotension.
If PCI was performed, patients received either intravenous fondaparinux (fondaparinux patients) or weight adjusted intravenous UFH (enoxaparin patients) as adjunctive therapy, dependent on the timing of the last subcutaneous dose and planned use of GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitor.
Approximately 40% and 17% of patients had mild (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 to &lt; 80 ml/ min) or moderate (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to &lt; 50 ml/ min) renal impairment, respectively.
The primary adjudicated endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and refractory ischaemia (RI) within 9 days of randomisation.
Of the patients in the fondaparinux group, 5.8% experienced an event by Day 9 compared to 5.7% for enoxaparin-treated patients (hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI, 0.90, 1.13, one-sided non-inferiority p value = 0.003).
By Day 30, the incidence of all cause mortality was significantly reduced from 3.5% on enoxaparin to 2.9% on fondaparinux (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI, 0.71; 0.97, p = 0.02).
At Day 9 the incidence of major bleeding on fondaparinux and enoxaparin was 2.1% and 4.1%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI, 0.44; 0.61, p &lt; 0.001).
The efficacy findings and results on major bleeding were consistent across prespecified subgroups such as elderly, renally impaired patients, type of concomitant platelet aggregation inhibitors (aspirin, thienopyridines or GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitors).
In the subgroup of patients treated with fondaparinux or enoxaparin who underwent PCI, 8.8% and 8.2% of patients respectively, experience death/ MI/ RI within 9 days of randomisation (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI, 0.92; 1.27).
In this subgroup, the incidence of major bleeding on fondaparinux and enoxaparin at Day 9 was 2.2% and 5.0% respectively (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% CI, 0.33; 0.57).
Approximately 40% and 14% of patients had mild (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 to &lt; 80 ml/ min) or moderate (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to &lt; 50 ml/ min) renal impairment, respectively.
The incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 was significantly reduced from 11.1% for the control group to 9.7% for the fondaparinux group (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI, 0.77, 0.96, p = 0.008).
The incidence of all cause mortality at Day 30 was also significantly reduced from 8.9% for the control group to 7.8% in the fondaparinux group (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI, 0.77; 0.98, p = 0.02).
Among patients initially not reperfused, the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 was significantly reduced from 15% for the control group to 12.1% for the fondaparinux group (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI, 0.65; 0.97, p = 0.023).
In patients treated with primary PCI, the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 was not statistically different between the two groups [6.0% in fondaparinux group vs 4.8% in the control group; hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI, 0.96, 1.66].
The efficacy findings and results on severe haemorrhage were consistent across prespecified subgroups such as elderly, renally impaired patients, type of concomitant platelet aggregation inhibitors (aspirin, thienopyridines).
Following once daily subcutaneous dosing, steady state of plasma levels is obtained after 3 to 4 days with a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax and AUC.
21 Mean (CV%) steady state pharmacokinetic parameters estimates of fondaparinux in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery receiving fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily are:
If fondaparinux sodium is added to a 0.9% saline minibag it should ideally be infused immediately, but can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
There are two types of syringes: • syringe with a blue plunger and an automatic safety system • syringe with blue plunger and a manual safety system.
Intravenous administration should be through an existing intravenous line either directly or using a small volume (25 or 50ml) 0.9% saline minibag.

Treatment of acute Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and treatment of acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE), except in haemodynamically unstable patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.
The recommended dose of fondaparinux is 7.5 mg (patients with body weight ≥ 50, ≤ 100kg) once daily administered by subcutaneous injection.
There is no experience in the subgroup of patients with both high body weight (&gt; 100 kg) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/ min).
In this subgroup, after an initial 10 mg daily dose, a reduction of the daily dose to 7.5 mg may be considered, based on pharmacokinetic modelling (see section 4.4).
There is limited experience from treatment with fondaparinux in haemodynamically unstable patients and no experience in patients requiring thrombolysis, embolectomy or insertion of a vena cava filter.
As for other anticoagulants, fondaparinux should be used with caution in patients who have undergone recent surgery (&lt; 3 days) and only once surgical haemostasis has been established.
Spinal / Epidural anaesthesia In patients receiving fondaparinux for treatment of VTE rather than prophylaxis, spinal/ epidural anaesthesia in case of surgical procedures should not be used.
Incidences of bleeding events in patients receiving the recommended regimen in the treatment of DVT or PE and aged&lt; 65 years, 65-75 and &gt; 75 years were 3.0%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively.
Fondaparinux is contra-indicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/ min) and should be used with caution in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/ min).
After an initial 10 mg daily dose, a reduction of the daily dose to 7.5 mg may be considered, based on pharmacokinetic modelling (see section 4.2).
Severe hepatic impairment The use of fondaparinux should be considered with caution because of an increased risk of bleeding due to a deficiency of coagulation factors in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Platelet inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid), NSAIDs (piroxicam) and digoxin did not interact with the pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux.
At the 10 mg dose used in the interaction studies, fondaparinux did not influence the bleeding time under acetylsalicylic acid or piroxicam treatment, nor the pharmacokinetics of digoxin at steady state.
The safety of fondaparinux has been evaluated in 2,517 patients treated for Venous Thrombo- Embolism and treated with fondaparinux for an average of 7 days.
The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux is the result of antithrombin III (antithrombin) mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa.
By binding selectively to antithrombin, fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by antithrombin.
At the 10 mg dose used in interaction studies, fondaparinux did not significantly influence the anticoagulation activity (INR) of warfarin.
The fondaparinux clinical program in treatment of Venous Thromboembolism was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of fondaparinux for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
A total of 2,192 patients were treated; for both groups, patients were treated for at least 5 days and up to 26 days (mean 7 days).
Both treatment groups received Vitamin K antagonist therapy usually initiated within 72 hours after the first study drug administration and continued for 90 ± 7 days, with regular dose adjustments to achieve an INR of 2-3.
Treatment with fondaparinux was demonstrated to be non-inferior to enoxaparin (VTE rates 3.9% and 4.1%, respectively).
Randomised patients could have been pre-treated with UFH during the screening phase but patients treated for more than 24 hours with therapeutic dose of anticoagulant or with uncontrolled hypertension were excluded.
A total of 2,184 patients were treated; for both groups, patients were treated for at least 5 days and up to 22 days (mean 7 days).
Treatment with fondaparinux was demonstrated to be non-inferior to unfractionated heparin (VTE rates 3.8% and 5.0%, respectively).
30 Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was observed in 1.3% of fondaparinux patients, compared to 1.1% with unfractionated heparin.
Only fondaparinux can be used to calibrate the anti-Xa assay (the international standards of heparin or LMWH are not appropriate for this use).
In DVT and PE treatment, patients receiving fondaparinux 5 mg (body weight&lt; 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50- 100 kg inclusive) and 10 mg (body weight &gt; 100 kg) once daily, the body weight-adjusted doses provide similar exposure across all body weight categories.
The mean (CV%) steady state pharmacokinetic parameters estimates of fondaparinux in patients with VTE receiving the fondaparinux proposed dose regimen once daily are:
Cmax (mg/ l) - 1.41 (23%), Tmax (h) – 2.4 (8%) and Cmin (mg/ l) -0.52 (45%).
The associated 5th and 95th percentiles are, respectively, 0.97 and 1.92 for Cmax (mg/ l), and 0.24 and 0.95 for Cmin (mg/ l).
Since fondaparinux does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than antithrombin, no interaction with other medicinal products by protein binding displacement are expected.
In patients &gt; 75 years undergoing orthopaedic surgery and receiving fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily, the estimated plasma clearance was 1.2 to 1.4 times lower than in patients &lt; 65 years.

What Arixtra contains The active substance is: • 5 mg fondaparinux sodium in 0.4 ml solution for injection • 7.5 mg fondaparinux sodium in 0.6 ml solution for injection • 10 mg fondaparinux sodium in 0.8 ml solution for injection
98 Types of safety syringe There are two types of safety syringes used for Arixtra, designed to protect you from needle stick injuries following injection.
Remove the syringe from the carton and check that: • the expiry date has not passed • the solution is clear and colourless to slightly yellow and doesn’ t contain particles
Remove the needle guard, by first twisting it (picture B1), and then pulling it in a straight line away from the body of the syringe (picture B2).
Arixtra contains the active substance fondaparinux sodium (1.5, 2.5, 5, 7.5 or 10 mg per syringe).
Arixtra (1.5 and 2.5 mg strengths) is used to prevent venous thromboembolic events (VTEs, problems caused by blood clots) in patients who are having major surgery to their legs, such as a hip replacement or surgery to repair a knee or hip fracture.
It can also be used in patients at high risk (because of their age or disease) when they have abdominal surgery, especially for cancer, or when they are forced to stay in bed because of an acute illness.
At higher strengths (5, 7.5 and 10 mg), Arixtra is used to treat VTEs such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT, a blood clot in the leg) or pulmonary embolism (PE, blood clot in the lung).
In the prevention of VTEs, the recommended dose of Arixtra is 2.5 mg once a day by subcutaneous injection (under the skin).
For patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily by subcutaneous injection, but the first dose is given intravenously (into a vein) through an existing line or as an infusion (drip) in patients with ST segment elevation.
Treatment should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis and continued for up to eight days or until the patient is 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
The active ingredient in Arixtra, fondaparinux sodium, stops one of the substances (factors) that are involved in the clotting of blood, Factor Xa.
By reducing blood clots, Arixtra can also help the flow of blood to the heart to be maintained in patients with angina or who are having a heart attack.
In the prevention studies, Arixtra was compared with other anticoagulants: enoxaparin (in hip or knee surgery; over 8,000 patients) or dalteparin (in abdominal surgery; 2,927 patients).
It was also compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) when looking at patients with an acute illness (839 patients) and patients treated for an additional 24 days following hip fracture surgery (656 patients).
The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of patients who died or had an ‘ ischaemic event’ (restriction of blood supply to an organ, including the heart).
The overall rate of thrombotic events in patients treated with Arixtra was significantly less than in patients treated with placebo or enoxaparin (for patients undergoing leg surgery), and was similar to that seen with enoxaparin (treatment of DVT), dalteparin or unfractionated heparin.
Arixtra was at least as effective as enoxaparin in preventing death or an ischaemic event in patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction without ST segment elevation, with around 5% of the patients in each group had died or had an ischaemic event after nine days.
In the study of myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation, Arixtra reduced the risk of death or another heart attack by 14% after 30 days, compared to standard care.
Arixtra should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to fondaparinux sodium or any of the other ingredients, who might be bleeding already, who have acute bacterial endocarditis (an infection of the heart) or have severe kidney problems.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Arixtra’ s benefits are greater than its risks in both the prevention and the treatment of VTEs, unstable angina and myocardial infarction.
Busilvex followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in adult patients when the combination is considered the best available option.
Busilvex followed by cyclophosphamide (BuCy4) or melphalan (BuMel) is indicated as conditioning treatment prior to conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in paediatric patients.
Busilvex is administered as a two-hour infusion every 6 hours over 4 consecutive days for a total of 16 doses prior to cyclophosphamide or melphalan and conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT)
IBW men (kg)=50 + 0.91x (height in cm-152); IBW women (kg)= 45 + 0.91x (height in cm-152).
In paediatric patients The medicinal product is not recommended in obese children and adolescents with body mass index Weight (kg)/ (m)² &gt; 30 kg/ m² until further data become available.
Studies in renally impaired patients have not been conducted, however, as busulfan is moderately excreted in the urine, dose modification is not recommended in these patients.
Prophylactic or empiric use of anti-infectives (bacterial, fungal, viral) should be considered for the prevention and management of infections during the neutropenic period.
Platelet and red blood cell support, as well as the use of growth factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating agent (G-CSF), should be employed as medically indicated.
In adults, absolute neutrophil counts &lt; 0.5x109/ l at a median of 4 days post transplant occurred in 100% of patients and recovered at median day 10 and 13 days following autologous and allogeneic transplant respectively (median neutropenic period of 6 and 9 days respectively).
Thrombocytopenia (&lt; 25x109/ l or requiring platelet transfusion) occurred at a median of 5-6 days in 98% of patients.
In paediatric patients, absolute neutrophil counts &lt; 0.5x109/ l at a median of 3 days post transplant occurred in 100% of patients and lasted 5 and 18.5 days in autologous and allogeneic transplant respectively.
There is limited clinical experience of the use of busulfan as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in children with Fanconi’ s anaemia.
Since busulfan is mainly metabolized through the liver, caution should be observed when Busilvex is used in patients with pre-existing impairment of liver function, especially in those with severe hepatic impairment.
It is recommended when treating these patients that serum transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin should be monitored regularly 28 days following transplant for early detection of hepatotoxicity.
Patients who have received prior radiation therapy, greater than or equal to three cycles of chemotherapy, or prior progenitor cell transplant may be at an increased risk (see section 4.8).
Caution should be exercised when using paracetamol prior to (less than 72 hours) or concurrently with Busilvex due to a possible decrease in the metabolism of busulfan (See section 4.5).
4 Occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent respiratory failure associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis was reported in Busilvex studies in one patient who died, although, no clear aetiology was identified.
Therefore, men treated with Busilvex are advised not to father a child during and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Busilvex.
Patients should be monitored for signs of busulfan toxicity when itraconazole is used as an antifungal prophylaxis with intravenous busulfan.
In adults, for the BuCy2 regimen it has been reported that the time interval between the last oral busulfan administration and the first cyclophosphamide administration may influence the development of toxicities.
A reduced incidence of Hepatic Veino Occlusive Disease (HVOD) and other regimen- related toxicity have been observed in patients when the lag time between the last dose of oral busulfan and the first dose of cyclophosphamide is &gt; 24hours.
In paediatric patients, for the BuMel regimen it has been reported that the administration of melphalan less than 24 hours after the last oral busulfan administration may influence the development of toxicities.
Paracetamol is described to decrease glutathione levels in blood and tissues, and may therefore decrease busulfan clearance when used in combination (see section 4.4).
5 Phenytoin or benzodiazepines were administered for seizure prophylaxis in all patients in the clinical trials conducted with intravenous busulfan.
The concomitant systemic administration of phenytoin to patients receiving high-dose busulfan has been reported to increase busulfan clearance, due to induction of glutathion-S-transferase.
No interaction was observed when busulfan was combined with fluconazole (antifungal agent) or 5 HT3 antiemetics such as ondansetron or granisetron.
A few cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported with low-dose oral busulfan, not necessarily attributable to the active substance, and third trimester exposure may be associated with impaired intrauterine growth.
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for busulfan in human and animal studies, breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start of therapy.
Therefore it is advised not to father child during the treament and up to 6 months after treatment and to seek advice on cryo-conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility (see section 4.4).
These include infection and Graft-versus host disease (GVHD) which although not directly related, were the major causes of morbidity and mortality, especially in allogeneic HPCT.
6 The incidence of acute graft versus host disease (a-GVHD) data was collected in OMC-BUS-4 study(allogeneic)(n=61).
Chronic GVHD (c-GVHD) was reported if serious or the cause of death, and was reported as the cause of death in 3 patients.
The incidence of a-GVHD grades I-II was 46.4% (13/ 28), while the incidence of grade III-IV was 3.6% (1/ 28).
Veino occlusive disease (VOD) was reported in 15% (4/ 27) and 7% (2/ 28) of the autologous and allogenic transplant respectively.
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100, &lt; 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, &lt; 1/ 100).
The principal toxic effect is profound myeloablation and pancytopenia but the central nervous system, liver, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract may also be affected.
In aqueous media, release of the methanesulphonate groups produces carbonium ions which can alkylate DNA, thought to be an important biological mechanism for its cytotoxic effect.
Clinical trials in adults Documentation of the safety and efficacy of Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide in the BuCy2 regimen prior to conventional allogeneic and/ or autologous HPCT derive from two clinical trials (OMC-BUS-4 and OMC-BUS-3).
Two prospective, single arm, open-label, uncontrolled phase II studies were conducted in patients with haematological disease, the majority of whom had advanced disease.
Patients received doses of 0.8 mg/ kg busulfan every 6 hours infusion for a total 16 doses followed by cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/ kg once per day for two days (BuCy2 regimen).
The time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) greater than 0.5x109 / l was 13 days (range 9-29 days) in allogenic patients (OMC-BUS 4), and 10 days (range 8-19 days) in autologous patients (OMC-BUS 3).
Overall mortality and non- relapse mortality at more than 100 days post-transplant was (8/ 61) 13% and (6/ 61) 10% in allotransplanted patients, respectively.
The time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) greater than 0.5x109/ l was 21 days (range 12-47 days) in allogenic patients, and 11 days (range 10-15 days) in autologous patients.
Pharmacokinetics in adults Absorption The pharmacokinetics of intravenous busulfan was studied in 124 evaluable patients following a 2- hour intravenous infusion for a total of 16 doses over four days.
Similar blood exposure was observed when comparing plasma concentrations in adult patients receiving oral and intravenous busulfan at 1 mg/ kg and 0.8 mg/ kg respectively.
Low inter (CV=21%) and intra (CV=12%) patient variability on busulfan exposure was demonstrated through a population pharmacokinetic analysis, performed on 102 patients.
Pharmacokinetic linearity The dose proportional increase of busulfan exposure was demonstrated following intravenous busulfan up to 1 mg/ kg.
Pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships The literature on busulfan suggests a therapeutic window between 900 and 1500 µMol. minute for AUC.
During clinical trials with intravenous busulfan, 90% of patients AUCs were below the upper AUC limit (1500 µMol. minute) and at least 80% were within the targeted therapeutic window (900- 1500 µMol. minute).
Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients A continuous variation of clearance ranging from 2.49 to 3.92 ml/ minute/ kg has been established in children from &lt; 6 months up to 17 years old.
The dosing recommended in section 4.2. allows to achieve a similar AUC whatever the children's age, the targeted range of AUCs being the one used for adults.
PK/ PD relationship was observed between stomatitis and AUCs in autologous patients and between bilirubin increase and AUCs in a combined autologous and allogeneic patient analysis.
The malformations included serious heart and/ or major vessels anomalies: a common truncus arteriosis and no ductus arteriosis, coarctation of the pulmonary trunk and the pulmonary arteries, intraventricular defects of the heart.
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than the above mentioned conditions when dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

Instructions for use Prior to and following each infusion, flush the indwelling catheter line with approximately 5 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection.
Do not use Busilvex: − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to busulfan or any of the other ingredients of Busilvex − if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant.
You should tell your doctor if: − you have a liver, kidney, heart or lung problem − you have a history of seizures, − you are currently taking other medicines.
Particular caution should be taken if you use itraconazol (used for certain types of infections) or ketobemidone (used to treat pain), because this may increase the side-effects.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are breast-feeding, before you receive treatment with Busilvex.
The recommended dose of Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide or melphalan is based on your body weight varying between 0.8 and 1.2 mg/kg.
Before receiving Busilvex, you will be medicated with − anticonvulsive medicines to prevent seizures (phenytoin or benzodiazepines) and − antiemetic medicines to prevent vomiting.
The most serious side effects of Busilvex therapy or the transplant procedure may include decrease in circulating blood cell counts (intended effect of the medicine to prepare you for your transplant infusion), infection, liver disorders including blocking of a liver vein, graft versus host disease (the graft attacks your body) and pulmonary complications.

What Busilvex looks like and contents of the pack Busilvex consists of a concentrate for solution for infusion and is supplied in colourless glass vials, each vial containing 60 mg of busulfan.
Calculation of the quantity of Busilvex to be diluted and of the diluent Busilvex must be diluted prior to use with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose solution for injection 5%.
The quantity of the diluent must be 10 times the volume of Busilvex ensuring the final concentration of busulfan remains at approximately 0.5 mg/ml.
Preparation of the solution for infusion Busilvex must be prepared by a healthcare professional using sterile transfer techniques. • Using a non polycarbonate syringe fitted with a needle:
Busilvex is used in adults and children as a ‘ conditioning’ (preparative) treatment before transplantation of haematopoietic progenitor cells (the cells that make blood cells).
This type of transplant is used in patients who need to replace their blood-making cells, because they have a blood disorder (such as a rare type of anaemia) or a cancer of the blood.
Because of the number of patients in the European Union (EU) that undergo this type of conditioning and transplant is low, busulfan was designated as an ‘ orphan medicine’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 29 December 2000.
In children up to 17 years of age, the recommended dose of Busilvex is based on the weight of the child and varies between 0.8 and 1.2 mg/ kg.
Each infusion lasts for two hours and it is given to the patient every six hours on four consecutive days before treatment with cyclophosphamide or melphalan and the transplant.
This means that they kill cells, especially cells that develop rapidly, such as cancer or progenitor (or ‘ stem ’) cells (cells that make other types of cell).
Cyclophosphamide or melphalan is then used to suppress the 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
The main measures of effectiveness were the number of patients with myeloablation (with reduced counts of white blood cells and platelets) and ‘ engraftment’ (the time for the white blood cells to return to higher levels).
On average, engraftment was reached in 10 days in adults and 11 days in children with ‘ autotransplantation’ (when the patient receives their own cells, harvested and stored before the transplant).
Engraftment was obtained in 13 days in adults and 21 days in children with ‘ allotransplantation’ (when the patient receives cells from a donor).
Apart from the decrease in blood cell counts, which this is the intended effect of the medicine, the most serious side effects of Busilvex are infection, liver disorders including blocking of a liver vein, graft versus host disease (when the transplanted cells attack the body) and respiratory (lung) disorders.
Because of this, female patients should not become pregnant during treatment and for up to six months afterwards, and male patients are advised not to father a child during and for up to six months after treatment with Busilvex.
Caution is needed when Busilvex is used at the same time as other medicines, such as itraconazole (used to treat some infections), ketobemidone (used to treat pain) and paracetamol.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the effectiveness of Busilvex had been shown, and that it provides an alternative to busulfan tablets, which have disadvantages such as the large number of tablets that need to be taken.
Cervical dystonia, which is also known as torticollis, is a disorder when the neck muscles contract, causing abnormal movement and twisting of the neck and unusual positioning of the head.
NeuroBloc should only be given by injection into a muscle by a specialist who has experience in the treatment of cervical dystonia and in the use of botulinum toxins.
The starting dose of NeuroBloc is 10,000 U, divided into equal injections directly into the two to four muscles in the neck and shoulders that are most affected.
When NeuroBloc is injected directly into a muscle it reduces or prevents muscle contraction at the site of injection, which helps to relieve the symptoms of cervical dystonia.
Three of the studies included patients who had stopped responding to type A botulinum toxin (another type of botulinum toxin that may also be used to treat cervical dystonia), and the fourth only included patients who did respond to type A toxin.
Effectiveness was measured by looking at the change in symptoms (severity, pain and disability) after four weeks, measured using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS).
NeuroBloc should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to botulinum toxin or any of the other ingredients.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that NeuroBloc’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of cervical dystonia (torticollis).
NeuroBloc should only be administered by intramuscular injection by a medical specialist with experience in the treatment of cervical dystonia and in the use of botulinum toxins.
The dosage units are specific to NeuroBloc and are not interchangeable with those used to quantify the dose of other botulinum toxin products.
Data from clinical trials suggest that efficacy is dose dependent but these trials, because they were not powered for a comparison, do not show a significant difference between 5000 U and 10,000 U.
In the patients who responded to treatment (those who experienced an improvement in TWSTRS greater than 20% over baseline) the following duration of effect was observed: at least 4 weeks (40% of patients); at least 8 weeks (30%), at least 12 weeks (16%); 16 weeks or longer (14%).
ALS or peripheral neuropathy) or known neuromuscular junctional disorders (e. g. myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should not be given NeuroBloc.
Following repeated administration of NeuroBloc, development of an immune response can occur due to production of neutralising antibodies to Botulinum Toxin Type B.
There have been spontaneous reports of dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia and/ or potentially fatal respiratory disease, after treatment with botulinum toxin type A/ B.
In patients with neuromuscular disorders or history of dysphagia and aspiration, botulinum toxins should be used under close medical supervision and only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.
Following NeuroBloc treatment, all patients and caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention for respiratory difficulties, choking or any new or worsening dysphagia.
The unit dose recommendations for Botulinum Toxin Type A are significantly lower than those for NeuroBloc and administration of Botulinum Toxin Type A at the unit dose recommended for NeuroBloc may result in systemic toxicity and life-threatening clinical sequelae.
Co-administration of NeuroBloc and aminoglycosides or agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e. g. curare-like compounds) should be considered with caution.
A decision on whether to continue/ discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/ discontinue therapy with NeuroBloc should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NeuroBloc therapy to the women.
The two most commonly reported undesirable effects in clinical studies among patients with prior Botulinum Toxin Type A exposure were dry mouth and dysphagia, which were reported at a frequency of 41% and 29%, respectively.
Data from clinical studies indicate that there is a tendency for the proportion of treatments associated with dysphagia to increase with higher doses injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
The two most commonly reported undesirable effects in a Phase IV comparative clinical study among toxin naïve patients treated with NeuroBloc 10,000 U to 15,000 U were dry mouth and dysphagia, which were reported at a frequency of 44% and 35%, respectively.
In common with Botulinum Toxin Type A, electrophysiological jitter, which is not associated with clinical weakness or other electrophysiological abnormalities, may be experienced in some distant muscles.
Post marketing experience Side effects related to spread of toxin distant from the site of administration have been reported (exaggerated muscle weakness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, aspiration pneumonia with fatal outcome in some cases) (see section 4.4).
The following effects have also been reported during post marketing use: abnormal accommodation, ptosis, vomiting, constipation, flu-like symptoms, and asthenia.
In the event of an overdose or injection into a muscle that normally compensates for the cervical dystonia, it is conceivable that the dystonia may worsen.
The mechanism by which muscle paralysis is reversed over time remains unknown, but may be associated with the intraneuronal turnover of the affected protein and/ or sprouting of the nerve ending.
On enrolment all patients had Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) -Total scores of 20 or greater with at least two muscles involved, no neck contractures or other causes of decreased neck range of motion, and no history of any other neuromuscular disorder.
Study drug was injected on a single occasion into 2 to 4 of the following muscles: splenius capitus, sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, trapezius, semispinalis capitus and scalene.
The secondary endpoints included Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) to quantify the Patient Global Assessment of change and the Physician Global Assessment of change, both from baseline to Week 4.
Exploratory analyses of these studies suggested that the majority of patients who showed a beneficial response by the fourth week had returned to their baseline status between 12 to 16 weeks after their injection.
In the patients who responded to treatment (those who experienced an improvement in TWSTRS greater than 20% over baseline) the following duration of effect was observed at doses of 5000 and 10,000 U.
A Phase IV randomised, multicentre, double-blind study was conducted to compare the efficacy of NeuroBloc (10,000 U) to Botulinum Toxin Type A (150 U) in patients with cervical dystonia who have never previously received a botulinum toxin product.
Final analysis was carried out on a total of 93 enrolled botulinum naive patients (46 in the NeuroBloc group) following a single injection, into 2 of 4 predetermined muscles.
The primary efficacy analysis demonstrates the noninferiority of NeuroBloc to Type A toxin as shown by the TWSTRS total score at session 1, week 4, for the PP population.
Excluding site 121, the mean scores for NeuroBloc and Type A toxin were 32.7 (SD 11.61) and 36.0 (SD 11.71) respectively with a 95% CI of 29.3, 36.2 and 32.6, 39.4 respectively.
7 The robustness of this analysis was confirmed by additional analyses that calculated the 1-sided 97.5% CI, analyses using the unadjusted scores, and analyses using the ITT and interim CSR PP populations.
