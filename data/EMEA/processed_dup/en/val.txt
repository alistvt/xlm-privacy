The most common side effects with Vidaza (seen in more than 60% of patients) are blood reactions including thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) and leucopenia (low white blood cell counts), side effects affecting the stomach and gut including nausea and vomiting, and injection site reactions.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Vidaza’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, CMML with 10-29% abnormal blasts without myeloproliferative disorder or AML with 20-30% blasts and multilineage dysplasia.
Vidaza is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with: • intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), • chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, • acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) classification.
2 Recovery is defined as an increase of cell line(s) where haematological toxicity was observed of at least half of the difference of nadir and the baseline count plus the nadir count (i. e. blood count at recovery ≥ Nadir Count + (0.5 x [Baseline count – Nadir count]).
White Blood Cells (WBC) > 3.0 x 109/ l and ANC > 1.5 x 109/ l, and platelets > 75.0 x 109/ l) prior to the first treatment If haematological toxicity is observed following Vidaza treatment, the next cycle of Vidaza therapy should be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered.
WBC < 3.0 x 109/ l or ANC < 1.5 x 109/ l or platelets < 75.0 x 109/ l) prior to the first treatment Following Vidaza treatment, if the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets from that prior to treatment is less than 50%, or greater than 50% but with an improvement in any cell line differentiation, the next cycle should not be delayed and no dose adjustment made.
No specific modification to the starting dose is recommended in patients with renal impairment (e. g. baseline serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen [BUN] ≥ 2-fold above upper limit of normal [ULN] or serum bicarbonate less than 20 mmol/ l) prior to starting treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology and renal laboratory values.
In addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to < 20 mmol/ l in association with an alkaline urine and hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3 mmol/ l) developed in 5 subjects with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) treated with azacitidine and etoposide.
Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and glutathione transferases (GSTs); interactions related to these metabolizing enzymes in vivo are therefore considered unlikely.
5 The most commonly reported adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were haematological reactions (71.4%) including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia (usually Grade 3-4), gastrointestinal events (60.6%) including nausea, vomiting (usually Grade 1-2) or injection site reactions (77.1%; usually Grade 1-2).
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy and safety of Vidaza were studied in an international, multicenter, controlled, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, Phase 3 comparative study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) in patients with: intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and modified chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (mCMML) according to the French American British (FAB) classification system.
In the ITT analysis of 358 patients (179 azacitidine and 179 CCR), Vidaza treatment was associated with a median survival of 24.46 months versus 15.02 months for those receiving CCR treatment, a difference of 9.4 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0001.
Of the patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 45.0% of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4% of the patients in the combined CCR groups (a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) difference of 33.6% (95% CI:
Metabolism Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and glutathione transferases (GSTs).
In vitro studies of azacitidine with cultured human hepatocytes indicate that at concentrations of 1.0 µM to 100 µM (i. e. up to approximately 30-fold higher than clinically achievable concentrations), azacitidine does not induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4 or 3A5.
In a study to assess inhibition of a series of P450 isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) incubated with 100 µM azacitidine, IC50 values could not be determined, therefore, enzyme inhibition by azacitidine at clinically achievable plasma concentrations is unlikely.

Renal impairment In clinical studies Enviage has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol/ l or 1.70 mg/ dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol/ l or 2.00 mg/ dl in men and/ or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/ min), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension.
The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials.
The adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
6 Hypertension In hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Enviage at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg provided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose.
In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the addition of Enviage 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren 150 mg/ amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%).
In a 6-month study of 599 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nephropathy, all of whom were receiving losartan 100 mg and optimised antihypertensive background therapy, addition of Enviage 300 mg achieved a 20% reduction versus placebo in urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR), i. e. from 58 mg/ mmol to 46 mg/ mmol.
Although aliskiren has known irritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy volunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold based on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/ kg/ day in the rat carcinogenicity study.
Renal impairment In clinical studies Enviage has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol/ l or 1.70 mg/ dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol/ l or 2.00 mg/ dl in men and/ or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/ min), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension.

13 Potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics Based on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other substances that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium.
The adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities. • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. • At the request of the EMEA.
Additionally dosage adjustment of zidovudine may be required if severe anaemia or myelosuppression occurs during treatment with Combivir, or in patients with pre-existing bone marrow compromise e. g. haemoglobin < 9 g/ dl (5.59 mmol/ l) or neutrophil count < 1.0 x 109/ l (see section 4.2).
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive medicinal products (e. g. systemic pentamidine, dapsone, pyrimethamine, co-trimoxazole, amphotericin, flucytosine, ganciclovir, interferon, vincristine, vinblastine and doxorubicin) may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine.
Limited data from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine with co- trimoxazole (see interaction information above relating to lamivudine and co-trimoxazole), aerosolised pentamidine, pyrimethamine and acyclovir at doses used in prophylaxis.
Two patterns of multi-drug resistance mutations, the first characterised by mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase at codons 62, 75, 77, 116 and 151 and the second involving a T69S mutation plus a 6-base pair insert at the same position, result in phenotypic resistance to AZT as well as to the other approved NRTIs.
Subjects receiving lamivudine and zidovudine with or without additional concomitant antiretroviral therapies and who already present with the M184V mutant virus also experience a delay in the onset of mutations that confer resistance to zidovudine and stavudine (Thymidine Analogue Mutations; TAMs).
Following single dose Combivir administration in healthy volunteers, mean (CV) lamivudine and zidovudine Cmax values were 1.6 µg/ ml (32%) and 2.0 µg/ ml (40%), respectively and the corresponding values for AUC were 6.1 µg h/ ml (20%) and 2.4 µg h/ ml (29%) respectively.

INTEGRILIN is used to prevent a myocardial infarction (heart attack) in adult patients who have unstable angina (chest pains due to narrowed arteries to heart) or already have had a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (a type of heart attack), when the symptoms have been seen in the last 24 hours and they have abnormalities on their ECG or biological changes detected in the blood.

INTEGRILIN should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to eptifibatide or any of the other ingredients, in patients who have bleeding problems or have a disease which may cause bleeding (such as stroke, severe high blood pressure), or in patients with severe liver or kidney problems.
Patients most likely to benefit from INTEGRILIN treatment are those at high risk of developing myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina symptoms including for instance those that are likely to undergo an early PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) (see section 5.1).
Adults (≥ 18 years of age) presenting with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction The recommended dosage is an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram/ kg administered as soon as possible following diagnosis, followed by a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min for up to 72 hours, until initiation of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or until discharge from the hospital (whichever occurs first).
INTEGRILIN must not be used to treat patients with: − hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients − evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, gross genitourinary bleeding or other active abnormal bleeding within the previous 30 days of treatment − history of stroke within 30 days or any history of haemorrhagic stroke − known history of intracranial disease (neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm) − major surgery or severe trauma within past 6 weeks − a history of bleeding diathesis − thrombocytopaenia (< 100,000 cells/mm3) − prothrombin time > 1.2 times control, or International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≥ 2.0 − severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 110 mm Hg on antihypertensive therapy) − severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or dependency on renal dialysis; − clinically significant hepatic impairment − concomitant or planned administration of another parenteral GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor
Because INTEGRILIN inhibits platelet aggregation, caution must be employed when it is used with other medicinal products that affect haemostasis, including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, thrombolytics, oral anticoagulants, dextran solutions (see section 6.2), adenosine, sulfinpyrazone, prostacyclin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or dypyridamole (see section 4.5).
There was no consistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with tissue plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study; however, eptifibatide appeared to increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myocardial infarction study.
In an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients, eptifibatide (in regimens up to a bolus injection of 180 microgram/ kg, followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram/ kg/ min for up to 72 hours) was administered concomitantly with streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes).
Reported Adverse Events in PURSUIT at 30 Days* Very common (> 1/ 10), Common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10), Uncommon (> 1/ 1,000 ,< 1/100), Rare (> 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000, Very rare (< 1/ 10,000)
10 Eptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids, including one cysteine amide and one mercaptopropionyl (desamino cysteinyl) residue, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and belongs to the class of RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate)-mimetics.
Measurements of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation at physiologic calcium concentrations (D-phenylalanyl-L- prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone [PPACK] anticoagulant) in patients presenting with unstable angina and Non Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction showed a concentration-dependent inhibition with an IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) of approximately 550 ng/ ml and an IC80 (80% inhibitory concentration) of approximately 1,100 ng/ ml.
Patients were randomised to either placebo, eptifibatide 180 microgram/ kg bolus followed by a 2.0 microgram/ kg/ min infusion (180/ 2.0), or eptifibatide 180 microgram/ kg bolus followed by a 1.3 microgram/ kg/ min infusion (180/ 1.3).
According to epidemiological findings, a higher incidence of cardiovascular events has been associated with certain indicators, for instance: − age − elevated heart rate or blood pressure − persistent or recurrent ischemic cardiac pain − marked ECG changes (in particular ST-segment abnormalities) − raised cardiac enzymes or markers (e. g.
The primary endpoint analysis [quadruple composite of death, MI, urgent target vessel revascularisation (UTVR) and thrombolytic bail-out (TBO) at 48 hours] showed a 37% relative and 3.9% absolute reduction in the eptifibatide group (6.6% events versus 10.5%, p = 0.0015).

Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/ kg/ day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg/ kg/ day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis).
Physical and chemical compatibility testing indicate that INTEGRILIN may be administered through an intravenous line with atropine sulfate, dobutamine, heparin, lidocaine, meperidine, metoprolol, midazolam, morphine, nitroglycerin, tissue plasminogen activator, or verapamil.
Patients most likely to benefit from INTEGRILIN treatment are those at high risk of developing myocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina symptoms including for instance those that are likely to undergo an early PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) (see section 5.1).

Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/ kg/ day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg/ kg/ day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis).
Physical and chemical compatibility testing indicate that INTEGRILIN may be administered through an intravenous line with atropine sulfate, dobutamine, heparin, lidocaine, meperidine, metoprolol, midazolam, morphine, nitroglycerin, tissue plasminogen activator, or verapamil.
Do not take INTEGRILIN: − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to eptifibatide or any of the other ingredients of INTEGRILIN − if you have recently had bleeding from your stomach, intestines, bladder or other organs, for example if you have seen abnormal blood in your stool or urine (except from menstrual bleeding) in the past 30 days − if you have had a stroke within the past 30 days or any haemorrhagic stroke (also, be sure your doctor knows if you ever had a stroke) − if you have had a brain tumor or a condition that affects the blood vessels around the brain − if you had a major operation or injury during the past 6 weeks − if you have or have had bleeding problems − if you have or have had difficulty with your blood clotting or a low blood platelet count − if you have or have had severe hypertension (high blood pressure) − if you have or have had severe kidney or liver problems − if you have been treated with another medicinal product of the same type as INTEGRILIN.
41 Take special care with INTEGRILIN: − INTEGRILIN is recommended for use only in adult, hospitalized patients in coronary care units. − INTEGRILIN is not intended for use in children or adolescents less than 18 years of age. − Before and during your treatment with INTEGRILIN, samples of your blood will be tested as a safety measure to limit the possibility of unexpected bleeding. − During use of INTEGRILIN, you will be checked carefully for any signs of unusual or unexpected bleeding.
Particularly: − blood thinners (oral anticoagulants) or − medicines that prevent blood clots, including warfarin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, acetylsalicylic acid (except for the dose you may be given as part of INTEGRILIN treatment).
Very rare These may affect less than 1 in 10,000 people − serious bleeding (for example, bleeding inside the abdomen, inside the brain, and into the lungs) − fatal bleeding − severe reduction in the number of platelets (blood cells necessary for blood clotting) − skin rash (such as hives) − sudden, severe allergic reaction.

Similar changes were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3 - 4% and haematocrit 3.6 – 4.1% relative reductions) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1 – 2% and haematocrit 1 – 3.2% relative reductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone.
Hypoglycaemia As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary.
In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator.
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone.
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5)

Glustin is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non insulin-dependent diabetes): • It can be used on its own (monotherapy) in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who cannot use metformin (an antidiabetic medicine). • It can also be used together with one other antidiabetic medicine (dual therapy).
Alternatively, it can be added to a sulphonylurea (another antidiabetic medicine) in patients for whom metformin is not suitable and who are not satisfactorily controlled on the sulphonylurea used on its own at the maximum tolerated dose. • It can be used together with two other antidiabetic medicines, metformin and a sulphonylurea, as triple therapy in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who are not satisfactorily controlled on with these two medicines. • It can be used together with insulin in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled with insulin alone and cannot take metformin.
Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents Compared with placebo, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms (comprising rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, sneezing and nasal itching) and ocular symptoms (comprising itching/ burning, tearing/ watering and redness of the eyes) in all 4 studies.
A study of a single 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in increased Cmax (42%) and AUC(0- ∞) (172%) and a modest (on average 23%) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects.

To avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: • Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector clockwise • Hold Mixtard 30 InnoLet with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (picture 1C). • Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button and the dose selector returns to zero • A drop of insulin must appear at the needle tip.
You will hear clicks as the dose selector returns to zero • After the injection, the needle must remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the full dose has been delivered • Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed to return to zero when you press the push-button • Remove the needle after each injection.

In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
Alopecia, altered bowel habits, dyspepsia, dyspnoea, rhinitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia, gynaecomastia, hyperglycaemia, impotence, increased urinary frequency, leucopenia, malaise, mood changes, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, angioedema and erythema multiforme.
Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
9 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Imprida regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7– 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.

In the studies comparing the effectiveness of the combination in patients who were already taking either amlodipine or valsartan, the blood pressure in patients taking valsartan alone had fallen by 6.6 mmHg after eight weeks, compared with 9.6 and 11.4 mmHg in the patients adding 5 or 10 mg amlodipine, respectively.
The most common side effects with Imprida (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat), influenza (flu), various types of oedema (swelling), fatigue (tiredness), flushing (reddening), asthenia (weakness) and hot flushes.
Atripla contains three active substances: efavirenz, which is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI); emtricitabine, which is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; and tenofovir disoproxil, which is a ‘ prodrug ’ of tenofovir, meaning that it is converted into the active substance 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
All three active substances are already available in the European Union (EU): efavirenz has been approved as Sustiva and Stocrin since 1999, emtricitabine has been approved as Emtriva since 2003, and tenofovir disoproxil has been approved as Viread since 2002.
It must not be used in patients with severe liver disease or who are taking any of the following medicines: • terfenadine, astemizole (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may be available without prescription); • cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); • midazolam, triazolam (used to relieve anxiety or difficulty sleeping); • pimozide (used to treat mental illnesses); • bepridil (used to treat angina); • ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine (used to treat migraine headache); • St John’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression); • voriconazole (used to treat fungal infections).
Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring significant resistance to any of the three components contained in Atripla prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
3 ergonovine, and methylergonovine), because competition for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening undesirable effects (for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression) (see section 4.5).
Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risk of continued therapy outweighs the benefits (see section 4.8).
If concomitant use of Atripla and nephrotoxic agents (e. g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir, interleukin-2) is unavoidable, renal function must be monitored weekly (see section 4.5).
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/ dl (0.48 mmol/ l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/ min in any patient receiving Atripla, renal function must be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/ or long term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Bone: in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve patients, small decreases in bone mineral density of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups.
Contraindications of concomitant use Atripla must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3).
Renally eliminated medicinal products: since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of Atripla with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e. g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/ or the co-administered medicinal products.
Other interactions Interactions between the components of Atripla and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “ b. i. d.”, once daily as “ q. d.” and once every 8 hours as “ q8h”).
AUC: ~↓ 40% Cmax: ~↓ 40% Cmin: ~↓ 40% (CYP3A4 induction, the effect of efavirenz is compensated by the pharmacokinetic booster effect of ritonavir) For co-administration of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir in combination with a protease inhibitor, see section on ritonavir below.
Morning AUC: ↓ 33%* (↓ 26 to ↓ 39) Afternoon AUC: ↓ 37%* (↓ 26 to ↓ 46) Evening AUC: ↓ 46%* (↓ 37 to ↓ 54) Morning Cmax: ↔ * Afternoon Cmax: ↔ * Evening Cmax: ↓ 29%* (↓ 11 to ↓ 43) Morning Cmin: ↓ 39%* (↓ 24 to ↓ 51) Afternoon Cmin: ↓ 52%* (↓ 47 to ↓ 57) Evening Cmin: ↓ 57%* (↓ 50 to ↓ 63) * when compared to indinavir 800 q8h alone (CYP3A4 induction) For co-administration of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir in combination with a protease inhibitor, see section on ritonavir below.
When used in combination with efavirenz and two NRTIs, 533/ 133 mg lopinavir/ ritonavir (soft capsules) twice daily yielded similar lopinavir plasma concentrations as compared to lopinavir/ ritonavir (soft capsules) 400/ 100 mg twice daily without efavirenz (historical data).
Morning AUC: ↑ 18% (↑ 6 to ↑ 33) Evening AUC: ↔ Morning Cmax: ↑ 24% (↑ 12 to ↑ 38) Evening Cmax: ↔ Morning Cmin: ↑ 42% (↑ 9 to ↑ 86) Evening Cmin: ↑ 24% (↑ 3 to ↑ 50) Efavirenz:
AUC: ↑ 21% (↑ 10 to ↑ 34) Cmax: ↑ 14% (↑ 4 to ↑ 26) Cmin: ↑ 25% (↑ 7 to ↑ 46) (inhibition of CYP-mediated oxidative metabolism) When efavirenz was given with ritonavir 500 mg or 600 mg twice daily, the combination was not well tolerated (for example, dizziness, nausea, paraesthesia and elevated liver enzymes occurred).
AUC: ↓ 60% (↓ 54 to ↓ 74) Cmax: ↓ 70% (↓ 58 to ↓ 85) (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values.
AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
Studies conducted with other medicinal products: there were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when efavirenz was administered with azithromycin, cetirizine, lorazepam, nelfinavir, zidovudine, aluminium/ magnesium hydroxide antacids, famotidine or fluconazole.
Assessment of adverse reactions for the fixed combination Atripla is based on experience from: • a 48-week clinical study of Atripla (see Table 2) • a clinical study in which efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were co- administered (see Table 3) • clinical study and post-marketing experience with the individual components of Atripla (see Table 4).
Adverse reactions from clinical study experience with Atripla In a 48-week open-label randomised clinical study in HIV infected patients with successful virological suppression on their current antiretroviral regimen, patients either changed to Atripla (n=203) or continued on their original antiretroviral treatment regimen (n=97).
Adverse reactions from clinical study experience with efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate The following data are derived from a clinical study (GS-01-934) in which efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were co-administered without regard to food as individual formulations or as a dual fixed combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with efavirenz.
Liver enzymes: in a 144-week clinical study (GS-01-934), elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST > 5 times ULN (upper limit of normal)) and of alanine aminotransferase (ALT > 5 times ULN) were reported in 3% and 2% of patients treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n=257) and 3% and 3% of patients treated with efavirenz and fixed-dose zidovudine/ lamivudine (n=254), respectively.
The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures), hypokalaemia, muscular weakness, myopathy and hypophosphataemia.
Psychiatric symptoms with efavirenz: patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of serious psychiatric adverse reactions listed in the efavirenz column of Table 4 with the frequency of events ranging from 0.3% for manic reactions to 2.0% for both severe depression and suicidal ideation.
Analysis of long-term data from a clinical study (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.
Lipids, lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin-resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump) (see section 4.4).
However, in a 144-week open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) in antiretroviral-naïve patients, where efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were used as individual formulations (or as efavirenz and the fixed combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) from week 96 to 144), genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all patients with confirmed HIV RNA > 400 copies/ ml at week 144 or early study drug discontinuation (see section on Clinical experience).
• The M184V/ I mutation developed in 2/ 19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group and in 10/ 29 (34.5%) isolates analysed from the efavirenz + lamivudine/ zidovudine group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher’ s Exact test comparing the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group to the lamivudine/ zidovudine group among all subjects). • No virus analysed contained the K65R mutation. • Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from 13/ 19 (68%) patients in the efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group and in virus from 21/ 29 (72%) patients in the efavirenz + lamivudine/ zidovudine group.
In a 144-week open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients received either a once-daily regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or a fixed combination of lamivudine and zidovudine (Combivir) administered twice daily and efavirenz once daily (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Truvada).
Study AI266073 was a 48-week open-label randomised clinical study in HIV infected patients comparing the efficacy of Atripla to antiretroviral therapy consisting of at least two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; however not a regimen containing all Atripla components (efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).
When the two strata were analysed separately, response rates in the stratum with prior PI-treatment were numerically lower for patients switched to Atripla [92.4% versus 94.0% for the PVR (sensitivity analysis) for Atripla and SBR patients respectively; a difference (95%CI) of -1.6% (-10.0%, 6.7%)].
Patients coinfected with HIV and HBV: limited clinical experience in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV suggests that treatment with emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection also results in a reduction in HBV DNA (3 log10 reduction or 4 to 5 log10 reduction, respectively) (see section 4.4).
The bioequivalence of one Atripla film-coated tablet with one efavirenz 600 mg film-coated tablet plus one emtricitabine 200 mg hard capsule plus one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablet (equivalent to 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) administered together, was established following single dose administration to fasting healthy subjects in study GS-US-177-0105 (see Table 7).
In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, steady-state peak concentration (Cmax) was 12.9 ± 3.7 µM (29%) [mean ± standard deviation (S. D.) (coefficient of variation (%CV))], steady-state Cmin was 5.6 ± 3.2 µM (57%), and AUC was 184 ± 73 µM• h (40%).
Following multiple dose oral administration of emtricitabine to 20 HIV infected patients, steady-state Cmax was 1.8 ± 0.7 µg/ ml (mean ± S. D.) (39%CV), steady-state Cmin was 0.09 ± 0.07 µg/ ml (80%) and the AUC was 10.0 ± 3.1 µg• h/ ml (31%) over a 24 hour dosing interval.
Following oral administration of a single 300 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to HIV-1 infected patients in the fasted state, maximum tenofovir concentrations were achieved within one hour and the Cmax and AUC (mean ± S. D.) (%CV) values were 296 ± 90 ng/ ml (30%) and 2,287 ± 685 ng• h/ ml (30%), respectively.
Compared to fasted administration, dosing of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine in combination with either a high fat meal or a light meal increased the mean AUC and Cmax of tenofovir by 35% and 15%, respectively without affecting emtricitabine exposures.
The degree of renal impairment was defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (normal renal function when creatinine clearance > 80 ml/ min; mild impairment with creatinine clearance=50 to 79 ml/ min; moderate impairment with creatinine clearance=30 to 49 ml/ min and severe impairment with creatinine clearance=10 to 29 ml/ min).
The mean (%CV) emtricitabine exposure increased from 12 µg• h/ ml (25%) in subjects with normal renal function to 20 µg• h/ ml (6%), 25 µg• h/ ml (23%) and 34 µg• h/ ml (6%) in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.
The mean (%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 ng• h/ ml (12%) in patients with normal renal function, to 3,064 ng• h/ ml (30%), 6,009 ng• h/ ml (42%) and 15,985 ng• h/ ml (45%) in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.
In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis drug exposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 µg• h/ ml (19%) of emtricitabine, and over 48 hours to 42,857 ng• h/ ml (29%) of tenofovir.
The MAH shall ensure that additional risk minimisation activities to address the renal safety concerns related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, one of the active substances contained in Atripla, are being implemented for this fixed combination like for all medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version 2.0 (28/ 02/ 2008) and included in the Type II variation (EMEA/ H/ C/ 000797/ II/ 0003) is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy, defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1-2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate, or Vitamin B12-deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss, and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose adjustment detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk of thrombotic events (see section 4.2).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoietic agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with Retacrit) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).

If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose adjustment detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk of thrombotic events (see section 4.2).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoietic agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with Retacrit) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown: • shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l), • shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12-14 g/ dl (7.5 -8.7 mmol/ l),
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastrointestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Retacrit must not be used if • The blister sealing is broken or the blister is damaged in any way. • The liquid is coloured or you can see particles floating in it. • Any liquid has leaked out of the pre-filled syringe or condensation is visible within the sealed blister. • It may have been accidentally frozen.
4.1 Therapeutic indications − Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients: o Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in adult and paediatric patients on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4). o Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4). − Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy). − Retacrit can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
If the haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times per week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.

Please tell your doctor if you know you are suffering, or have suffered, from any of the following: − epileptic seizures − liver disease − cancer − anaemia from other causes − heart disease (such as angina) − disorders of blood circulation resulting in pins and needles or cold hands or feet or muscle cramps in the legs − blood clots/blood clotting disorders − phenylketonuria (genetic enzyme deficiency that increases excretion of a chemical (phenylketone) in urine and may cause nervous system disorders) − kidney disease.
Your doctor will check on this. – Vascular and thrombotic events (blood clotting) in blood vessels, such as disturbed blood perfusion of the heart, heart attack, cerebral haemorrhages, stroke, temporary disturbance of blood perfusion in the brain, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, dilatation of the wall of a blood vessel (aneurysm), retinal thrombosis, and blood clot in an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietin treatment. – Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in rare cases, including swelling, mainly in the region of the eyelids and the lips (Quincke's oedema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms of tingling, reddening, itching, hot flush and accelerated pulse. – Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of subcutaneous (injection under the skin) erythropoietin treatment.
191 The other ingredients are disodium phosphate dihydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride dihydrate, polysorbate 20, glycine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, glutamic acid, phenylalanine, water for injections, sodium hydroxide (pH adjuster), hydrochloric acid (pH adjuster).
Retacrit is used to stimulate red blood cell production in the following situations: • to treat anaemia (low red blood cell counts) caused by chronic renal failure (long-term, progressive decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or other kidney problems, • to treat anaemia and reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer, • to increase the amount of blood that patients with moderate anaemia can donate before surgery, so that their own blood can be given back to them during or after surgery.

It should also not be used in the following groups: • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia (reduced or stopped red blood cell production) following treatment with any erythropoietin; • patients with hypertension (high blood pressure) that is not controlled; • patients about to undergo surgery who have severe cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke; • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots.
CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES
The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements: • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) • That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is increased with the subcutaneous route. • There is insufficient data on Silapo/ Retacrit to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with subcutaneous use • Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CRF • Loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
Evista should not be used in women who: • could become pregnant; • have or have had any blood clot disorders, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs); • have liver disease, severe kidney disease, unexplained bleeding from the womb or endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb).
The following convention has been used for the classification of the adverse reactions: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Compared with placebo-treated patients the occurrence of vasodilatation (hot flushes) was modestly increased in EVISTA patients (clinical trials for the prevention of osteoporosis, 2 to 8 years postmenopausal, 24.3% EVISTA and 18.2% placebo; clinical trials for the treatment of osteoporosis, mean age 66, 10.6% for EVISTA and 7.1% placebo).
In a study of 10,101 postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events (RUTH), the occurrence of vasodilatation (hot flushes) was 7.8% in the raloxifene-treated patients and 4.7% in the placebo-treated patients.
In a study of 7,705 postmenopausal women with a mean age of 66 years and with osteoporosis or osteoporosis with an existing fracture, EVISTA treatment for 3 years reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures by 47% (RR 0.53, CI 0.35, 0.79; p < 0.001) and 31% (RR 0.69, CI 0.56, 0.86; p < 0.001) respectively.
Over the 4 years of the osteoporosis treatment trial (involving 7705 patients), EVISTA treatment compared to placebo reduced the risk of total breast cancer by 62% (RR 0.38; CI 0.21, 0.69), the risk of invasive breast cancer by 71% (RR 0.29, CI 0.13, 0.58) and the risk of invasive oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer by 79% (RR 0.21, CI 0.07, 0.50).
At doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/ kg/ day in female rats, raloxifene disrupted estrous cycles of female rats during treatment, but did not delay fertile matings after treatment termination and only marginally reduced litter size, increased gestation length, and altered the timing of events in neonatal development.
• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to raloxifene or any of the ingredients of EVISTA. • If there is still a possibility that you can get pregnant, EVISTA could harm your unborn child. • If you are being treated or have been treated for blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or retinal vein thrombosis). • If you have liver disease (examples of liver disease include cirrhosis, mild hepatic impairment or cholestatic jaundice). • If you have any unexplained vaginal bleeding.
• If you are immobilised for some time such as being wheel-chair bound, needing to be admitted to a hospital or having to stay in bed while recovering from an operation or an unexpected illness. • If you are receiving oral oestrogen therapy. • If you are suffering from breast cancer, as there is insufficient experience of EVISTA use in women with this disease. • If you have had a cerebrovascular accident (e. g. stroke), or if your doctor has told you that you are at high risk of having one.
Uncommon side effects (affects 1 to 10 users in 1000) are: • Increased risk of blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) • Increased risk of blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) • Increased risk of blood clots in the eyes (retinal vein thrombosis) • Skin around the vein is red and painful (superficial vein thrombophlebitis)
Very rare side effects (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) are: • Rash • Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and stomach upset • Increased blood pressure • Decrease in the number of the platelets in the blood • Blood clot in an artery (for example stroke) • Headache including migraine • Mild breast symptoms such as pain, enlargement and tenderness

• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanut or soya or any of the excipients • Urinary retention • Gastric retention • Uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma • Myasthenia gravis • Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) • Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic or renal impairment • Severe ulcerative colitis • Toxic megacolon.
As with other antimuscarinics, fesoterodine should be used with caution in patients with risk for QT- prolongation (e. g. hypokalaemia, bradycardia and concomitant administration of medicines known to prolong QT interval) and relevant pre-existing cardiac diseases (e. g. myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure), (see section 4.8).
Pharmacological interactions Caution should be exercised in coadministration of fesoterodine with other antimuscarinic agents and medicinal products with anticholinergic properties (e. g. amantadine, tri-cyclic antidepressants, certain neuroleptics) as this may lead to more pronounced therapeutic- and side-effects (e. g. constipation, dry mouth, drowsiness, urinary retention).
Pharmacokinetic interactions In vitro data demonstrate that the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations.
Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following inhibition of CYP3A4 by co-administration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily, Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0 and 2.3-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers and 2.1 and 2.5-fold in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, respectively.
Therefore, the maximum dose of fesoterodine should be restricted to 4 mg when used concomitantly with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir (and all ritonavir boosted PI-regimens), saquinivir and telithromycin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4)).
4 Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors No study has been performed evaluating the effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e. g. amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, verapamil) on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine.
The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was thoroughly evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel group study with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 45 to 65 years.
After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N- desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in faeces.
However in conscious dogs, the active metabolite had no effect on the QT interval and QTc interval at plasma exposures at least 33-fold higher than mean peak free plasma concentration in human subjects who are extensive metabolisers and 21-fold higher than measured in subjects who are poor CYP2D6 metabolisers after fesoterodine 8 mg once daily.

It should also not be used in patients: • who have had radiation therapy to the skeleton, • who have any disorder that affects the calcium balance in the body, • who have a bone disease that is not osteoporosis, • with unexplained high levels of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme), • with severe kidney or liver disease
Preotact is contraindicated in patients • with hypersensitivity to parathyroid hormone or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1) • who have previously received radiation therapy to the skeleton • with pre-existing hypercalcemia and other disturbances in the phosphocalcic metabolism • with metabolic bone diseases other than primary osteoporosis (including hyperparathyroidism and Paget’ s disease of the bone) • with unexplained elevations of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase • with severe renal impairment • with severe hepatic impairment
The following categories are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency of occurrence: very common (> 1/10); common (> 1/100 and < 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1000 and < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000 and < 1/1000); and very rare (< 1/10,000), including isolated reports.
A total of 2532 patients (1286 Preotact and 1246 placebo), aged 45-94 years (8.1% 45-54 years and 11.4% > 75 years), were randomised to receive 100 micrograms/day or placebo with daily calcium (700 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplementation.
Treatment of osteoporosis with combination and sequential therapy The PaTH study was a NIH sponsored randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 year, multicenter, double- blind trial of Preotact and alendronate as monotherapy and in combination for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Renal impairment The overall exposure and Cmax of parathyroid hormone were slightly increased (22% and 56%, respectively) in a group of 8 male and 8 female subjects with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearances of 30 to 80 ml/min) compared with a matched group of 16 subjects with normal renal function.
Do not use Preotact: • if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to parathyroid hormone or any of the other ingredients of Preotact; • if you have had radiation therapy to the skeleton; • if you suffer from high calcium levels and other disturbances in the calcium-phosphor metabolism; • if you have other bone disease (including hyperparathyroidism or Paget’s disease); • if you have high levels of alkaline phosphatase; • if you suffer from severe kidney problems; • if you suffer from severe liver disease;
Never remove a cartridge in use from the pen. • DO NOT SHAKE the Preotact pen (neither before nor after injection) as it may destroy the effect of the active substance • Use a new injection needle for each injection and throw it away after each use. • Never store your Preotact pen with the needle attached. • Never share your Preotact pen with anyone.
Do not freeze. • A cartridge in use will keep for 28 days in refrigerator. • If for some reason you cannot store your Preotact pen (with the inserted cartridge) in a refrigerator for a number of days, it can be stored outside the refrigerator below 25°C - BUT ONLY FOR A TOTAL OF 7 DAYS during the 28-day use period. • If the Preotact solution in the cartridge is more than 28 days old, or if it has not been stored correctly, throw it away, even if the cartridge is not completely empty. • If the Preotact solution becomes cloudy or coloured throw the cartridge away.
Therefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Ytracis, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca- EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body.
Haemorrhage Fondaparinux should be used with caution in patients who have an increased risk of haemorrhage, such as those with congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (e. g. platelet count < 50,000/ mm3), active ulcerative gastrointestinal disease and recent intracranial haemorrhage or shortly after brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery and in special patient groups as outlined below.
The safety of fondaparinux 2.5 mg has been evaluated in 3,595 patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs treated up to 9 days, in 327 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery treated for 3 weeks following an initial prophylaxis of 1 week, 1,407 patients undergoing abdominal surgery treated up to 9 days, and in 425 medical patients who are at risk for thromboembolic complications treated up to 14 days.
The adverse reactions reported by the investigator as at least possibly related to fondaparinux are presented within each frequency grouping (very common ≥ 1/ 10; common: ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon: ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100; rare: ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000; very rare < 1/ 10,000) and system organ class by decreasing order of seriousness; these adverse reactions should be interpreted within the surgical and medical context.
6 At the 2.5 mg dose, fondaparinux does not affect routine coagulation tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated clotting time (ACT) or prothrombin time (PT)/ International Normalised Ratio (INR) tests in plasma nor bleeding time or fibrinolytic activity.
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs treated up to 9 days The fondaparinux clinical program was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of fondaparinux for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), i. e. proximal and distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs such as hip fracture, major knee surgery or hip replacement surgery.
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery treated for up to 24 days following an initial prophylaxis of 1 week In a randomised double-blind clinical trial, 737 patients were treated with fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily for 7 +/ - 1 days following hip fracture surgery.
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are judged to be at high risk of thromboembolic complications, such as patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery In a double-blind clinical study, 2,927 patients were randomized to receive fondaparinux 2.5mg once daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU once daily, with one 2,500 IU preoperative injection and a first 2,500 IU post-operative injection, for 7+2 days.
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in medical patients who are at high risk for thromboembolic complications due to restricted mobility during acute illness In a randomised double-blind clinical trial, 839 patients were treated with fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily or placebo for 6 to 14 days.
Renal impairment - Compared with patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/ min), plasma clearance is 1.2 to 1.4 times lower in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/ min) and on average 2 times lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 ml/ min).
Hepatic impairment - Following a single, subcutaneous dose of fondaparinux in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B), total (i. e., bound and unbound) Cmax and AUC were decreased by 22% and 39%, respectively, as compared to subjects with normal liver function.
Haemorrhage Fondaparinux should be used with caution in patients who have an increased risk of haemorrhage, such as those with congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (e. g. platelet count < 50,000/ mm3), active ulcerative gastrointestinal disease and recent intracranial haemorrhage or shortly after brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery and in special patient groups as outlined below.
16 For the prevention of VTE, the adverse reactions reported by the investigator as at least possibly related to fondaparinux are presented within each frequency grouping (very common ≥ 1/ 10; common: ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon: ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100; rare: ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000; very rare < 1/ 10,000) and system organ class by decreasing order of seriousness; these adverse reactions should be interpreted within the surgical and medical context.
18 At the 2.5 mg dose, fondaparinux does not affect routine coagulation tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated clotting time (ACT) or prothrombin time (PT)/ International Normalised Ratio (INR) tests in plasma nor bleeding time or fibrinolytic activity.

Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery treated for up to 24 days following an initial prophylaxis of 1 week In a randomised double-blind clinical trial, 737 patients were treated with fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily for 7 +/ - 1 days following hip fracture surgery.
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are judged to be at high risk of thromboembolic complications, such as patients undergoing abdominal cancer surgery In a double-blind clinical study, 2,927 patients were randomized to receive fondaparinux 2.5mg once daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU once daily, with one 2,500 IU preoperative injection and a first 2,500 IU post-operative injection, for 7+2 days.
Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in medical patients who are at high risk for thromboembolic complications due to restricted mobility during acute illness In a randomised double-blind clinical trial, 839 patients were treated with fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily or placebo for 6 to 14 days.
Treatment of unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/ NSTEMI) OASIS 5 was a double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority study with fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily versus enoxaparin 1 mg/ kg subcutaneously twice daily in approximately 20,000 patients with UA/ NSTEMI.
Treatment of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) OASIS 6 was a double blind, randomised study assessing the safety and efficacy of fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily, versus usual care (placebo (47%) or UFH (53%) in approximately 12,000 patients with STEMI.
In the predefined stratum comparing fondaparinux to placebo (i. e patients treated with non- fibrin specific lytics (77.3%), no reperfusion (22%), fibrin-specific lytics (0.3%), primary PCI (0.4%), the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 was significantly reduced from 14.0% on placebo to 11.3% (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI, 0.69, 0.93, p = 0.003).
In the predefined stratum comparing fondaparinux to UFH (patients treated with primary PCI (58.5%), fibrin-specific lytics (13%), non-fibrin-specific lytics (2.6%) and no reperfusion (25.9%), the effects of fondaparinux and UFH on the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 were not statistically different: respectively, 8.3% vs 8.7% (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI, 0.79, 1.11 p = 0.460).
However, in this stratum, in the subgroup of indicated population undergoing thrombolysis or no reperfusion (i. e patients not undergoing primary PCI), the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 was significantly reduced from 14.3% on UFH to 11.5% with fondaparinux (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI, 0.64, 0.98, p = 0.03).
In patients who were revascularised with a thrombolytic, fondaparinux significantly reduced the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 from 13.6% for the control group to 10.9% (hazard ratio 0.79, 95%CI, 0.68; 0.93, p = 0.003).
Renal impairment - Compared with patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/ min), plasma clearance is 1.2 to 1.4 times lower in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/ min) and on average 2 times lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 ml/ min).
Hepatic impairment - Following a single, subcutaneous dose of fondaparinux in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B), total (i. e., bound and unbound) Cmax and AUC were decreased by 22% and 39%, respectively, as compared to subjects with normal liver function.
Haemorrhage Fondaparinux should be used with caution in patients who have an increased risk of haemorrhage, such as those with congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (e. g. platelet count < 50,000/ mm3), active ulcerative gastrointestinal disease and recent intracranial haemorrhage or shortly after brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery and in special patient groups as outlined below.
26 corresponding incidences in patients receiving the recommended regimen of enoxaparin in the treatment of DVT were 2.5%, 3.6% and 8.3% respectively, while the incidences in patients receiving the recommended regimen of UFH in the treatment of PE were 5.5%, 6.6% and 7.4%, respectively.
Incidences of bleeding events in patients receiving the recommended regimen in the treatment of DVT or PE with normal renal function, mild renal impairment, moderate renal impairment and severe renal impairment were 3.0% (34/ 1,132), 4.4% (32/ 733), 6.6% (21/ 318), and 14.5% (8/ 55) respectively.
The corresponding incidences in patients receiving the recommended regimen of enoxaparin in the treatment of DVT were 2.3% (13/ 559), 4.6% (17/ 368), 9.7% (14/ 145) and 11.1% (2/ 18) respectively, and in patients receiving the recommended regimen of unfractionated heparin in the treatment of PE were 6.9% (36/ 523), 3.1% (11/ 352), 11.1% (18/ 162) and 10.7% (3/ 28), respectively.
In clinical studies performed with fondaparinux, oral anticoagulants (warfarin) did not interact with the pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux; at the 10 mg dose used in the interaction studies, fondaparinux did not influence the anticoagulation monitoring (INR) activity of warfarin.
The adverse reactions reported by the investigator as at least possibly related to fondaparinux are presented within each frequency grouping (very common ≥ 1/ 10; common: ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon: ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100; rare: ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000; very rare < 1/ 10,000) and system organ class by decreasing order of seriousness.
Common: bleeding (gastrointestinal, haematuria, haematoma, epistaxis, haemoptysis, utero-vaginal haemorrhage, haemarthrosis, ocular, purpura, bruise) Uncommon: anaemia, thrombocytopaenia Rare: other bleeding (hepatic, retroperitoneal, intracranial/ intracerebral), thrombocythaemia
At the doses used for treatment, fondaparinux does not, to a clinically relevant extent, affect routine coagulation tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated clotting time (ACT) or prothrombin time (PT)/ International Normalised Ratio (INR) tests in plasma nor bleeding time or fibrinolytic activity.
Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis In a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute symptomatic DVT, fondaparinux 5 mg (body weight< 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight ≥ 50 kg, ≤ 100 kg) or 10 mg (body weight > 100 kg) SC once daily was compared to enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/ kg SC twice daily.
Fondaparinux 5 mg (body weight< 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight ≥ 50kg, ≤ 100 kg) or 10 mg (body weight > 100 kg) SC once daily was compared to unfractionated heparin IV bolus (5,000 IU) followed by a continuous IV infusion adjusted to maintain 1.5– 2.5 times aPTT control value.
Renal impairment - Compared with patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/ min) undergoing orthopaedic surgery and receiving fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily, plasma clearance is 1.2 to 1.4 times lower in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/ min) and on average 2 times lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 ml/ min).
Hepatic impairment - Following a single, subcutaneous dose of fondaparinux in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B), total (i. e., bound and unbound) Cmax and AUC were decreased by 22% and 39%, respectively, as compared to subjects with normal liver function.

The first compared the effects of Arixtra with those of enoxaparin in over 20,000 patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction without ST segment elevation, and the second compared Arixtra with standard care (unfractionated heparin in eligible patients, or placebo) in over 12,000 patients with myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation.
However no evidence of this effect has been seen in intravenous data. (see section 4.4) No interaction has been reported when benzodiazepines such as diazepam, clonazepam or lorazepam have been used to prevent seizures with high-dose busulfan (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Diseases included were acute leukemia past first remission, in first or subsequent relapse, in first remission (high risk), or induction failures; chronic melogenous leukemia in chronic or advanced phase; primary refractory or resistant relapsed Hodgkin’ s disease or non-Hodgkin’ s lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
Clinical trials in paediatric patients Documentation of the safety and efficacy of Busilvex in combination with cyclophosphamide in the BuCy4 or with melphalan in the BuMel regimen prior to conventional allogeneic and/ or autologous HPCT derives from clinical trial F60002 IN 101 G0.
In this case infusion sets with minimal priming space should be used (i.e 0.3-0.6 ml), primed with medicinal product solution prior to beginning the actual Busilvex infusion and then flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose (5%) solution for injection.

The most common side effects with NeuroBloc (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are dry mouth, headache (in patients new to treatment with botulinum toxins), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and reactions at the site of the injection (in patients previously treated with botulinum toxins).
In the first study, type A resistant patients (A-non responders) were randomised to receive placebo or 10,000 U of NeuroBloc and in the second, type A toxin responsive patients (A-responders) were randomised to receive placebo, 5000 U or 10,000 U of toxin.
The upper limit of the 1-sided CI in the LS mean difference (NeuroBloc - type A toxin) in the TWSTRS total score at week 4 of session 1 for the PP population (excluding site 121) was 0.6 which is well within the predefined criterion for noninferiority of 4 points in the mean difference between groups adjusted for baseline for the TWSTRS.
In this regard the noninferiority of NeuroBloc compared to Botulinum Toxin Type A is also supported by a responder analysis using the ITT population, which showed that a similar percentages of subjects showed any improvement in the TWSTRS score at Week 4 of Session 1 (86% NeuroBloc and 85% Botox), as did subjects who experienced at least a 20% decrease from baseline in the TWSTRS score at Week 4 of Session 1 (51% NeuroBloc, 47% Botox).
Following local intramuscular injection of NeuroBloc serious adverse events that may have been due to systemic effects of Botulinum Toxin Type B, were observed in 12% of adverse drug reaction cases reported during the post-marketing experience (including the following adverse events: dry mouth, dysphagia and blurred vision).
Pregnancy and breast feeding Generally, you should not be given NeuroBloc if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, this is because there is not enough information about the use of NeuroBloc in patients who are pregnant and it is not known if breast milk contains NeuroBloc in nursing mothers treated with the medicine.

In the Doppler studies, using SonoVue to measure blood flow in large blood vessels improved the quality of the scan when testing the cerebral arteries (in the head), the carotids (in the neck) and the portal vein (leading to the liver), but not the renal arteries (leading to the kidneys).
The most common side effects with SonoVue (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, nausea (feeling sick), injection site pain, injection site reactions, including bruising, burning, and paraesthesia (unusual sensations like pins and needles) at the injection site.
SonoVue should also not be used in the following patients: • patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (symptoms involving the heart) or unstable ischaemic cardiac disease (reduced blood supply to the heart), • patients known to have right-to-left shunts (abnormal movement of blood within the heart), severe pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that leads from the heart to the lungs), uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (severe fluid build-up in both lungs), • pregnant or breast-feeding women.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that SonoVue’ s benefits are greater than its risks to enhance the echogenicity (ultrasound contrast) of the blood in echocardiography in patients with suspected or established cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac chambers and enhance left ventricular endocardial border delineation, and in Doppler of macrovasculature (cerebral arteries, extracranial carotid or peripheral arteries and portal vein) or microvasculature (liver and breast lesions).
SonoVue is contraindicated for use in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or clinically unstable ischaemic cardiac disease, including: evolving or ongoing myocardial infarction, typical angina at rest within last 7 days, significant worsening of cardiac symptoms within last 7 days, recent coronary artery intervention or other factors suggesting clinical instability (for example, recent deterioration of ECG, laboratory or clinical findings), acute cardiac failure, Class III/ IV cardiac failure, or severe rhythm disorders.
Numbers of patients with the following conditions who were exposed to SonoVue in the clinical trials were limited, and therefore, caution is advisable when administering the product to patients with: acute endocarditis, prosthetic valves, acute systemic inflammation and/ or sepsis, hyperactive coagulation states and/ or recent thromboembolism, and end-stage renal or hepatic disease.

19 Side effects less commonly reported include: itching; rash; abdominal, chest or back pain and pain in general; vasodilatation; increase in blood sugar levels; blurred vision; irritation in the throat; sinus pressure; numbness in part of the body; dizziness; difficulty in sleeping; feeling weak; a strange taste.
In patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: − Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction): clopidogrel treatment should be initiated with a single 300-mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once a day (with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75 mg-325 mg daily).
As with other antiplatelet agents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including Cox-2 inhibitors.
However, patients entered into clinical trials with clopidogrel received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diuretics, beta blockers, ACEI, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents (including insulin), antiepileptic agents, and GPIIb/ IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
In CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel + ASA group (17.4%) vs. the placebo + ASA group (12.9%). The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups (1.3% versus 1.1% for the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, respectively).
The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been evaluated in 4 double-blind studies involving over 80,000 patients: the CAPRIE study, a comparison of clopidogrel to ASA, and the CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies comparing clopidogrel to placebo, both medicinal products given in combination with ASA and other standard therapy.
In a subgroup analysis by qualifying condition (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and PAD) the benefit appeared to be strongest (achieving statistical significance at p = 0.003) in patients enrolled due to PAD (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) (RRR = 23.7%; CI:
8 The number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p=0.00009) for the clopidogrel-treated group (17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, 29% when they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent and 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)).
12.8, 46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, 6-9 and 9-12 month study intervals, respectively.
The number of patients experiencing the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the placebo- treated group, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6%-21%, p=0.0005) for the clopidogrel- treated group.
In particular, in a post-hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the total CURE population) who underwent stent placement (Stent-CURE), the data showed that clopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia).
Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg/ day, n=1,752) or placebo (n=1,739), both in combination with ASA (150 to 325 mg as a loading dose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/ day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, heparin.
After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day, plasma levels of the main circulating metabolite were lower in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 ml/ min) compared to subjects with moderate renal disease (creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 ml/ min) and to levels observed in other studies with healthy subjects.

In ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Iscover was compared with a placebo in two studies, CLARITY (over 3,000 patients, where the patients received Iscover for up to eight days) and COMMIT (almost 46,000 patients, where the patients received Iscover with or without metoprolol for up to four weeks).
Valtropin is used to treat children in the following situations: • children who fail to grow because they lack growth hormone (replacement therapy). • children who are short because of Turner syndrome (a rare genetic disorder affecting girls), confirmed by chromosome analysis (DNA testing). • children before puberty, who fail to grow because of longstanding kidney disease (chronic renal insufficiency).
The most common side effects (seen in between 1 patient and 10 patients per 100) are: in children, mild oedema (accumulation of fluid); transient local skin reactions, low thyroid hormone levels; in adults, headache, oedema, numbness, tingling, joint pain and disorders and muscle pain.
In patients with childhood-onset isolated growth hormone deficiency (no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease or cranial irradiation), two dynamic tests should be recommended, except for those having low insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations (< 2 standard deviation score (SDS)), who may be considered for one test.
Nerve effects • Symptoms of benign increased brain pressure (benign intracranial hypertension): rare • Headache: very common (adults) • Insomnia: very rare (children); common (adults) • Abnormal sensation (paraesthesia): rare (children); very common (adults)
Tarceva has not been shown to be effective in patients whose tumours are ‘ EGFR-negative’. ‘ EGFR-negative’ means that some receptors, the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), cannot be detected on the surface of the cancer cells, or can only be detected in small quantities. • metastatic pancreatic cancer, in combination with gemcitabine (another anticancer medicine).

When looking at the results in patients who received Tarceva, and according to their tumour type, the survival figures were 8.6 months in patients who were ‘ EGFR-positive’ (those who had tumour cells that were shown to carry EGFR), compared with 5.0 months in patients who were EGFR-negative.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Tarceva had shown that it is effective in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, although there was not enough justification for, or data on its use in patients whose tumours are EGFR-negative.
Reported diagnoses in patients suspected of having ILD-like events included pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), alveolitis, and lung infiltration.
In more severe or persistent cases of diarrhoea, or cases leading to dehydration, particularly in groups of patients with aggravating risk factors (concomitant medications, symptoms or diseases or other predisposing conditions including advanced age), Tarceva therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to intensively rehydrate the patients intravenously.
For patients who require concomitant treatment with Tarceva and a potent CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampicin an increase in dose to 300 mg should be considered while their safety (including renal and liver functions and serum electrolytes) is closely monitored, and if well tolerated for more than 2 weeks, further increase to 450 mg could be considered with close safety monitoring.
6 Adverse events occurring more frequently (≥ 3%) in Tarceva-treated patients than in the placebo group in the pivotal study BR.21, and in at least 10% of patients in the Tarceva group, are summarised by National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) Grade in Table 1.
7 Adverse events occurring more frequently (≥ 3%) in Tarceva 100 mg plus gemcitabine-treated patients than in the placebo plus gemcitabine group in the pivotal study PA.3, and in at least 10% of patients in the Tarceva 100 mg plus gemcitabine group, are summarised by National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) Grade in Table 2.
8 The following terms are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency: very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000) including isolated reports.
The effect of Tarceva on overall survival was similar in patients with a baseline performance status (ECOG) of 2-3 (HR = 0.77, CI 0.6-1.0) or 0-1 (HR = 0.73, 0.6-0.9), male (HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-0.9) or female patients (HR = 0.80, CI 0.6-1.1), patients < 65 years of age (HR = 0.75, CI 0.6-0.9) or older patients (HR = 0.79, CI 0.6-1.0), patients with one prior regimen (HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-1.0) or more than one prior regimen (HR = 0.75, CI 0.6-1.0), Caucasian (HR = 0.79, CI 0.6-1.0) or Asian patients (HR = 0.61, 0.4-1.0), patients with adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.71, CI 0.6-0.9) or squamous cell carcinoma (HR = 0.67, CI 0.5-0.9), but not in patients with other histologies (HR 1.04, CI 0.7-1.5), patients with stage IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.92, CI 0.7-1.2) or < stage IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.65, 0.5-0.8).
In the 45% of patients with known EGFR-expression status, the hazard ratio was 0.68 (CI 0.49-0.94) for patients with EGFR-positive tumours and 0.93 (CI 0.63-1.36) for patients with EGFR-negative tumours (defined by IHC using EGFR pharmDx kit and defining EGFR-negative as less than 10% tumour cells staining).
Patients were randomised to receive Tarceva or placebo once daily on a continuous schedule plus gemcitabine IV (1000 mg/ m2, Cycle 1 - Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43 of an 8 week cycle; Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles - Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4 week cycle [approved dose and schedule for pancreatic cancer, see the gemcitabine SPC]).
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the patients were similar between the 2 treatment groups, 100 mg Tarceva plus gemcitabine or placebo plus gemcitabine, except for a slightly larger proportion of females in the erlotinib/ gemcitabine arm compared with the placebo/ gemcitabine arm:
In a study of 4 patients (3 with non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], and 1 with laryngeal cancer) receiving 150 mg daily oral doses of Tarceva, tumour samples from surgical excisions on Day 9 of treatment revealed tumour concentrations of erlotinib that averaged 1,185 ng/g of tissue.
In the pivotal Phase III NSCLC trial, current smokers achieved erlotinib steady state trough plasma concentration of 0.65 µg/mL (n=16) which was approximately 2-fold less than the former smokers or patients who had never smoked (1.28 µg/mL, n=108).
In patients with solid tumours and with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh score 7-9), geometric mean erlotinib AUC0-t and Cmax was 27000 ng•h/mL and 805 ng/mL, respectively, as compared to 29300 ng•h/mL and 1090 ng/mL in patients with adequate hepatic function including patients with primary liver cancer or hepatic metastases.
Chronic dosing effects observed in at least one animal species or study included effects on the cornea (atrophy, ulceration), skin (follicular degeneration and inflammation, redness, and alopecia), ovary (atrophy), liver (liver necrosis), kidney (renal papillary necrosis and tubular dilatation), and gastrointestinal tract (delayed gastric emptying and diarrhoea).
Data from reproductive toxicology tests in rats and rabbits at doses near the maximum tolerated dose and/or maternally toxic doses showed reproductive (embryotoxicity in rats, embryo resorption and foetotoxicity in rabbits) and developmental (decrease in pup growth and survival in rats) toxicity, but was not teratogenic and did not impair fertility.
Reported diagnoses in patients suspected of having ILD-like events included pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), alveolitis, and lung infiltration.
In more severe or persistent cases of diarrhoea, or cases leading to dehydration, particularly in groups of patients with aggravating risk factors (concomitant medications, symptoms or diseases or other predisposing conditions including advanced age), Tarceva therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to intensively rehydrate the patients intravenously.

21 Adverse events occurring more frequently (≥3%) in Tarceva-treated patients than in the placebo group in the pivotal study BR.21, and in at least 10% of patients in the Tarceva group, are summarised by National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) Grade in Table 1.
22 Adverse events occurring more frequently (≥3%) in Tarceva 100 mg plus gemcitabine-treated patients than in the placebo plus gemcitabine group in the pivotal study PA.3, and in at least 10% of patients in the Tarceva 100 mg plus gemcitabine group, are summarised by National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) Grade in Table 2.
23 The following terms are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency: very common (> 1/10); common (> 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000) including isolated reports.
The effect of Tarceva on overall survival was similar in patients with a baseline performance status (ECOG) of 2-3 (HR = 0.77, CI 0.6-1.0) or 0-1 (HR = 0.73, 0.6-0.9), male (HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-0.9) or female patients (HR = 0.80, CI 0.6-1.1), patients < 65 years of age (HR = 0.75, CI 0.6-0.9) or older patients (HR = 0.79, CI 0.6-1.0), patients with one prior regimen (HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-1.0) or more than one prior regimen (HR = 0.75, CI 0.6-1.0), Caucasian (HR = 0.79, CI 0.6-1.0) or Asian patients (HR = 0.61, 0.4-1.0), patients with adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.71, CI 0.6-0.9) or squamous cell carcinoma (HR = 0.67, CI 0.5-0.9), but not in patients with other histologies (HR 1.04, CI 0.7-1.5), patients with stage IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.92, CI 0.7-1.2) or < stage IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.65, 0.5-0.8).
In the 45% of patients with known EGFR-expression status, the hazard ratio was 0.68 (CI 0.49-0.94) for patients with EGFR-positive tumours and 0.93 (CI 0.63-1.36) for patients with EGFR-negative tumours (defined by IHC using EGFR pharmDx kit and defining EGFR-negative as less than 10% tumour cells staining).
Patients were randomised to receive Tarceva or placebo once daily on a continuous schedule plus gemcitabine IV (1000 mg/m2, Cycle 1 - Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43 of an 8 week cycle; Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles - Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4 week cycle [approved dose and schedule for pancreatic cancer, see the gemcitabine SPC]).
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the patients were similar between the 2 treatment groups, 100 mg Tarceva plus gemcitabine or placebo plus gemcitabine, except for a slightly larger proportion of females in the erlotinib/gemcitabine arm compared with the placebo/gemcitabine arm:
In a study of 4 patients (3 with non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], and 1 with laryngeal cancer) receiving 150 mg daily oral doses of Tarceva, tumour samples from surgical excisions on Day 9 of treatment revealed tumour concentrations of erlotinib that averaged 1,185 ng/g of tissue.
In the pivot al Phase III NSCLC trial, current smokers achieved erlotinib steady state trough plasma concentration of 0.65 µg/mL (n=16) which was approximately 2-fold less than the former smokers or patients who had never smoked (1.28 µg/mL, n=108).
In patients with solid tumours and with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh score 7-9), geometric mean erlotinib AUC0-t and Cmax was 27000 ng•h/mL and 805 ng/mL, respectively, as compared to 29300 ng•h/mL and 1090 ng/mL in patients with adequate hepatic function including patients with primary liver cancer or hepatic metastases.
Chronic dosing effects observed in at least one animal species or study included effects on the cornea (atrophy, ulceration), skin (follicular degeneration and inflammation, redness, and alopecia), ovary (atrophy), liver (liver necrosis), kidney (renal papillary necrosis and tubular dilatation), and gastrointestinal tract (delayed gastric emptying and diarrhoea).
Data from reproductive toxicology tests in rats and rabbits at doses near the maximum tolerated dose and/or maternally toxic doses showed reproductive (embryotoxicity in rats, embryo resorption and foetotoxicity in rabbits) and developmental (decrease in pup growth and survival in rats) toxicity, but was not teratogenic and did not impair fertility.
Reported diagnoses in patients suspected of having ILD-like events included pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), alveolitis, and lung infiltration.
In more severe or persistent cases of diarrhoea, or cases leading to dehydration, particularly in groups of patients with aggravating risk factors (concomitant medications, symptoms or diseases or other predisposing conditions including advanced age), Tarceva therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to intensively rehydrate the patients intravenously.
For patients who require concomitant treatment with Tarceva and a potent CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampicin an increase in dose to 300 mg should be considered while their safety (including renal and liver functions and serum electrolytes) is closely monitored, and if well tolerated for more than 2 weeks, further increase to 450 mg could be considered with close safety monitoring.
36 Adverse events occurring more frequently (≥3%) in Tarceva-treated patients than in the placebo group in the pivotal study BR.21, and in at least 10% of patients in the Tarceva group, are summarised by National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) Grade in Table 1.
37 Adverse events occurring more frequently (≥3%) in Tarceva 100 mg plus gemcitabine-treated patients than in the placebo plus gemcitabine group in the pivotal study PA.3, and in at least 10% of patients in the Tarceva 100 mg plus gemcitabine group, are summarised by National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) Grade in Table 2.
38 The following terms are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency: very common (> 1/10); common (> 1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000) including isolated reports.
The effect of Tarceva on overall survival was similar in patients with a baseline performance status (ECOG) of 2-3 (HR = 0.77, CI 0.6-1.0) or 0-1 (HR = 0.73, 0.6-0.9), male (HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-0.9) or female patients (HR = 0.80, CI 0.6-1.1), patients < 65 years of age (HR = 0.75, CI 0.6-0.9) or older patients (HR = 0.79, CI 0.6-1.0), patients with one prior regimen (HR = 0.76, CI 0.6-1.0) or more than one prior regimen (HR = 0.75, CI 0.6-1.0), Caucasian (HR = 0.79, CI 0.6-1.0) or Asian patients (HR = 0.61, 0.4-1.0), patients with adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.71, CI 0.6-0.9) or squamous cell carcinoma (HR = 0.67, CI 0.5-0.9), but not in patients with other histologies (HR 1.04, CI 0.7-1.5), patients with stage IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.92, CI 0.7-1.2) or < stage IV disease at diagnosis (HR = 0.65, 0.5-0.8).
In the 45% of patients with known EGFR-expression status, the hazard ratio was 0.68 (CI 0.49-0.94) for patients with EGFR-positive tumours and 0.93 (CI 0.63-1.36) for patients with EGFR-negative tumours (defined by IHC using EGFR pharmDx kit and defining EGFR-negative as less than 10% tumour cells staining).

The most common side effects in patients receiving TAXOTERE (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are neutropenia (reduced white blood cell counts), anaemia (reduced red blood cell counts), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), febrile neutropenia (neutropenia with fever), peripheral sensory neuropathy (damage to the nerves causing numbness, tingling and pain in the hands and feet), peripheral motor neuropathy (damage to the nerves causing difficulty co-ordinating movements), dysgeusia (taste disturbances), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth), diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, alopecia (hair loss), skin reactions, nail disorders, myalgia (muscle pain), anorexia (loss of appetite), infections, fluid retention, asthenia (weakness), pain and hypersensitivity (allergic reactions).
Gastric adenocarcinoma The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/ m2, as a 1 to 3 hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/ m2 per day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion.
• Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by cisplatin 75 mg/ m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at 750 mg/ m2 per day for five days.
• Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/ m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3 hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/ m2/ day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4.
In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil < 500 cells/ mm3 for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/ m2 to 75 mg/ m2 and/ or from 75 to 60 mg/ m².
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer In the pivotal trial in patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide prophylactic coverage (eg, day 4 to 11) in all subsequent cycles.
In combination with cisplatin For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/ mm3, or in patients who experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-hematologic toxicities, the docetaxel dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/ m2.
In combination with capecitabine • For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. • For patients developing the first appearance of a Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the next docetaxel/ capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at 100% of the original dose. • For patients developing the second appearance of a Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of a Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/ m². • For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel dose.
Patients with hepatic impairment Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/ m² as single agent, patients who have both elevations of transaminase (ALT and/ or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical trial excluded patients with ALT and/ or AST > 1.5 × ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.
In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/ m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels (ALT and/ or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia.
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical trial excluded patients with ALT and/ or AST > 1.5 × ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.
Among the 300 (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study, 74 were 65 years of age or older and 4 patients were 75 years of age or older.
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds which induce, inhibit or are metabolised by (and thus may inhibit the enzyme competitively) cytochrome P450-3A such as ciclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin and troleandomycin.
Although the possible in vivo interaction of docetaxel with concomitantly administered medication has not been investigated formally, in vitro interactions with tightly protein-bound agents such as erythromycin, diphenhydramine, propranolol, propafenone, phenytoin, salicylate, sulfamethoxazole and sodium valproate did not affect protein binding of docetaxel.
The adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of docetaxel have been obtained in: • 1312 and 121 patients who received 100 mg/ m² and 75 mg/ m² of docetaxel as a single agent respectively. • 258 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin. • 406 patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin. • 92 patients treated with docetaxel in combination with trastuzumab.
9 • 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. • 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). • 744 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). • 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). • 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented).
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/ mm3) was 7 days), anemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea and asthenia.
Very common adverse Common adverse reactions reactions ≥ 10% of patients ≥ 1 to < 10% of patients G3/ 4 Blood bilirubin increased (< 5%); G3/ 4 Blood alkaline phosphatase increased (< 4%); G3/ 4 AST increased (< 3%); G3/ 4 ALT increased (< 2%)
After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/ m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/ m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/ m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/ m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/ m2 (FAC arm).
Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival (15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03).
One large randomized phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/ m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/ m²) (AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/ m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/ m²) (AC arm).
In this trial, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia (8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm.
On the other hand, AC arm showed a higher incidence of severe anemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%).
There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other disease-related medications (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/ m² compared to those with BSC.
In a phase III trial, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either docetaxel (T) 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/ m2 over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ ml. min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/ m2 administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/ m2 administered on day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks.
A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥ 60 were randomized to the following treatment groups: • Docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. • Docetaxel 30 mg/ m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. • Mitoxantrone 12 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles.

A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) (75 mg/ m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/ m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/ m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/ m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/ m2 per day for 5 days).
Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF.
Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/ hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week).
32 • Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter open-label, phase III, trial (TAX324).
Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/ m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/ m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/ m²/ day from day 1 to day 4.
In a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver function impairment (ALT, AST ≥ 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).
Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5’ -DFUR.
Gastric adenocarcinoma The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/ m2, as a 1 to 3 hour infusion (both on day 1 only), followed by 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/ m2 per day given as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 5 days, starting at the end of the cisplatin infusion.
• Induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (TAX 323) For the induction treatment of inoperable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by cisplatin 75 mg/ m2 over 1 hour, on day one, followed by 5-fluorouracil as a continuous infusion at 750 mg/ m2 per day for five days.
• Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX 324) For the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced (technically unresectable, low probability of surgical cure, and aiming at organ preservation) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin 100 mg/ m2 administered as a 30-minute to 3 hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/ m2/ day as a continuous infusion from day 1 to day 4.
In patients who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil < 500 cells/ mm3 for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or severe peripheral neuropathy during docetaxel therapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100 mg/ m2 to 75 mg/ m2 and/ or from 75 to 60 mg/ m².
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer In the pivotal trial in patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and who experienced complicated neutropenia (including prolonged neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection), it was recommended to use G-CSF to provide prophylactic coverage (eg, day 4 to 11) in all subsequent cycles.
In combination with cisplatin For patients who are dosed initially at docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 in combination with cisplatin and whose nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells/ mm3, or in patients who experience febrile neutropenia, or in patients with serious non-hematologic toxicities, the docetaxel dose in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg/ m2.
In combination with capecitabine • For capecitabine dose modifications, see capecitabine summary of product characteristics. • For patients developing the first appearance of a Grade 2 toxicity, which persists at the time of the next docetaxel/ capecitabine treatment, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, and resume at 100% of the original dose. • For patients developing the second appearance of a Grade 2 toxicity, or the first appearance of a Grade 3 toxicity, at any time during the treatment cycle, delay treatment until resolved to Grade 0-1, then resume treatment with docetaxel 55 mg/ m². • For any subsequent appearances of toxicities, or any Grade 4 toxicities, discontinue the docetaxel dose.
Patients with hepatic impairment Based on pharmacokinetic data with docetaxel at 100 mg/ m² as single agent, patients who have both elevations of transaminase (ALT and/ or AST) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 times the ULN, the recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/ m2 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
In combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, the pivotal clinical trial excluded patients with ALT and/ or AST > 1.5 × ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN, and bilirubin > 1 x ULN; for these patients, no dose-reductions can be recommended and docetaxel should not be used unless strictly indicated.
In patients treated with docetaxel at 100 mg/ m2 as single agent who have serum transaminase levels (ALT and/ or AST) greater than 1.5 times the ULN concurrent with serum alkaline phosphatase levels greater than 2.5 times the ULN, there is a higher risk of developing severe adverse reactions such as toxic deaths including sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage which can be fatal, febrile neutropenia, infections, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis and asthenia.

46 • 255 patients who received docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. • 332 patients who received docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). • 744 patients who received docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). • 300 gastric adenocarcinoma patients (221 patients in the phase III part of the study and 79 patients in the phase II part) who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented). • 174 and 251 head and neck cancer patients who received docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (clinically important treatment related adverse events are presented).
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of docetaxel alone are: neutropenia (which was reversible and not cumulative; the median day to nadir was 7 days and the median duration of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/ mm3) was 7 days), anemia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea and asthenia.
Very common adverse Common adverse reactions reactions ≥ 10% of patients ≥ 1 to < 10% of patients G3/ 4 Blood bilirubin increased (< 5%); G3/ 4 Blood alkaline phosphatase increased (< 4%); G3/ 4 AST increased (< 3%); G3/ 4 ALT increased (< 2%)
After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/ m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/ m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/ m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/ m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/ m2 (FAC arm).
Without affecting the primary endpoint, overall response rate (32% vs 25%, p = 0.10), docetaxel prolonged median time to progression (24.6 weeks vs 15.6 weeks; p < 0.01) and median survival (15.3 months vs 12.7 months; p = 0.03).
One large randomized phase III study, involving 429 previously untreated patients with metastatic disease, has been performed with doxorubicin (50 mg/ m²) in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/ m²) (AT arm) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/ m²) in combination with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/ m²) (AC arm).
In this trial, AT arm showed a higher incidence of severe neutropenia (90% versus 68.6%), febrile neutropenia (33.3% versus 10%), infection (8% versus 2.4%), diarrhea (7.5% versus 1.4%), asthenia (8.5% versus 2.4%), and pain (2.8% versus 0%) than AC arm.
On the other hand, AC arm showed a higher incidence of severe anemia (15.8% versus 8.5%) than AT arm, and, in addition, a higher incidence of severe cardiac toxicity: congestive heart failure (3.8% versus 2.8%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 20% (13.1% versus 6.1%), absolute LVEF decrease ≥ 30% (6.2% versus 1.1%).
There was less use of morphinic analgesic (p < 0.01), non-morphinic analgesics (p < 0.01), other disease-related medications (p = 0.06) and radiotherapy (p < 0.01) in patients treated with docetaxel at 75 mg/ m² compared to those with BSC.
In a phase III trial, 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, with KPS of 70% or greater, and who did not receive previous chemotherapy for this condition, were randomised to either docetaxel (T) 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin (Cis) 75 mg/ m2 over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 as a 1 hour infusion in combination with carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/ ml. min) over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks, or vinorelbine (V) 25 mg/ m2 administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/ m2 administered on day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks.
A total of 1006 patients with KPS ≥ 60 were randomized to the following treatment groups: • Docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles. • Docetaxel 30 mg/ m2 administered weekly for the first 5 weeks in a 6 week cycle for 5 cycles. • Mitoxantrone 12 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles.

A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel (T) (75 mg/ m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/ m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/ m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/ m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/ m2 per day for 5 days).
Patients treated with TCF had a longer time to 5% definitive deterioration of global health status on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (p = 0.0121) and a longer time to definitive worsening of Karnofsky performance status (p = 0.0088) compared to patients treated with CF.
Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction (1.8 Gy - 2.0 Gy once a day, 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy), or accelerated/ hyperfractionated regimens of radiation therapy (twice a day, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, 5 days per week).
• Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (TAX324) The safety and efficacy of docetaxel in the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter open-label, phase III, trial (TAX324).
Patients on the docetaxel arm received docetaxel (T) 75 mg/ m² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/ m² administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/ m²/ day from day 1 to day 4.
In a small number of patients (n = 23) with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver function impairment (ALT, AST ≥ 1.5 times the ULN associated with alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 times the ULN), total clearance was lowered by 27% on average (see section 4.2).
Phase I study evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of a relevant capecitabine metabolite 5’ -DFUR.

On 14 November 2008, Sanofi-Aventis Pharma S. A. officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a new indication for Taxotere/ Docetaxel Winthrop, to add the treatment of patients with operable breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2 in combination with trastuzumab, with or without carboplatin.
Taxotere/ Docetaxel Winthrop was also expected to be used to treat breast cancer that can be treated with surgery when the cancer has been shown to be ‘ expressing’ large amounts of HER2: this is a type of cancer that produces (expresses) a specific protein called HER2 in large quantities on the surface of the tumour cells.
Taxotere/ Docetaxel Winthrop was expected to be used in addition to surgery to remove the tumour in the following treatment combinations: • together with trastuzumab (another anticancer medicine), following treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; • together with trastuzumab and carboplatin (another anticancer medicine).
Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. • the combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for 12 weeks, followed by Taxotere/ Docetaxel Winthrop for 12 weeks, either alone or in combination with trastuzumab; • the combination of Taxotere/ Docetaxel Winthrop, trastuzumab and carboplatin for 18 weeks.
Based on the review of the data and the company’ s response to the CHMP list of questions, at the time of the withdrawal, the CHMP had given a negative opinion and did not recommend a marketing authorisation for Taxotere/ Docetaxel Winthrop in the treatment of patients with operable breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2 in combination with trastuzumab, with or without carboplatin.
Cholestagel co-administered with a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to provide an additive reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia who are not adequately controlled with a statin alone.
Prior to initiating therapy with Cholestagel, if secondary causes of hypercholesterolaemia (i. e., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinaemias, obstructive liver disease) are considered, these should be diagnosed and properly treated.
This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effects of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors.
Multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 487 patients demonstrated an additive reduction of 8 to 16% in LDL-C when 2.3 to 3.8 g Cholestagel and a statin (atorvastatin, lovastatin or simvastatin) were administered at the same time.
These could include poorly controlled diabetes, untreated hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone for which no treatment is being given currently), proteins in urine (nephrotic syndrome), altered protein levels in the blood (dysproteinaemias), and blockage of the bile transport to your gall bladder (obstructive liver disease).
Cholestagel may affect the way in which the following medicines work: • Anticoagulant therapy (medicines, such as warfarin, used to thin blood) • Thyroid replacement therapy (medicines, such as thyroxine or levothyroxine, used to treat low thyroid hormone levels) • Oral contraceptives (medicines to prevent pregnancy) It is important you take Cholestagel at least 4 hours after you take the oral contraceptive to ensure that the effectiveness of the contraceptive is not affected. • Verapamil (a medicine used to treat high blood pressure) • Antidiabetic medications (medicines, such as pioglitazone, repaglinide or glyburide used to treat diabetes) • Anti-epileptic medicines (medicines, such as phenytoin, used to treat epilepsy). • Ciclosporin (a medicine used to suppress the immune system).
Cholestagel is used to lower cholesterol levels in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol levels). ‘ Primary ’ means that there is no disease causing the high cholesterol levels. • Cholestagel is used as an add-on to a cholesterol-lowering diet, to reduce total cholesterol and ‘ low-density-lipoprotein’ (LDL or ‘ bad ’) cholesterol levels in patients in whom a statin (another cholesterol-lowering medicine) is not appropriate or is not well tolerated; • Cholestagel is also used as an add-on to a statin and a cholesterol-lowering diet, to further reduce LDL-cholesterol levels in patients who are not adequately controlled with a statin alone.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Cholestagel’ s benefits are greater than its risks as adjunctive therapy to diet to provide additive reduction in LDL cholesterol levels in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia who are not adequately controlled with a statin alone, and as adjunctive therapy to diet for reduction of elevated total-cholesterol and LDL- cholesterol in adult patients with isolated primary hypercholesterolaemia, in whom a statin is considered inappropriate or is not well tolerated.

Take off the pen cap (as shown by the arrow). • Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab • Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination • Remove the protective tab from a NovoFine S short cap needle • Screw the needle straight and tightly onto NovoRapid InnoLet (picture 1A) • Pull off the big outer needle cap and the inner needle cap.
To avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: • Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector clockwise • Hold NovoRapid InnoLet with the needle upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge • Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button and the dose selector returns to zero • A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip (picture 1B).
You will hear clicks as the dose selector returns to zero • After the injection, the needle must remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the full dose has been delivered • Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed to return to zero when you press the push-button.
It is used as an add-on to existing asthma treatment in adults and adolescents over the age of 12 years, who must: • have had a positive skin test result for an allergy caused by an allergen (a stimulus that causes an allergy) in the air, such as house dust mites, pollen or mould, • have reduced lung function (less than 80% of normal), as well as frequent symptoms during the day or waking up during the night, and, • have had many severe ‘ exacerbations ’ of asthma (where asthma got worse, requiring rescue treatment with other medicines) despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.

Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who have reduced lung function (FEV1 < 80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.
Clinical experience The efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Further evaluations which did show statistical significance (p < 0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’ s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma symptoms and lung function.
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/ kg (about 12-fold exposure ratio based on 28-day AUC values at 75 mg/ kg versus the clinical maximum dose) did not elicit maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, delivery and nursing.

Xolair is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe allergic asthma in adults or adolescents (12 years of age and older) who are already receiving asthma medication, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose steroid inhalers or beta-agonist inhalers.
If you notice any serious sudden sign of allergy or combination of signs such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, fast heart beat, dizziness and light-headedness, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing, or any other new symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse immediately.
Not known • Development of any combination of the following symptoms: pain, numbness, tingling in the arms and legs, lumps or raised patches in the skin, worsening problems with breathing, nasal congestion (signs of so-called “ Churg-Strauss syndrome”). • Low blood platelet count with symptoms such as bleeding or bruising more easily than normal. • Development of any of the following symptoms, especially if in combination: joint pain with or without swelling, rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes, muscle pain, (signs of serum sickness).

NMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e. g. agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase.
Thus, entacapone should be administered cautiously to patients being treated with medicinal products metabolised by catechol-O- methyl transferase (COMT), e. g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine (see also section 4.5).
However, the experience of the clinical use of entacapone with several medicinal products, including MAO-A inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline and venlafaxine, and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e. g. catechol- structured compounds: rimiterol, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, and paroxetine) is still limited.
Patients being treated with entacapone in association with levodopa and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see also section 4.4).
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical trials or epidemiological studies).
Parkinson’ s disease patients treated with dopamine agonists and other dopaminergic treatments such as entacapone in association with levodopa, especially at high doses, have been reported as exhibiting signs of pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality, which were generally reversible upon reduction of the dose or treatment discontinuation.
Very common (affects more than 1 patient in 10) Common (affects 1 to 10 patients in 100) Uncommon (affects 1 to 10 patients in 1,000) Rare (affects 1 to 10 patients in 10,000) Very rare (affects less than 1 patient in 10,000) Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)
Common Uncontrollable movements (hyperkinesias), being sick (vomiting), worsening of symptoms of Parkinson’ s disease, dizziness, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, hallucinations (seeing/ hearing/ feeling/ smelling things that are not really there), prolonged muscle contractions (dystonia), tiredness, increased sweating, sleeplessness, vivid dreams, fall and confusion.
Comtan should not be used in patients with: • liver disease; • phaeochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland); • a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a dangerous nervous system disorder usually caused by antipsychotic medicines) or rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle fibres).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Comtan’ s benefits are greater than its risks as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/ benserazide or levodopa/ carbidopa for use in patients with Parkinson’ s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.
Refractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days of prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy. • Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections (such as Candida or Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult or paediatric patients.
When CANCIDAS is co-administered to paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years of age) with these same inducers of metabolic enzymes (see section 4.5), a CANCIDAS dose of 70-mg/ m2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) should be considered.
Some healthy adult volunteers who received two 3 mg/ kg doses of cyclosporin with caspofungin showed transient increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) of less than or equal to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) that resolved with discontinuation of the treatment.
Limited data from population pharmacokinetics studies indicate that concomitant use of CANCIDAS with the inducers efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, or carbamazepine may result in a decrease in caspofungin AUC.
When CANCIDAS is co-administered to paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years of age) with inducers of drug clearance, such as rifampicin, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, a CANCIDAS dose of 70-mg/ m2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) should be considered.
Common: elevated liver values (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin), increased serum creatinine, decreased haemoglobin, decreased haematocrit, blood potassium decreased, hypomagnesaemia, low albumin, decreased white blood cells, increased eosinophils, platelet count decreased, decreased neutrophils, increased urinary red blood cells, increased partial thromboplastin time, decreased total serum protein, increased urinary protein, increased prothrombin time, blood sodium decreased, increased urinary white blood cells and low calcium.
Caspofungin has in vitro activity against Aspergillus species (Aspergillus fumigatus [N = 75], Aspergillus flavus [N = 111], Aspergillus niger [N = 31], Aspergillus nidulans [N = 8], Aspergillus terreus [N = 52], and Aspergillus candidus [N = 3]).
Caspofungin also has in vitro activity against Candida species (Candida albicans [N = 1032], Candida dubliniensis [N = 100], Candida glabrata [N = 151], Candida guilliermondii [N = 67], Candida kefyr [N = 62], Candida krusei [N = 147], Candida lipolytica [N = 20], Candida lusitaniae [N = 80], Candida parapsilosis [N = 215], Candida rugosa [N = 1], and Candida tropicalis [N = 258]), including isolates with multiple resistance transport mutations and those with acquired or intrinsic resistance to fluconazole, amphotericin B, and 5-flucytosine.
Two hundred twenty-four patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) of response at the end of IV study therapy; favourable response rates for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were comparable for caspofungin (73% [80/ 109]) and amphotericin B (62% [71/ 115]) [% difference 12.7 (95.6% CI -0.7, 26.0)].
Among patients with candidaemia, favourable response rates at the end of IV study therapy were comparable for caspofungin (72% [66/ 92]) and amphotericin B (63% [59/ 94]) in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) [% difference 10.0 (95.0% CI -4.5, 24.5)].
Although the doses of prior antifungal therapies in 5 patients enrolled as refractory were lower than those often administered for invasive aspergillosis, the favourable response rate during therapy with caspofungin was similar in these patients to that seen in the remaining refractory patients (2/ 5 versus 17/ 48, respectively).
If the drug was well tolerated but the patient’ s fever persisted and clinical condition deteriorated after 5 days of therapy, the dosage of study drug could be increased to 70 mg/ day of caspofungin (13.3% of patients treated) or to 5.0 mg/ kg/ day of liposomal amphotericin B (14.3% of patients treated).
There were 1095 patients included in the primary Modified Intention-To-Treat (MITT) efficacy analysis of overall favourable response; caspofungin (33.9%) was as effective as liposomal amphotericin B (33.7%) [% difference 0.2 (95.2% CI – 5.6, 6.0)].
(1) successful treatment of any baseline fungal infection (caspofungin 51.9% [14/ 27], liposomal amphotericin B 25.9% [7/ 27]), (2) no breakthrough fungal infections during administration of study drug or within 7 days after completion of treatment (caspofungin 94.8% [527/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 95.5% [515/ 539]), (3) survival for 7 days after completion of study therapy (caspofungin 92.6% [515/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 89.2% [481/ 539]), (4) no discontinuation from the study drug because of drug-related toxicity or lack of efficacy (caspofungin 89.7% [499/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 85.5% [461/ 539]), and (5) resolution of fever during the period of neutropaenia (caspofungin 41.2% [229/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 41.4% [223/ 539]).
Response rates to caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B for baseline infections caused by Aspergillus species were, respectively, 41.7% (5/ 12) and 8.3% (1/ 12), and by Candida species were 66.7% (8/ 12) and 41.7% (5/ 12).
The first study, which enrolled 82 patients between 2 to 17 years of age, was a randomized, double- blind study comparing CANCIDAS (50 mg/ m2 IV once daily following a 70-mg/ m2 loading dose on Day 1 [not to exceed 70 mg daily]) to liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/ kg IV daily) in a 2:1 treatment fashion (56 on caspofungin, 26 on liposomal amphotericin B) as empirical therapy in paediatric patients with persistent fever and neutropenia.
Moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 49 ml/ min), advanced (creatinine clearance 5 to 30 ml/ min), and end-stage (creatinine clearance < 10 ml/ min and dialysis dependent) renal insufficiency moderately increased caspofungin plasma concentrations after single-dose administration (range:
In young children and toddlers (ages 12 to 23 months) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/ m2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24hr after multiple doses was comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg daily and to that in older children (2 to 11 years of age) receiving the 50 mg/ m2 daily dose.
Pharmacokinetic data from one 10-month old child receiving the 50 mg/ m2 daily dose indicated an AUC0-24hr within the same range as that observed in older children and adults at the 50 mg/ m2 and the 50 mg dose, respectively, while in one 6-month old child receiving the 50 mg/ m2 dose, the AUC0-24hr was somewhat higher.
In neonates and infants (< 3 months) receiving caspofungin at 25 mg/ m2 daily (corresponding mean daily dose of 2.1 mg/ kg), caspofungin peak concentration (C1 hr) and caspofungin trough concentration (C24 hr) after multiple doses were comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg daily.
Developmental toxicity studies in rats showed that caspofungin caused decreases in foetal body weights and an increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of vertebra, sternebra, and skull bone at doses of 5 mg/ kg that were coupled to adverse maternal effects such as signs of histamine release in pregnant rats.
Stability data have shown that the product can be used within 24 hours when stored at 25°C or less, or within 48 hours when the intravenous infusion bag (bottle) is stored refrigerated (2 to 8°C) and diluted with sodium chloride solution 9 mg/ ml (0.9%), 4.5 mg/ ml (0.45%), or 2.25 mg/ ml (0.225%) for infusion, or lactated Ringer’ s solution.
Chemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution in sterile lactated Ringer’ s solution and sodium chloride solution 9 mg/ ml (0.9%), 4.5 mg/ ml (0.45%), and 2.25 mg/ ml (0.225%) for infusion has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25°C and for 48 hours at 2 to 8°C.
Aseptically add 10.5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, Sterile Water for Injection or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with methylparaben and propylparaben. a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to one hour at ≤ 25°C (≤ 77°F). b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of 5.2 mg/ ml.

Two hundred twenty-four patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) of response at the end of IV study therapy; favourable response rates for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were comparable for caspofungin (73% [80/ 109]) and amphotericin B (62% [71/ 115]) [% difference 12.7 (95.6% CI -0.7, 26.0)].
Among patients with candidaemia, favourable response rates at the end of IV study therapy were comparable for caspofungin (72% [66/ 92]) and amphotericin B (63% [59/ 94]) in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) [% difference 10.0 (95.0% CI -4.5, 24.5)].
Although the doses of prior antifungal therapies in 5 patients enrolled as refractory were lower than those often administered for invasive aspergillosis, the favourable response rate during therapy with caspofungin was similar in these patients to that seen in the remaining refractory patients (2/ 5 versus 17/ 48, respectively).
If the drug was well tolerated but the patient’ s fever persisted and clinical condition deteriorated after 5 days of therapy, the dosage of study drug could be increased to 70 mg/ day of caspofungin (13.3% of patients treated) or to 5.0 mg/ kg/ day of liposomal amphotericin B (14.3% of patients treated).
There were 1095 patients included in the primary Modified Intention-To-Treat (MITT) efficacy analysis of overall favourable response; caspofungin (33.9%) was as effective as liposomal amphotericin B (33.7%) [% difference 0.2 (95.2% CI – 5.6, 6.0)].
(1) successful treatment of any baseline fungal infection (caspofungin 51.9% [14/ 27], liposomal amphotericin B 25.9% [7/ 27]), (2) no breakthrough fungal infections during administration of study drug or within 7 days after completion of treatment (caspofungin 94.8% [527/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 95.5% [515/ 539]), (3) survival for 7 days after completion of study therapy (caspofungin 92.6% [515/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 89.2% [481/ 539]), (4) no discontinuation from the study drug because of drug-related toxicity or lack of efficacy (caspofungin 89.7% [499/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 85.5% [461/ 539]), and (5) resolution of fever during the period of neutropaenia (caspofungin 41.2% [229/ 556], liposomal amphotericin B 41.4% [223/ 539]).
Response rates to caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B for baseline infections caused by Aspergillus species were, respectively, 41.7% (5/ 12) and 8.3% (1/ 12), and by Candida species were 66.7% (8/ 12) and 41.7% (5/ 12).
The first study, which enrolled 82 patients between 2 to 17 years of age, was a randomized, double- blind study comparing CANCIDAS (50 mg/ m2 IV once daily following a 70-mg/ m2 loading dose on Day 1 [not to exceed 70 mg daily]) to liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/ kg IV daily) in a 2:1 treatment fashion (56 on caspofungin, 26 on liposomal amphotericin B) as empirical therapy in paediatric patients with persistent fever and neutropenia.
Moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 49 ml/ min), advanced (creatinine clearance 5 to 30 ml/ min), and end-stage (creatinine clearance < 10 ml/ min and dialysis dependent) renal insufficiency moderately increased caspofungin plasma concentrations after single-dose administration (range:
In young children and toddlers (ages 12 to 23 months) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/ m2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24hr after multiple doses was comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg daily and to that in older children (2 to 11 years of age) receiving the 50 mg/ m2 daily dose.
Pharmacokinetic data from one 10-month old child receiving the 50 mg/ m2 daily dose indicated an AUC0-24hr within the same range as that observed in older children and adults at the 50 mg/ m2 and the 50 mg dose, respectively, while in one 6-month old child receiving the 50 mg/ m2 dose, the AUC0-24hr was somewhat higher.
In neonates and infants (< 3 months) receiving caspofungin at 25 mg/ m2 daily (corresponding mean daily dose of 2.1 mg/ kg), caspofungin peak concentration (C1 hr) and caspofungin trough concentration (C24 hr) after multiple doses were comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg daily.
Developmental toxicity studies in rats showed that caspofungin caused decreases in foetal body weights and an increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of vertebra, sternebra, and skull bone at doses of 5 mg/ kg that were coupled to adverse maternal effects such as signs of histamine release in pregnant rats.

These yeast cells are normally found in the digestive tract, and do not cause an infection unless they enter the bloodstream (in which case the infection is referred to as candidaemia) or other tissues or organs, such as the lining of the abdomen (peritonitis), the heart, the kidneys, the liver, bones, muscles, joints, spleen, or eyes.
It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking certain anti-HIV medicines (including efavirenz or nevirapine), the antiseizure (epilepsy) medicines phenytoin and carbamazepine, the steroid dexamethasone, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the immunosuppressant tacrolimus.

It is used to treat adults, adolescents and children with: • invasive candidiasis (a type of fungal infection due to Candida); • invasive aspergillosis (another type of fungal infection due to Aspergillus) when the patient does not respond to or does not tolerate amphotericin B or itraconazole (other antifungal medicines); • suspected fungal infections (such as due to Candida or Aspergillus) when the patient is febrile (feverish) and neutropenic (lacking white blood cells).
Three studies looked at the effects of Cancidas in the treatment of invasive candidiasis or aspergillosis: one study involved 239 adults with invasive candidiasis, another involved 69 adults with invasive aspergillosis, and the third involved 49 patients aged between six months and 17 years with either candidiasis or aspergillosis.

The most commonly reported side effects with TRISENOX (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are neutropenia (low levels of white blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets), hyperglycaemia (raised blood sugar levels), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels), paraesthesia (pins and needles), pleuritic pain (chest pain), dyspnoea (breathlessness), bone pain, arthralgia (joint pain), pyrexia (fever), fatigue (tiredness), prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram (irregular heart beat), and increased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (liver enzymes).
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that TRISENOX’ s benefits are greater than its risks for induction of remission and consolidation in adult patients with relapsed/ refractory APL, characterised by the presence of the t(15; 17) translocation and/ or the presence of the Pro-Myelocytic Leukaemia/ Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha (PML/ RAR-alpha) gene, when previous treatment has included a retinoid and chemotherapy.
TRISENOX is indicated for induction of remission and consolidation in adult patients with relapsed/ refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), characterised by the presence of the t(15; 17) translocation and/ or the presence of the Pro-Myelocytic Leukaemia/ Retinoic-Acid-Receptor- alpha (PML/ RAR-alpha) gene.
Twenty-five percent of patients with APL treated with TRISENOX have experienced symptoms similar to a syndrome called the retinoic-acid-acute promyelocytic leukaemia (RA-APL) or APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis.
At the first signs that could suggest the syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnoea and/ or weight gain, abnormal chest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities), high-dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously twice a day) must be immediately initiated, irrespective of the leukocyte count and continued for at least 3 days or longer until signs and symptoms have abated.
The risk of torsade de pointes is related to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal products (such as class Ia and III antiarrythmics (e. g. quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide), antipsychotics (e. g. thioridazine), antidepressants (e. g. amitriptyline), some macrolides (e. g. erythromycin), some antihistamines (e. g. terfenadine and astemizole), some quinolone antibiotics (e. g. sparfloxacin), and other individual drugs known to increase QT interval (e. g. cisapride)), a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, amphotericin B or other conditions that result in hypokalemia or hypomagnesaemia.
Prior to initiating therapy with TRISENOX, a 12-lead ECG must be performed and serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and creatinine must be assessed; preexisting electrolyte abnormalities must be corrected and, if possible, medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT interval must be discontinued.
If syncope, rapid or irregular heartbeat develops, the patient must be hospitalised and monitored continuously, serum electrolytes must be assessed, TRISENOX therapy must be temporarily discontinued until the QTc interval regresses to below 460 msec, electrolyte abnormalities are corrected, and the syncope and irregular heartbeat cease.
Those serious adverse reactions attributed to TRISENOX included APL differentiation syndrome (3), leukocytosis (3), prolonged QT interval (4, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter (1), hyperglycaemia (2) and a variety of serious adverse reactions related to haemorrhage, infections, pain, diarrhoea, nausea.
During TRISENOX treatment, 13 of the 52 patients in the APL studies had one or more symptoms of APL differentiation syndrome, characterised by fever, dyspnoea, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural or pericardial effusions, with or without leukocytosis (see Section 4.4).
The risk of torsade de pointes is related to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of QT prolonging medicinal products, a history of torsade de pointes, preexisting QT interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
The metabolism of arsenic trioxide involves oxidation of arsenious acid (AsIII), the active species of arsenic trioxide, to arsenic acid (AsV), as well as oxidative methylation to monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) by methyltransferases, primarily in the liver.
In vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes revealed that arsenic trioxide has no inhibitory activity on substrates of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes such as 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/ 5, 4A9/ 11.
Phase III randomized study of concurrent tretinoin and chemotherapy with or without arsenic trioxide (As2O3) as initial consolidation therapy followed by maintenance with intermittent tretinoin therapy versus intermittent tretinoin plus mercaptopurine and methotrexate for patients with untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia.
While on treatment with TRISENOX, you may experience some of the following reactions: common side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in 100 but less than 1 in 10): fatigue (weariness), increased blood sugar, shortness of breath, cough, headache. uncommon side effects (greater than or equal to 1 in 1000 but less than 1 in 100): increased white blood cell count, Herpes zoster, pneumonia, sepsis, anaemia, dehydration, confusion, blurry vision, cardiac failure, hypotension, pneumonitis, chills, renal failure, increased weight, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach ache, oedema (water retention), rash or itching, change in your heart rhythm or dizziness.
In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.

Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
9 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Copalia regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7– 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
11 In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.

To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
Alopecia, altered bowel habits, dyspepsia, dyspnoea, rhinitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia, gynaecomastia, hyperglycaemia, impotence, increased urinary frequency, leucopenia, malaise, mood changes, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, angioedema and erythema multiforme.
Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
33 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Copalia regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7– 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
35 In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.

Medicinal products that may prolong QTc interval, including vardenafil, are best avoided in patients with relevant risk factors, for example, hypokalaemia; congenital QT prolongation; concomitant administration of antiarrhythmic medicinal products in Class 1ª (e. g. quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (e. g. amiodarone, sotalol).
The pharmacokinetics of vardenafil (20 mg) was not affected by co-administration with the H2-antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), digoxin, warfarin, glibenclamide, alcohol (mean maximum blood alcohol level of 73 mg/ dl) or single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/ aluminium hydroxide).
Although specific interaction studies were not conducted for all medicinal products, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect on vardenafil pharmacokinetics of the following concomitant medicinal products: acetylsalicylic acid, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, weak CYP 3A4 inhibitors, diuretics and medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes (sulfonylureas and metformin).
No potentiation of the blood pressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) was observed when vardenafil (10 mg) was given at varying time intervals (1 h to 24 h) prior to the dose of nitroglycerin in a study in 18 healthy male subjects.
Based on the results of interaction studies conducted with vardenafil in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on stable tamsulosin or terazosin therapy: • When vardenafil was given at doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg on a background of stable therapy with tamsulosin, there was no symptomatic reduction in blood pressure, although 3/ 21 tamsulosin treated subjects exhibited transient standing systolic blood pressures of less than 85 mmHg. • When vardenafil 5 mg was given simultaneously with terazosin 5 or 10 mg, one of 21 patients experienced symptomatic postural hypotension.
In a specific study, where vardenafil (20 mg) was co-administered with slow release nifedipine (30 mg or 60 mg) in hypertensive patients, there was an additional reduction on supine systolic blood pressure of 6 mmHg and supine diastolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg accompanied with an increase in heart rate of 4 bpm.
*For adverse reactions reported in < 1% of patients, only those which warrant special attention, because of their possible association with serious disease states or of otherwise clinical relevance are listed. **Sudden deafness or loss of hearing has been reported in a small number of postmarketing and clinical trial cases with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil.
In vitro studies have shown that vardenafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases (> 15-fold relative to PDE6, > 130-fold relative to PDE1, > 300-fold relative to PDE11, and > 1000-fold relative to PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9 and PDE10).
The primary objective of this study was to rule out a greater than 10 msec effect (i. e. to demonstrate lack of effect) of a single 80 mg oral dose of vardenafil on QTc interval compared to placebo, as measured by the change in Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF=QT/ RR1/ 3) from baseline at the 1 hour post-dose time point.
In pooled data from the major efficacy trials, the proportion of patients experiencing successful penetration on vardenafil were as follows: psychogenic erectile dysfunction (77-87%), mixed erectile dysfunction (69-83%), organic erectile dysfunction (64-75%), elderly (52-75%), ischaemic heart disease (70-73%), hyperlipidemia (62-73%), chronic pulmonary disease (74-78%), depression (59-69%), and patients concomitantly treated with antihypertensives (62-73%).
Medicinal products that may prolong QTc interval, including vardenafil, are best avoided in patients with relevant risk factors, for example, hypokalaemia; congenital QT prolongation; concomitant administration of antiarrhythmic medicinal products in Class 1ª (e. g. quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (e. g. amiodarone, sotalol).

In vitro studies have shown that vardenafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases (> 15-fold relative to PDE6, > 130-fold relative to PDE1, > 300-fold relative to PDE11, and > 1000-fold relative to PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9 and PDE10).
The primary objective of this study was to rule out a greater than 10 msec effect (i. e. to demonstrate lack of effect) of a single 80 mg oral dose of vardenafil on QTc interval compared to placebo, as measured by the change in Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF=QT/ RR1/ 3) from baseline at the 1 hour post-dose time point.
In pooled data from the major efficacy trials, the proportion of patients experiencing successful penetration on vardenafil were as follows: psychogenic erectile dysfunction (77-87%), mixed erectile dysfunction (69-83%), organic erectile dysfunction (64-75%), elderly (52-75%), ischaemic heart disease (70-73%), hyperlipidemia (62-73%), chronic pulmonary disease (74-78%), depression (59-69%), and patients concomitantly treated with antihypertensives (62-73%).
Medicinal products that may prolong QTc interval, including vardenafil, are best avoided in patients with relevant risk factors, for example, hypokalaemia; congenital QT prolongation; concomitant administration of antiarrhythmic medicinal products in Class 1ª (e. g. quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (e. g. amiodarone, sotalol).
The pharmacokinetics of vardenafil (20 mg) was not affected by co-administration with the H2-antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), digoxin, warfarin, glibenclamide, alcohol (mean maximum blood alcohol level of 73 mg/ dl) or single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/ aluminium hydroxide).
Although specific interaction studies were not conducted for all medicinal products, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect on vardenafil pharmacokinetics of the following concomitant medicinal products: acetylsalicylic acid, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, weak CYP 3A4 inhibitors, diuretics and medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes (sulfonylureas and metformin).
No potentiation of the blood pressure lowering effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) was observed when vardenafil (10 mg) was given at varying time intervals (1 h to 24 h) prior to the dose of nitroglycerin in a study in 18 healthy male subjects.

What AZOPT looks like and the contents of the pack AZOPT is a milky liquid (a suspension) supplied in a pack containing a 5 ml or a 10 ml plastic (droptainer) bottle with a screw cap, or in a pack containing three 5 ml plastic (droptainer) bottles with screw caps.
It is available as a 5 mg tablet, a 5 mg oral lyophilisate (dispersible tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg orodispersible tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), a 0.5 mg/ ml syrup and a 0.5 mg/ ml oral solution.
Azomyr is used to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergy, for example, hay fever or allergy to dust mites) or urticaria (a skin condition caused by an allergy, with symptoms including itching and hives).
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over): one dose of Azomyr oral lyophilisate placed in the mouth once a day for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over): two 2.5 mg Azomyr orodispersible tablets placed in the mouth once a day for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).
The prevalence of this poor metaboliser phenotype was comparable for adult (6%) and paediatric subjects 2- to 11-year old (6%), and greater among Blacks (18% adult, 16% paediatric) than Caucasians (2% adult, 3% paediatric) in both populations however the safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general population.
Azomyr 2.5 mg tablets has not been evaluated in paediatric patients however in conjunction with the dose finding studies in paediatrics, the pharmacokinetics data for Azomyr orodispersible tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose in paediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age.
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over): one 5 mg Azomyr orodispersible tablet placed in the mouth once a day for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).

There is one published case report on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. • Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and nicotine that use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly interact with memantine leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. • There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when memantine is co-administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. • In post-marketing experience isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin.
The most frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the Axura group than in the placebo group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%).
Adverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison to placebo at 6 months (observed cases analysis for the clinician´s interview based impression of change (CIBIC-plus): p=0.025; Alzheimer´s disease cooperative study – activities of daily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002).
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’ s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) from the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies with patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically significant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains.

Patients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.
During titration, multiple tablets may be used: up to four 100 micrograms or up to four 200 micrograms tablets may be used to treat a single episode of BTP during dose titration according to the following schedule: • If the initial 100 micrograms tablet is not efficacious, the patient can be instructed to treat the next episode of BTP with two 100 micrograms tablets.
If this dose is considered to be the effective dose, treatment of successive episodes of BTP may be continued with a single 200 micrograms tablet of Effentora. • If a single 200 micrograms tablet of Effentora (or two 100 micrograms tablets) is not considered to be efficacious the patient can be instructed to use two 200 micrograms tablets (or four 100 micrograms tablets) to treat the next episode of BTP.
The concomitant use of Effentora with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depression.
The adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly-related to treatment from clinical studies were as follows (frequencies defined as: very common ≥ 1/ 10, common ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10, uncommon ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100; within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness):
Mouth ulceration Oral hypoaesthesia Oral discomfort Oral mucosal blistering Oral mucosal discolouration Oral soft tissue disorder Glossodynia Tongue blistering Gingival pain Stomach discomfort Tongue ulceration Tongue disorder Dyspepsia Abdominal pain Oesophagitis Gastrooesophagal reflux disease Chapped lips Dry lip Tooth disorder Toothache
Immediate management of opioid overdose includes removal of the Effentora buccal tablet, if still in the mouth, ensuring a patent airway, physical and verbal stimulation of the patient, assessment of the level of consciousness, ventilatory and circulatory status, and assisted ventilation (ventilatory support) if necessary.

Renal impairment In clinical studies Riprazo has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol/ l or 1.70 mg/ dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol/ l or 2.00 mg/ dl in men and/ or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/ min), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension.
The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials.
Potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics Based on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other substances that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin) may lead to
The adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
6 Hypertension In hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Riprazo at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg provided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose.
In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the addition of Riprazo 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren 150 mg/ amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%).
In a 6-month study of 599 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nephropathy, all of whom were receiving losartan 100 mg and optimised antihypertensive background therapy, addition of Riprazo 300 mg achieved a 20% reduction versus placebo in urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR), i. e. from 58 mg/ mmol to 46 mg/ mmol.
Although aliskiren has known irritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy volunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold based on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/ kg/ day in the rat carcinogenicity study.
Renal impairment In clinical studies Riprazo has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol/ l or 1.70 mg/ dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol/ l or 2.00 mg/ dl in men and/ or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/ min), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension.

Patients who presented with cardiac events within 12 months prior to SUTENT administration, such as myocardial infarction (including severe/ unstable angina), coronary/ peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies.
The results of this study demonstrated that sunitinib had an effect on QTc (defined as a mean placebo-adjusted change of > 10 msec with a 90% CI upper limit > 15 msec) at therapeutic concentration (day 3) using the within-day baseline correction method, and at greater than therapeutic concentration (Day 9) using both baseline correction methods.
Using comprehensive serial ECG assessments at times corresponding to either therapeutic or greater than therapeutic exposures, none of the patients in the evaluable or ITT populations were observed to develop QTc prolongation considered as “ severe” (i. e. equal to or greater than Grade 3 by CTCAE version 3.0).
Concomitant administration of sunitinib malate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 49% and 51% increase of the complex [sunitinib + primary metabolite] Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of sunitinib malate in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with potent inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e. g. ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase sunitinib concentrations Combination with inhibitors should therefore be avoided, or the selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.
Fatal events other than those listed in section 4.4 above or section 4.8 below that were considered possibly related to SUTENT included multi-system organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, peritonoeal haemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, cerebrovascular accident, dehydration, adrenal insufficiency, renal failure, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, shock, and sudden death.

Sunitinib was identified as inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET).
CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical safety and efficacy of SUTENT has been studied in the treatment of patients with malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who were resistant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced disease progression during or following treatment with imatinib) or intolerant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced significant toxicity during treatment with imatinib that precluded further treatment) and the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) Efficacy is based on time to tumour progression and an increase in survival in GIST and on progression free survival and objective response rates for treatment-naïve and cytokine-refractory MRCC respectively.
Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized 1:1 to the treatment arms; they received treatment with either sunitinib in repeated 6-week cycles, consisting of 4 weeks of 50 mg daily oral administration followed by 2 weeks of rest (Schedule 4/ 2), or IFN-α, administered as a subcutaneous injection of 3 million units (MU) the first week, 6 MU the second week, and 9 MU the third week and thereafter on 3 non-consecutive days each week.
Metabolism The calculated in vitro Ki values for all CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/ 5 AND CYP4A9/ 11) indicated that sunitinib and its

In the studies comparing the effectiveness of the combination in patients who were already taking either amlodipine or valsartan, the blood pressure in patients taking valsartan alone had fallen by 6.6 mmHg after eight weeks, compared with 9.6 and 11.4 mmHg in the patients adding 5 or 10 mg amlodipine, respectively.
The most common side effects with Exforge (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat), influenza (flu), various types of oedema (swelling), fatigue (tiredness), flushing (reddening), asthenia (weakness) and hot flushes.
In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
Alopecia, altered bowel habits, dyspepsia, dyspnoea, rhinitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia, gynaecomastia, hyperglycaemia, impotence, increased urinary frequency, leucopenia, malaise, mood changes, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, angioedema and erythema multiforme.
Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
9 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Exforge regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7– 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
11 In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.

In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.

Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
21 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Exforge regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.

Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the risk being higher in low purity preparations, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed infrequently in patients treated with factor IX containing products.
As with all medicinal products derived from human blood, the use of Nonafact can cause allergic reactions which may include swelling of the larynx, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, hives, itching and rash, headache, tiredness, nausea, restlessness, fast heart beat, chest tightness, tingling, vomiting, wheezing.

The most common side effects with Osigraft (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are erythema (redness), tenderness, swelling over the implant site, and heterotopic ossification (development of bone in abnormal areas) or myositis ossificans (abnormal bone growth in the muscle).
Osigraft should also not be used by the following groups of patients: • skeletally immature (still growing), • with an autoimmune disease (where the immune system attacks parts of the body), • with an active infection at the surgery site or another serious infection, • without enough skin or blood supply at the fracture site, • where the fracture is disease-related (such as metabolic bone disease or cancer), • with have a tumour near the fracture, • receiving chemotherapy, radiation treatment or immunosuppression.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Osigraft’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of nonunion of tibia of at least nine month duration, secondary to trauma, in skeletally mature patients, where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible.
Osigraft is used in the treatment of nonunion (fractures which have failed to heal) of tibia of at least 9 month duration, secondary to trauma (following injury), in skeletally mature patients, in cases where previous treatment with autograft (transplanted bone from your hip) has failed or use of autograft is not feasible.
Adverse events following such surgery and not specifically associated with the product may include wound infection, osteomyelitis (infection of the bone), complications of mechanical support (such as the metal rod or plate used for stabilisation), bleeding at the wound site, failure of the wound to heal, nausea, fever and pain.
However, there were no differences in the incidence of these adverse events compared with patients who received bone autograft (transplanted bone) instead of Osigraft, except in the case of osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) for which the incidence of osteomyelitis was statistically higher in the autograft group.
In clinical studies, the following undesirable effects have been reported as related to Osigraft discoloration of the wound site, erythema (redness of the skin), tenderness, and swelling over the implant site, and heterotopic ossification / myositis ossificans (bone formation outside of the fracture area).

The most common side effects when taking Kivexa (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are hypersensitivity (allergic reactions), rash, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal (tummy) pain, headache, arthralgia (joint pain), muscle disorders, cough, nasal symptoms, fever, lethargy, fatigue (tiredness), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), malaise (feeling unwell), anorexia (loss of appetite) and alopecia (hair loss).
Symptoms almost always include fever or rash, but also very commonly include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), cough, lethargy, malaise, headache, signs of liver damage in the blood and myalgia (muscle pain).
As with all other NRTIs, Kivexa may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Kivexa during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
In populations similar to that enrolled in the PREDICT-1 study, it is estimated that 48% to 61% of patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele will develop a hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 0% to 4% of patients who do not have the HLA-B*5701 allele.
Other signs and symptoms may include respiratory signs and symptoms such as dyspnoea, sore throat, cough, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localised), gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain, and may lead to misdiagnosis of hypersensitivity as respiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis), or gastroenteritis.
To avoid a delay in diagnosis and minimise the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, Kivexa must be permanently discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (respiratory diseases, flu-like illness, gastroenteritis or reactions to other medicinal products).
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
To avoid a delay in diagnosis and minimise the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, abacavir must be permanently discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (respiratory diseases, flu-like illness, gastroenteritis or reactions to other medicinal products).
Hypersensitivity reactions with rapid onset, including life-threatening reactions have occurred after restarting abacavir in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity (skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and malaise) prior to stopping abacavir.
In a meta-analysis of five clinical trials where ABC was added to intensify therapy, of 166 subjects, 123 (74%) had M184V/ I, 50 (30%) had T215Y/ F, 45 (27%) had M41L, 30 (18%) had K70R and 25 (15%) had D67N.
Logistic regression modelling of the predictive value for genotype (adjusted for baseline plasma HIV-1RNA [vRNA], CD4+ cell count, number and duration of prior antiretroviral therapies) showed that the presence of 3 or more NRTI resistance-associated mutations was associated with reduced response at Week 4 (p=0.015) or 4 or more mutations at median Week 24 (p≤ 0.012).
Therapy-experienced patients In study CAL30001, 182 treatment-experienced patients with virologic failure were randomised and received treatment with either Kivexa once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily, both in combination with tenofovir and a PI or an NNRTI for 48 weeks.
Results indicate that the Kivexa group was non-inferior to the abacavir twice daily group, based on similar reductions in HIV-1 RNA as measured by average area under the curve minus baseline (AAUCMB, - 1.65 log10 copies/ ml versus -1.83 log10 copies/ ml respectively, 95% CI -0.13, 0.38).
In study ESS30008, 260 patients with virologic suppression on a first line therapy regimen containing abacavir 300 mg plus lamivudine 150 mg, both given twice daily and a PI or NNRTI, were randomised to continue this regimen or switch to Kivexa plus a PI or NNRTI for 48 weeks.
14 indicate that the Kivexa group was associated with a similar virologic outcome (non-inferior) compared to the abacavir plus lamivudine group, based on proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ ml (90% and 85% respectively, 95% CI -2.7, 13.5).
In a study of 20 HIV-infected patients receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily, with only one 300 mg dose taken prior to the 24 hour sampling period, the geometric mean terminal carbovir-TP intracellular half-life at steady-state was 20.6 hours, compared to the geometric mean abacavir plasma half-life in this study of 2.6 hours.
In a crossover study in 60 healthy volunteers, intracellular lamivudine-TP pharmacokinetic parameters were similar (AUC24, ss and Cmax24, ss) or lower (Ctrough – 24%) for the lamivudine 300 mg once daily regimen compared to the lamivudine 150 mg twice daily regimen.
Kivexa should not be taken with zalcitabine (used to treat HIV), high doses of co-trimoxazole (for infections caused by Pneumocystis carinii), injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet (used to treat infections caused by cytomegalo virus).
What Kivexa contains − The active substances are 600 mg of abacavir (as sulfate) and 300 mg of lamivudine. − The other ingredients are magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycollate, Opadry Orange YS-1-13065-A containing hypromellose, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 400, polysorbate 80 and sunset yellow aluminium lake (E110).

As with all other NRTIs, Viread may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Viread during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
The demonstration of benefit of Viread in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one study in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ ml) and studies in which Viread was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral pre-treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ ml, with the majority of patients having < 5,000 copies/ ml).
Administration of 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) every 48 hours is recommended based on modelling of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in non-HIV and non-HBV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis, but has not been confirmed in clinical studies.
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/ dl (0.48 mmol/ l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/ min in any patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).
Use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product (e. g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2).
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway, including the transport proteins human organic anion transporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e. g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product).
In HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve patients, small decreases in bone mineral density of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport proteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e. g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/ or the co-administered medicinal products.
Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and protease inhibitors and antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors are listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “ b. i. d.”, and once daily as “ q. d.”).
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was co-administered with emtricitabine, lamivudine, indinavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, saquinavir (ritonavir boosted), methadone, ribavirin, rifampicin, tacrolimus, or the hormonal contraceptive norgestimate/ ethinyl oestradiol.
Assessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on experience in two studies in 653 treatment-experienced patients receiving treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 443) or placebo (n = 210) in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for 24 weeks and also in a double-blind comparative controlled study in which 600 treatment-naïve patients received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) (n = 299) or stavudine (n = 301) in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks.
In a 144-week controlled clinical study in antiretroviral-naïve patients that compared tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz, patients who received tenofovir disoproxil had a significantly lower incidence of lipodystrophy compared with patients who received stavudine.
Assessment of adverse reactions from clinical study data is based on experience in two double-blind comparative controlled studies in which 641 patients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) daily (n = 426) or adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily (n = 215) for 48 weeks.
In studies with nucleoside-naïve patients, on-treatment ALT elevations > 10 times ULN (upper limit of normal) and > 2 times baseline occurred in 2.6% of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated patients versus 1.9% of adefovir dipivoxil-treated patients.
Among tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated patients, on-treatment ALT elevations had a median time to onset of 8 weeks, resolved with continued treatment, and, in a majority of cases, were associated with a ≥ 2 log10 copies/ ml reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation.
The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures), hypokalaemia, muscular weakness, myopathy and hypophosphataemia.
At week 24 the time-weighted average change from baseline in log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (DAVG24) was -0.03 log10 copies/ ml and -0.61 log10 copies/ ml for the placebo and tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) recipients (p < 0.0001).
A statistically significant difference in favour of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) was seen in the time-weighted average change from baseline at week 24 (DAVG24) for CD4 count (+13 cells/ mm3 for tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) versus -11 cells/ mm3 for placebo, p-value = 0.0008).
The 144-week, double-blind, active controlled phase of study GS-99-903 evaluated the efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) versus stavudine when used in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in HIV-1 infected patients naïve to antiretroviral therapy.
By intent to treat analysis (Missing data and switch in antiretroviral therapy (ART) considered as failure), the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies/ ml and 50 copies/ ml at 48 weeks of treatment was 80% and 76% respectively in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) arm, compared to 84% and 80% in the stavudine arm.
The average change from baseline for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 count at 48 weeks of treatment was similar in both treatment groups (-3.09 and -3.09 log10 copies/ ml; +169 and 167 cells/ mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) and stavudine groups, respectively).
At 144 weeks of treatment, the average change from baseline remained similar in both treatment groups (-3.07 and -3.03 log10 copies/ ml; +263 and +283 cells/ mm3 in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) and stavudine groups, respectively).
In both of these studies tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was significantly superior to adefovir dipivoxil for the primary efficacy endpoint of complete response (defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis).
* p-value versus adefovir dipivoxil < 0.05, a Complete response defined as HBV DNA levels < 400 copies/ ml and Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis, b Knodell necroinflammatory score improvement of at least 2 points without worsening in Knodell fibrosis, c Median change from baseline HBV DNA merely reflects the difference between baseline HBV DNA and the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay, d The population used for analysis of ALT normalisation included only patients with ALT above ULN at baseline.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with significantly greater proportions of patients with undetectable HBV DNA (< 169 copies/ ml [< 29 IU/ ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas Taqman HBV assay), when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (study GS-US-174-0102; 91%, 56% and study GS-US-174-0103; 69%, 9%), respectively.
Response to treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was comparable in nucleoside-experienced (n = 51) and nucleoside-naïve (n = 375) patients and in patients with normal ALT (n = 21) and abnormal ALT (n = 405) at baseline when studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were combined.
In a randomised, 48-week double-blind, controlled study of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis B with prior lamivudine experience (study ACTG 5127), the mean serum HBV DNA levels at baseline in patients randomised to the tenofovir
The efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) plus 200 mg emtricitabine is being evaluated in a randomised, double-blind study (study GS-US-174-0106), in HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients who had persistent viraemia (HBV DNA ≥ 1,000 copies/ ml) while receiving adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg for more than 24 weeks.
Overall at week 24, treatment with a tenofovir-containing regimen resulted in 77% (46/ 60) of patients with HBV DNA < 400 copies/ ml (< 69 IU/ ml) and 62% (37/ 60) of patients with undetectable HBV DNA (below 169 copies/ ml [< 29 IU/ ml]; the limit of quantification of the Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV assay).
Administration of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a meal to HIV infected patients resulted in mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax, AUC0-∞, and Cmin values of 326 (36.6%) ng/ ml, 3,324 (41.2%) ng·h/ ml and 64.4 (39.4%) ng/ ml, respectively.
Moreover, at concentrations substantially higher (approximately 300-fold) than those observed in vivo, tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, or CYP1A1/ 2).
Renal impairment Pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV, non-HBV infected patients with varying degrees of renal impairment defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal function when CrCl > 80 ml/ min; mild with CrCl = 50-79 ml/ min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 ml/ min and severe with CrCl = 10-29 ml/ min).
Compared with patients with normal renal function, the mean (%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 (12%) ng·h/ ml in subjects with CrCl > 80 ml/ min to respectively 3,064 (30%) ng·h/ ml, 6,009 (42%) ng·h/ ml and 15,985 (45%) ng·h/ ml in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment.
In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl < 10 ml/ min) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis tenofovir concentrations substantially increased over 48 hours achieving a mean Cmax of 1,032 ng/ ml and a mean AUC0-48h of 42,857 ng·h/ ml.
The mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 223 (34.8%) ng/ ml and 2,050 (50.8%) ng·h/ ml, respectively, in normal subjects compared with 289 (46.0%) ng/ ml and 2,310 (43.5%) ng·h/ ml in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and 305 (24.8%) ng/ ml and 2,740 (44.0%) ng·h/ ml in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.
Intracellular pharmacokinetics In non-proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the half-life of tenofovir diphosphate was found to be approximately 50 hours, whereas the half-life in phytohaemagglutinin- stimulated PBMCs was found to be approximately 10 hours.

Dexrazoxane undergoes intracellular hydrolysis first to its two one-ring open intermediates (B and C) and then to the two-ring opened form (ADR-925) which has a structure similar to EDTA and is a strong chelator of iron and divalent cations as calcium ions.
The carcinogenic potential of dexrazoxane has not been investigated, however, razoxane, (the racemic mixture of dexrazoxane and levrazoxane), has been reported to be associated with the development of secondary malignancies in mice (lymphoid neoplasms) and rats (uterine carcinomas) after administration for a prolonged period of time.
When mice with experimental daunorubicin extravasation were treated with dexrazoxane systemically combined with topical treatment with DMSO on the daunorubicin-affected skin area, 67% of the mice developed small skin wounds, whereas dexrazoxane treatment alone completely prevented the daunorubicin induced skin necrosis in another group of mice, Thus, DMSO should not be used in patients treated with dexrazoxane to prevent anthracycline extravasation.

In a clinical curative trial involving 175 preterm newborn infants less than 35 weeks of gestational age, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks post-conceptional age was 13/ 81 (16%) for indomethacin versus 23/ 94 (24%) for ibuprofen.
In a dose-response study of Pedea in 40 preterm newborn infants, the ductus arteriosus closure rate associated to the 10-5-5 mg/ kg dose regimen was 75% (6/ 8) in neonates of 27-29 weeks’ gestation and 33% (2/ 6) in neonates of 24-26 weeks ’ gestation.
Prophylactic use of Pedea in the first 3 days of life (starting within 6 hours of birth) in preterm newborn infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age was associated with increased incidence of renal failure and pulmonary adverse events including hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary haemorrhage, as compared to curative use.
In order to avoid any substantial variation of pH due to the presence of acidic medicinal products that could remain in the infusion line, the latter must be rinsed before and after administration of Pedea with 1.5 to 2 ml of either sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution.

The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) accepted that the data presented by the Company show that Pedea is effective in treating patent ductus arteriosus, and decided that Pedea’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm (less that 34 weeks gestational age) newborn infants.
Administration in combination with Paclitaxel or docetaxel In the pivotal trials, paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following the first dose of Herceptin (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for paclitaxel or docetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of Herceptin if the preceding dose of Herceptin was well tolerated.
In the adjuvant setting, Herceptin has also been investigated as a weekly regimen (an initial loading dose of 4 mg/ kg followed by 2 mg/ kg every week for one year) concomitantly with paclitaxel (administered weekly (80 mg/ m2) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/ m2) for a total of 12 weeks) following 4 cycles of AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/ m2 IV push concurrently with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/ m2 over 20– 30 minutes).
Infusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity Serious adverse reactions to Herceptin infusion that have been reported infrequently include dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, bronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory distress, urticaria and angioedema (see 4.8).
In EBC, the following patients were excluded from the HERA trial, there are no data about the benefit: risk balance, and therefore treatment can not be recommended in such patients: • History of documented CHF • High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias • Angina pectoris requiring medication • Clinically significant valvular disease • Evidence of transmural infarction on ECG • Poorly controlled hypertension

The test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal Herceptin monotherapy and Herceptin plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed immunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine monoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5.
Volume (ml) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/ kg for loading or 2 mg/ kg for maintenance) 21 (mg/ ml, concentration of reconstituted solution) • based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of 6 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight:
Herceptin is prescribed by doctors for the treatment of patients with early breast cancer, where it is used after you have finished your chemotherapy, and for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer (i. e., breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) who have tumours that produce large amounts of HER2.
Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing difficulties, wheezing, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired.
Other common side effects of Herceptin, occurring in less than 10 out of 100 patients, are: allergic reactions, abnormal blood counts (anaemia, low platelet count and low white blood count), constipation, heartburn (dyspepsia), infections, including bladder and skin infections, shingles, inflammation of the breast, inflammation of the pancreas or liver, kidney disorders, increased muscle tone / tension (hypertonia), tremor, numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes, nail disorders, hair loss, inability to sleep (insomnia), sleepiness (somnolence), nose bleeds, acne, itchiness, dry mouth
34 and skin, dry or watery eyes, sweating, feeling weak and unwell, anxiety, depression, abnormal thinking, dizziness, loss of appetite, weight loss, altered taste, asthma, lung disorders, back pain, neck pain, bone pain, leg cramps, haemorrhoids (piles), bruises and arthritis.
In metastatic breast cancer, Herceptin can be used in the following ways: • on its own in patients who have failed on at least two previous treatments; • in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel (other anticancer medicines); • in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (another type of anticancer medicine), in women who have been through the menopause and whose cancer also expresses receptors for hormones such as oestrogen or progesterone on its surface.
Four additional studies looked at the response to Herceptin given once every three weeks, either on its own (two studies in a total of 177 patients), in combination with paclitaxel (in 32 patients) or in combination with docetaxel, with or without capecitabine (another anticancer medicine) in 225 patients.
The most common side effects with Herceptin (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are abdominal (tummy) pain, asthenia (weakness), chest pain, chills, fever, headache, pain, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain) and skin rashes.

In one clinical study, baseline white cell cystine levels were 3.73 (range 0.13 to 19.8) nmol hemicystine/ mg protein and were maintained close to 1 nmol hemicystine/ mg protein with a cysteamine dose range of 1.3 to 1.95 g/ m2/ day.
An earlier study treated 94 children with nephropathic cystinosis with increasing doses of cysteamine to attain white cell cystine levels of less than 2 nmol hemicystine/ mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose, and compared their outcome with an historical control group of 17 children treated with placebo.
Following a single oral dose of cysteamine bitartrate equivalent to 1.05 g of cysteamine free base in healthy volunteers, the mean (± sd) values for the time to peak and peak plasma concentration are 1.4 (± 0.5) hours and 4.0 (± 1.0) µg/ ml, respectively.
Genotoxicity studies have been performed: although in published studies using cysteamine, induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured eukaryotic cell lines has been reported, specific studies with cysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in the mouse micronucleus test.

Caelyx may be used as first-line systemic chemotherapy, or as second line chemotherapy in AIDS-KS patients with disease that has progressed with, or in patients intolerant to, prior combination systemic chemotherapy comprising at least two of the following agents: a vinca alkaloid, bleomycin and standard doxorubicin (or other anthracycline).
The tables for PPE (Table 1) and stomatitis (Table 2) provide the schedule followed for dose modification in clinical trials in the treatment of breast or ovarian cancer (modification of the recommended 4 week treatment cycle): if these toxicities occur in patients with AIDS related KS, the recommended 2 to 3 week treatment cycle can be modified in a similar manner.
Caelyx pharmacokinetics determined in a small number of patients with elevated total bilirubin levels do not differ from patients with normal total bilirubin; however, until further experience is gained, the Caelyx dosage in patients with impaired hepatic function should be reduced based on the experience from the breast and ovarian clinical trial programs as follows: at initiation of therapy, if the bilirubin is between 1.2 - 3.0 mg/ dl, the first dose is reduced by 25%.
If the patient tolerates the first dose without an increase in serum bilirubin or liver enzymes, the dose for cycle 2 can be increased to the next dose level, i. e., if reduced by 25% for the first dose, increase to full dose for cycle 2; if reduced by 50% for the first dose, increase to 75% of full dose for cycle 2.
Whenever cardiomyopathy is suspected, i. e., the left ventricular ejection fraction has substantially decreased relative to pre-treatment values and/ or left ventricular ejection fraction is lower than a prognostically relevant value (e. g. < 45%), endomyocardial biopsy may be considered and the benefit of continued therapy must be carefully evaluated against the risk of developing irreversible cardiac damage.
Serious and sometimes life-threatening infusion reactions, which are characterised by allergic-like or anaphylactoid-like reactions, with symptoms including asthma, flushing, urticarial rash, chest pain, fever, hypertension, tachycardia, pruritus, sweating, shortness of breath, facial oedema, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest and throat and/ or hypotension may occur within minutes of starting the infusion of Caelyx.
Other strategies to prevent and treat PPE, which may be initiated for 4 to 7 days after treatment with Caelyx include keeping hands and feet cool, by exposing them to cool water (soaks, baths, or swimming), avoiding excessive heat/ hot water and keeping them unrestricted (no socks, gloves, or shoes that are tight fitting).
9 (medicine-related treatment-emergent) adverse events in combination therapy (Caelyx + bortezomib) were nausea (40%), diarrhoea (35%), neutropaenia (33%), thrombocytopaenia (29%), vomiting (28%), fatigue (27%), and constipation (22%).
509 patients with advanced breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were treated with Caelyx (n=254) at a dose of 50 mg/ m2 every 4 weeks, or doxorubicin (n=255) at a dose of 60 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks, in a phase III clinical trial (I97- 328).
Table 6 Treatment Related Undesirable Effects Reported in Ovarian Cancer Clinical Trials (50 mg/ m2 every 4 weeks) (Caelyx-treated patients) by Severity, MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term Very Common (≥ 1/ 10); Common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100) CIOMS III
Solid tumour patients: in a larger cohort of 929 patients with solid tumours (including breast cancer and ovarian cancer) predominantly treated at a dose of 50 mg/ m2 every 4 weeks, the safety profile and incidence of adverse effects are comparable to those of the patients treated in the pivotal breast cancer and ovarian cancer trials.
Of 646 patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy, 318 patients were treated with combination therapy of Caelyx 30 mg/ m2 as a one hour intravenous infusion administered on day 4 following bortezomib which is administered at 1.3 mg/ m² on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, every three weeks or with bortezomib monotherapy in a phase III clinical trial.
Treatment Related Undesirable Effects Reported in Multiple Myeloma Clinical Trial (Caelyx 30 mg/ m2 in combination with bortezomib every 3 weeks) by Severity, MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term Very Common (≥ 1/ 10); Common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100) CIOMS III AE by body system
100 out of 929 patients (10.8%) with solid tumours were described as having an infusion-associated reaction during treatment with Caelyx as defined by the following Costart terms: allergic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, asthma, face oedema, hypotension, vasodilatation, urticaria, back pain, chest pain, chills, fever, hypertension, tachycardia, dyspepsia, nausea, dizziness, dyspnoea, pharyngitis, rash, pruritus, sweating, injection site reaction and medicinal product interaction.
In the pivotal phase III trial versus doxorubicin, 58/ 509 (11.4%) randomized subjects (10 treated with Caelyx at a dose of 50 mg/ m2/ every 4 weeks versus 48 treated with doxorubicin at a dose of 60 mg/ m2/ every 3 weeks) met the protocol-defined criteria for cardiac toxicity during treatment and/ or follow-up.
Of the 418 patients treated with Caelyx 50 mg/ m2/ cycle, and having a baseline measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and at least one follow-up measurement assessed by MUGA scan, 88 patients had a cumulative anthracycline dose of > 400 mg/ m2, an exposure level associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity with conventional doxorubicin.
A phase III randomized, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre study comparing the safety and efficacy of Caelyx plus bortezomib combination therapy with bortezomib monotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who did not progress while receiving anthracycline-based therapy, was conducted in 646 patients.
There was a significant improvement in the primary endpoint of time to progression (TTP) for patients treated with combination therapy of Caelyx plus bortezomib compared to patients treated with bortezomib monotherapy as indicated by a risk reduction (RR) of 35% (95% CI; 21-47%), p < 0.0001, based on 407 TTP events.
The mean intrinsic clearance of Caelyx was 0.030 l/ h/ m2 (range 0.008 to 0.152 l/ h/ m2) and the mean central volume of distribution was 1.93 l/ m2 (range 0.96 – 3.85 l/ m2) approximating the plasma volume.
Decreased testicular weights and hypospermia were present in rats after repeat doses ≥ 0.25 mg/ kg/ day and diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and a marked decrease in spermatogenesis were observed in dogs after repeat doses of 1 mg/ kg/ day (see section 4.6).

If you are being treated for multiple myeloma, and have already received at least 1 prior therapy, Caelyx will be administered at a dose of 30 mg per square metre of your body surface area (based on your height and weight) as a 1 hour intravenous infusion on Day 4 of the bortezomib 3 week regimen immediately after the bortezomib infusion.
38 During the infusion of Caelyx, the following reactions may occur: flushing of the face, shortness of breath, headache, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest and/ or throat, sore throat, low or increase in blood pressure, rapid heart beat, puffing of the face, fever, dizziness, nausea, indigestion, itching, rash and sweating.
Caelyx is used on its own for this disease; • advanced ovarian cancer (cancer of the ovary) in women whose previous treatment including a platinum-based anticancer medicine has stopped working; • Kaposi’ s sarcoma (a cancer of the blood vessels) in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who have very damaged immune systems and extensive sarcoma on the skin, the moist body surfaces or the internal organs.
For Kaposi’ s sarcoma, the dose is 20 mg/ m2 every two to three weeks for two to three months, and for multiple myeloma, it is 30 mg/ m2 on day four of each three-week cycle of bortezomib treatment, for as long as the patient continues to benefit from the treatment and can tolerate it.
Other very common side effects include palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (redness and pain on the hands and feet), vomiting, stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth), rash, asthenia (weakness), low blood cell counts, anorexia (loss of appetite), alopecia (hair loss), fatigue (tiredness), diarrhoea, constipation and mucositis (inflammation of the mouth and throat).
At the start of the study, the patients’ viral loads were around 88,100 copies/ ml, but after 48 weeks, 78% of the patients taking Reyataz (343 out of 440) had viral loads below 50 copies/ ml, compared with 76% of those taking lopinavir (338 out of 443).
The most common side effects with Reyataz (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, ocular icterus (yellowing of the eyes), vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal (tummy) pain, nausea (feeling sick), dyspepsia (heartburn), rash, lipodystrophy syndrome (changes in the distribution of body fat), fatigue (tiredness) and jaundice (yellowing of the skin).
Reyataz must not be used in patients taking any of the following medicines: • rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis); • St John’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression); • medicines that are broken down in the same way as Reyataz or ritonavir and are harmful at high levels in the blood.
In antiretroviral treatment experienced patients, the demonstration of efficacy is based on a study comparing REYATAZ 300 mg once daily in combination with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with lopinavir/ ritonavir, each regimen in combination with tenofovir (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
REYATAZ with ritonavir must not be used in combination with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e. g., astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), and ergot alkaloids, particularly, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5).
Particular caution should be used when prescribing REYATAZ in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval and/ or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte imbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).
Osteonecrosis Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Concomitant use of REYATAZ/ ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
If the combination of REYATAZ with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded.
Therefore, REYATAZ with ritonavir is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index: astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section 4.3).
5 Other interactions Interactions between atazanavir/ ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors, and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “ BID” and once daily as “ QD”).
atazanavir, dosed ↔ 1.03 ↑ 1.12 ↔ 1.03 1 hr after ddI+d4T (0.64, 1.67) (0.67, 1.18) (0.61, 1.73) (fasted) Atazanavir concentrations were greatly decreased when co-administered with didanosine (buffered tablets) and stavudine.
(0.65, 0.94) (0.70, 1.00) (0.57-1.02) * In a combined analysis from several clinical studies, atazanavir/ ritonavir 300/ 100 mg co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (n=39) was compared to atazanavir/ ritonavir 300/ 100 mg (n=33).

Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolized via the P450 3A pathway, eg, budesonide.
REYATAZ has been evaluated for safety in combination therapy with other antiretroviral medicinal products in controlled clinical trials in 1,806 adult patients receiving REYATAZ 400 mg once daily (1,151 patients, 52 weeks median duration and 152 weeks maximum duration) or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (655 patients, 48 weeks median duration and 101 weeks maximum duration).
Among patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, the only adverse reactions of any severity reported very commonly with at least a possible relationship to regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs were nausea (20%), diarrhoea (10%), and jaundice (12%).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), or very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Other marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), elevated alanine aminotransferase/ serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/ SGPT) (4%), low neutrophils (4%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/ serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/ SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (2%).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/ or hepatitis C virus Among 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C.
Combinations of atazanavir with stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, zidovudine, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, did not result in antagonistic anti-HIV activity or enhanced cytotoxic effects at the highest concentrations used for antiviral evaluation.
Clinical results In antiretroviral naive patients Study 138 is an international randomised, open-label, multicenter, prospective trial of 883 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients comparing REYATAZ/ ritonavir (300 mg/ 100 mg once daily) to lopinavir/ ritonavir (400 mg/ 100 mg twice daily), each in combination with fixed dose tenofovir/ emtricitabine (300 mg/ 200 mg tablets once daily).
In a per protocol analysis which excluded non-completers (i. e. patients who discontinued before the week 48 HIV RNA assessment) and patients with major protocol deviations, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml at week 48 was 86% (338/ 392) for REYATAZ/ ritonavir and 89% (332/ 372) for lopinavir/ ritonavir (difference estimate of ATV/ RTV-LPV/ RTV: -3% [95% CI, -7.6%, 1.5%].
REYATAZ/ RTV with tenofovir/ emtricitabine (fixed dose 300 mg/ 200 mg tablets once daily). b Lopinavir/ RTV with tenofovir/ emtricitabine (fixed dose 300 mg/ 200 mg tablets once daily). c Intent-to-treat analysis, with missing values considered as failures. d Number of patients evaluable.
In antiretroviral experienced patients Study 045 is a randomised, multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ (300 mg once daily) with ritonavir (100 mg once daily) to REYATAZ (400 mg once daily) with saquinavir soft gelatine capsules (1,200 mg once daily), and to lopinavir + ritonavir (400/ 100 mg fixed dose combination twice daily), each in combination with tenofovir (see sections 4.5 and 4.8) and one NRTI, in 347 (of 358 randomised) patients with virologic failure on two or more prior regimens containing at least one PI, NRTI, and NNRTI.
Fifteen of 120 (13%) patients in the REYATAZ + ritonavir treatment arm and 17 of 123 (14%) patients in the lopinavir + ritonavir arm had four or more of the PI substitutions L10, M46, I54, V82, I84, and L90.
Mean HIV RNA changes from baseline at Week 96 (-2.29 log10 copies/ ml for REYATAZ + ritonavir and -2.08 log10 copies/ ml for lopinavir + ritonavir, time-averaged difference of 0.14, 97.5% confidence interval [-0.13, 0.41]) met criteria for non-inferiority based on observed cases.
In the analysis performed for patients with ≥ 4 protease gene mutations among the following set of mutations 10, 20, 24, 32, 33, 36, 46, 48, 50, 54, 63, 71, 73, 82, 84 and 90, the results significantly favoured the lopinavir + ritonavir arm.
Absorption: in HIV-infected patients (n=33, combined studies), multiple dosing of REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir, Cmax of 4466 (42%) ng/ ml, with time to Cmax of approximately 2.5 hours.
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were generally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and liver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic single-cell necrosis.
In antiretroviral treatment experienced patients, the demonstration of efficacy is based on a study comparing REYATAZ 300 mg once daily in combination with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with lopinavir/ ritonavir, each regimen in combination with tenofovir (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

REYATAZ with ritonavir must not be used in combination with medicinal products that are substrates of the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450 and have narrow therapeutic windows (e. g., astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), and ergot alkaloids, particularly, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine) (see section 4.5).
Particular caution should be used when prescribing REYATAZ in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval and/ or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte imbalances (see sections 4.8 and 5.3).
Osteonecrosis Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Concomitant use of REYATAZ/ ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
If the combination of REYATAZ with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded.
Therefore, REYATAZ with ritonavir is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index: astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section 4.3).
45 Other interactions Interactions between atazanavir/ ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors, and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice daily as “ BID” and once daily as “ QD”).

Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolized via the P450 3A pathway, eg, budesonide.
REYATAZ has been evaluated for safety in combination therapy with other antiretroviral medicinal products in controlled clinical trials in 1,806 adult patients receiving REYATAZ 400 mg once daily (1,151 patients, 52 weeks median duration and 152 weeks maximum duration) or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (655 patients, 48 weeks median duration and 101 weeks maximum duration).
Among patients who received REYATAZ 400 mg once daily or REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, the only adverse reactions of any severity reported very commonly with at least a possible relationship to regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs were nausea (20%), diarrhoea (10%), and jaundice (12%).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), or very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Other marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in ≥ 2% of patients receiving regimens containing REYATAZ and one or more NRTIs included: elevated creatine kinase (7%), elevated alanine aminotransferase/ serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/ SGPT) (4%), low neutrophils (4%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase/ serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/ SGOT) (3%), and elevated lipase (2%).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/ or hepatitis C virus Among 1,151 patients receiving atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 177 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C, and among 655 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, 97 patients were co-infected with chronic hepatitis B or C.
Combinations of atazanavir with stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, zidovudine, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, did not result in antagonistic anti-HIV activity or enhanced cytotoxic effects at the highest concentrations used for antiviral evaluation.
Clinical results In antiretroviral naive patients Study 138 is an international randomised, open-label, multicenter, prospective trial of 883 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients comparing REYATAZ/ ritonavir (300 mg/ 100 mg once daily) to lopinavir/ ritonavir (400 mg/ 100 mg twice daily), each in combination with fixed dose tenofovir/ emtricitabine (300 mg/ 200 mg tablets once daily).
In a per protocol analysis which excluded non-completers (i. e. patients who discontinued before the week 48 HIV RNA assessment) and patients with major protocol deviations, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml at week 48 was 86% (338/ 392) for REYATAZ/ ritonavir and 89% (332/ 372) for lopinavir/ ritonavir (difference estimate of ATV/ RTV-LPV/ RTV: -3% [95% CI, -7.6%, 1.5%].

In antiretroviral experienced patients Study 045 is a randomised, multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ (300 mg once daily) with ritonavir (100 mg once daily) to REYATAZ (400 mg once daily) with saquinavir soft gelatine capsules (1,200 mg once daily), and to lopinavir + ritonavir (400/ 100 mg fixed dose combination twice daily), each in combination with tenofovir (see sections 4.5 and 4.8) and one NRTI, in 347 (of 358 randomised) patients with virologic failure on two or more prior regimens containing at least one PI, NRTI, and NNRTI.
Fifteen of 120 (13%) patients in the REYATAZ + ritonavir treatment arm and 17 of 123 (14%) patients in the lopinavir + ritonavir arm had four or more of the PI substitutions L10, M46, I54, V82, I84, and L90.
Mean HIV RNA changes from baseline at Week 96 (-2.29 log10 copies/ ml for REYATAZ + ritonavir and -2.08 log10 copies/ ml for lopinavir + ritonavir, time-averaged difference of 0.14, 97.5% confidence interval [-0.13, 0.41]) met criteria for non-inferiority based on observed cases.
In the analysis performed for patients with ≥ 4 protease gene mutations among the following set of mutations 10, 20, 24, 32, 33, 36, 46, 48, 50, 54, 63, 71, 73, 82, 84 and 90, the results significantly favoured the lopinavir + ritonavir arm.
Absorption: in HIV-infected patients (n=33, combined studies), multiple dosing of REYATAZ 300 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food produced a geometric mean (CV%) for atazanavir, Cmax of 4466 (42%) ng/ ml, with time to Cmax of approximately 2.5 hours.
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, conducted in mice, rats, and dogs, atazanavir-related findings were generally confined to the liver and included generally minimal to mild increases in serum bilirubin and liver enzymes, hepatocellular vacuolation and hypertrophy, and, in female mice only, hepatic single-cell necrosis.

• The risk of opportunistic infections, in particular CMV viraemia • Recommendation to avoid vaccination with live vaccines for at least 12 months following MabCampath therapy • The risk of infusion reactions o Need for premedication o That treatment for hypersensitivity reactions, including measures for resuscitation should be available during administration o That the risk of infusion reactions is highest in first week of therapy o That if the reaction is moderate or severe dosing should continue at the same level (ie no dose escalation) until each dose is well tolerated o That if therapy is withheld for more than 7 days then MabCampath should be reinstituted with gradual dose escalation
However, if acute moderate to severe adverse reactions such as hypotension, rigors, fever, shortness of breath, chills, rashes and bronchospasm (some of which may be due to cytokine release) occur at either the 3 mg or 10 mg dose levels, then those doses should be repeated daily until they are well tolerated before further dose escalation is attempted (see section 4.4).
It is highly recommended that anti-infective prophylaxis (e. g. trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole 1 tablet twice daily, 3 times weekly, or other prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) and an effective oral anti-herpes agent, such as famciclovir, 250 mg twice daily) should be initiated while on therapy and for a minimum of 2 months following completion of treatment with MabCampath or until the CD4+ count has recovered to 200 cells/μ l or greater, whichever is the later.

Pramipexole Teva is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i. e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “ on off ” fluctuations).
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/ min, the initial daily dose of Pramipexole Teva should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/ 0.25 mg of salt daily).
Patients being treated with Pramipexole Teva and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
The following adverse reactions are expected under the use of Pramipexole Teva: abnormal dreams, confusion, constipation, delusion, dizziness, dyskinesia, fatigue, hallucinations, headache, hyperkinesia, hypotension, increased eating (binge eating, hyperphagia), insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, paranoia; pathological gambling, hypersexuality and other abnormal behaviour, somnolence, weight increase, sudden onset of sleep, pruritus and rash and other hypersensitivity.

Most hallucinations are visual.  You have dyskinesia (e. g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs) If you have advanced Parkinson’ s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the uptitration of Pramipexole Teva.  You have a mental illness such as schizophrenia or depression  You have heart problems (your doctor may decide to do check-ups more often during treatment to make sure that your blood pressure does not fall too low).
Talk to your doctor if you are taking any of the following:  Medicines which affect kidney function or are excreted by the kidneys, e. g. cimetidine (used to treat indigestion and other stomach problems) and amantidine (used to manage Parkinson’ s disease)  Levodopa (used to manage Parkinson’ s disease)  Medicines used to treat mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or depression  Other medicines which can cause drowsiness since the drowsiness may become worse in the combination with Pramipexole Teva.
Common:  Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there)  Confusion  Tiredness (fatigue)  Excess fluid, usually in the legs (peripheral oedema)  Headache  Abnormal dreams  Constipation  Sleeplessness (insomnia)
Uncommon:  Paranoia (e. g. excessive fear for one’ s own well-being)  Delusion  Excessive daytime sleepiness and falling asleep suddenly  Hyperkinesia (increased movements and inability to keep still)  Weight increase  Increased sexual desire drive (e. g. increased libido)  Allergic reactions (e. g. rash, itching, hypersensitivity)

Infanrix Penta contains small amounts of: • toxoids from the bacteria that cause diphtheria and tetanus; • toxoids and other proteins purified from B. pertussis; • surface antigen (proteins from the surface) of the hepatitis B virus; • inactivated polioviruses (types 1, 2 and 3).
Infanrix Penta is a combination of components that have been available in the European Union (EU) in other vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B were available in Infanrix HepB from 1997 until 2005, and diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polioviruses are available in other vaccines.
The most common side effects with Infanrix Penta (seen in more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) are loss of appetite, fever of 38ºC or more, local swelling, pain and redness at the injection site, fatigue (tiredness), abnormal crying, irritability and restlessness.
Infanrix Penta should not be used in infants who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to any of the active substances, to any of the other ingredients of the vaccine, or to neomycin and polymyxin (antibiotics), or if the infant has had an allergic reaction after a previous vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B or polio.
Very common: fever ≥ 38°C, local swelling at the injection site (≤ 50 mm), fatigue, pain, redness Common: fever > 39.5°C, local swelling at the injection site (> 50 mm)*, injection site reactions, including induration Uncommon: diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint*

Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. • if your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B or poliomyelitis diseases. • if your child experienced problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination with a vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) disease. • if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).
• if after previously having Infanrix Penta or another vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) disease, your child had any problems, especially: ♦ A high temperature (over 40°C) within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ A collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ Persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination ♦ Seizures/ fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination • if your child is suffering from an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or uncontrolled epilepsy.
After control of the disease the vaccine should be administered. • if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily • if your child has a tendency to seizures/ fits due to a fever, or if there is a history in the family of this As with all vaccines, Infanrix Penta may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated.
As with other vaccines against pertussis (whooping cough) disease, following side effects may occur very rarely within 2 to 3 days after vaccination: • collapse or periods of unconsciousness or lack of awareness • seizures or fits with or without fever If your child gets any of these side effects you should contact a doctor urgently.
These medicinal products include astemizole, terfenadine, oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), triazolam, cisapride, pimozide, amiodarone, ergot alkaloids (e. g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine) and vardenafil.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Concomitant use of Kaletra and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
Efavirenz: when used in combination with efavirenz and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in multiple protease inhibitor-experienced patients, increasing the dose of Kaletra 33.3% from 400/ 100 mg (3 capsules) twice daily to 533/ 133 mg (4 capsules) twice daily yielded similar lopinavir plasma concentrations as compared to historical data of Kaletra 400/ 100 mg (3 capsules) twice daily.
Co-administration of increased doses of fosamprenavir 1400 mg twice daily with lopinavir/ ritonavir 533/ 133 mg twice daily to protease inhibitor-experienced patients resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and elevations in triglycerides with the combination regimen without increases in virological efficacy,
Saquinavir 800 mg twice daily co-administered with Kaletra resulted in an increase of saquinavir AUC by approximately 30% relative to saquinavir/ ritonavir 1000/ 100 mg twice daily, and produces similar exposure to those reported after saquinavir/ ritonavir 400/ 400 mg twice daily.
8 Bupropion: in healthy volunteers, the AUC and Cmax of bupropion and of its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion, were decreased by about 50% when co-administered with lopinavir/ ritonavir capsules 400/ 100 mg twice daily at steady-state.
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors: phosphodiesterase inhibitors which are dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism, such as tadalafil and sildenafil, are expected to result in an approximately 2-fold and 11-fold increase in AUC respectively, when co-administered with ritonavir containing regimens including Kaletra and may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions including hypotension, synope, visual changes and prolonged erection.
10 Fluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily were co − administered with 50 μ g intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for seven days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 − 89%).
Abdomen enlarged, constipation, dry mouth, dysphagia, enterocolitis, eructation, oesophagitis, faecal incontinence, gastritis, gastroenteritis, haemorrhagic colitis, mouth ulcerations, pancreatitis2, sialadenitis, stomatitis, ulcerative stomatitis, periodontitis
Increased activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased haemoglobin, decreased platelets, increased sodium, increased potassium, increased calcium, increased bilirubin, increased SGPT/ ALT, increased SGOT/ AST, increased total cholesterol, increased amylase, increased uric acid, decreased sodium, decreased potassium, decreased calcium, decreased neutrophils
Overall, the in vitro characterisation of phenotypic cross-resistance between lopinavir and other protease inhibitors suggest that decreased susceptibility to lopinavir correlated closely with decreased susceptibility to ritonavir and indinavir, but did not correlate closely with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir.
In a Phase II study (M97-720) through 204 weeks of treatment, genotypic analysis of viral isolates was successfully conducted in 11 of 16 patients with confirmed HIV RNA above 400 copies/ ml revealed no primary or active site mutations in protease (amino acids at positions 8, 30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 82, 84 and 90) or protease inhibitor phenotypic resistance.
In a Phase III study (M98-863) of 653 patients randomised to receive stavudine plus lamivudine with either lopinavir/ ritonavir or nelfinavir, 113 nelfinavir-treated subjects and 74 lopinavir/ ritonavir- treated subjects had an HIV RNA above 400 copies/ ml while on treatment from Week 24 through Week 96.
The selection of resistance to lopinavir in patients having failed prior protease inhibitor therapy was characterised by analysing the longitudinal isolates from 19 protease inhibitor-experienced subjects in 2 Phase II and one Phase III studies who either experienced incomplete virologic suppression or viral rebound subsequent to initial response to Kaletra and who demonstrated incremental in vitro resistance between baseline and rebound (defined as emergence of new mutations or 2-fold change in phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir).
After 48 weeks of treatment with Kaletra, efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plasma HIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/ ml was observed in 93% (25/ 27), 73% (11/ 15), and 25% (2/ 8) of patients with< 10-fold, 10 to 40-fold, and > 40-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline, respectively.
Study M97-765 is a randomised, double-blind trial evaluating Kaletra at two dose levels (400/ 100 mg and 400/ 200 mg, both twice daily) plus nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 70 single protease inhibitor experienced, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor naïve patients.
By intent to treat analysis where patients with missing values are considered virologic failures, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 400 (< 50) copies/ ml at 24 weeks was 75% (58%) and the mean increase from baseline in CD4 cell count was 174 cells/ mm3 for the 36 patients receiving the 400/ 100 mg dose of Kaletra.
M98-957 is a randomised, open-label study evaluating Kaletra treatment at two dose levels (400/ 100 mg and 533/ 133 mg, both twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 57 multiple protease inhibitor experienced, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor naïve patients.
The lopinavir mean steady-state AUC, Cmax, and Cmin were 72.6 ± 31.1 μ g• h/ ml, 8.2 ± 2.9 μ g/ ml and 3.4 ± 2.1 μ g/ ml, respectively after Kaletra 230/ 57.5 mg/ m2 twice daily without nevirapine (n=12), and were 85.8 ± 36.9 μ g• h/ ml, 10.0 ± 3.3 μ g/ ml and 3.6 ± 3.5 μ g/ ml, respectively after 300/ 75 mg/ m2 twice daily with nevirapine (n=12).

Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Patients taking the oral solution, particularly those with renal impairment or with decreased ability to metabolise propylene glycol (e. g. those of Asian origin), should be monitored for adverse reactions potentially related to propylene glycol toxicity (i. e. seizures, stupor, tachycardia, hyperosmolarity, lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, haemolysis) (see section 4.3).
Concomitant use of Kaletra and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).

Saquinavir 800 mg twice daily co-administered with Kaletra resulted in an increase of saquinavir AUC by approximately 30% relative to saquinavir/ ritonavir 1000/ 100 mg twice daily, and produces similar exposure to those reported after saquinavir/ ritonavir 400/ 400 mg twice daily.

Oral solution contains: alcohol (42% v/ v), high fructose corn syrup, propylene glycol, purified water, glycerol, povidone, magnasweet-110 flavour (mixture of monoammonium glycyrrhizinate and glycerol), vanilla flavour (containing p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillic acid, vanillin, heliotrope, ethyl vanillin), polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil, cotton candy flavour (containing ethyl maltol, ethyl vanillin, acetoin, dihydrocoumarin, propylene glycol), acesulfame potassium, saccharin sodium, sodium chloride, peppermint oil, sodium citrate, citric acid, menthol.
These medicinal products include astemizole, terfenadine, oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), triazolam, cisapride, pimozide, amiodarone, ergot alkaloids (e. g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine) and vardenafil.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Concomitant use of Kaletra and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
Co-administration of increased doses of fosamprenavir 1400 mg twice daily with lopinavir/ ritonavir 533/ 133 mg twice daily to protease inhibitor-experienced patients resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and elevations in triglycerides with the combination regimen without increases in virological efficacy, when compared with standard doses of fosamprenavir/ ritonavir.
Saquinavir 800 mg twice daily co-administered with Kaletra resulted in an increase of saquinavir AUC by approximately 30% relative to saquinavir/ ritonavir 1000/ 100 mg twice daily, and produces similar exposure to those reported after saquinavir/ ritonavir 400/ 400 mg twice daily.
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors: phosphodiesterase inhibitors which are dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism, such as tadalafil and sildenafil, are expected to result in an approximately 2-fold and 11-fold increase in AUC respectively, when co-administered with ritonavir containing regimens including Kaletra and may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions including hypotension, synope, visual changes and prolonged erection.
Fluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily were co − administered with 50 μ g intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for seven days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 − 89%).
Abdomen enlarged, constipation, dry mouth, dysphagia, enterocolitis, eructation, oesophagitis, faecal incontinence, gastritis, gastroenteritis, haemorrhagic colitis, mouth ulcerations, pancreatitis2, sialadenitis, stomatitis, ulcerative stomatitis, periodontitis
Increased activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased haemoglobin, decreased platelets, increased sodium, increased potassium, increased calcium, increased bilirubin, increased SGPT/ ALT, increased SGOT/ AST, increased total cholesterol, increased amylase, increased uric acid, decreased sodium, decreased potassium, decreased calcium, decreased neutrophils
Overall, the in vitro characterisation of phenotypic cross-resistance between lopinavir and other protease inhibitors suggest that decreased susceptibility to lopinavir correlated closely with decreased susceptibility to ritonavir and indinavir, but did not correlate closely with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir.
In a Phase II study (M97-720) through 204 weeks of treatment, genotypic analysis of viral isolates was successfully conducted in 11 of 16 patients with confirmed HIV RNA above 400 copies/ ml revealed no primary or active site mutations in protease (amino acids at positions 8, 30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 82, 84 and 90) or protease inhibitor phenotypic resistance.
In a Phase III study (M98-863) of 653 patients randomised to receive stavudine plus lamivudine with either lopinavir/ ritonavir or nelfinavir, 113 nelfinavir-treated subjects and 74 lopinavir/ ritonavir- treated subjects had an HIV RNA above 400 copies/ ml while on treatment from Week 24 through Week 96.
The selection of resistance to lopinavir in patients having failed prior protease inhibitor therapy was characterised by analysing the longitudinal isolates from 19 protease inhibitor-experienced subjects in 2 Phase II and one Phase III studies who either experienced incomplete virologic suppression or viral rebound subsequent to initial response to Kaletra and who demonstrated incremental in vitro resistance between baseline and rebound (defined as emergence of new mutations or 2-fold change in phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir).
After 48 weeks of treatment with Kaletra, efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plasma HIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/ ml was observed in 93% (25/ 27), 73% (11/ 15), and 25% (2/ 8) of patients with< 10-fold, 10 to 40-fold, and > 40-fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline, respectively.
Study M97-765 is a randomised, double-blind trial evaluating Kaletra at two dose levels (400/ 100 mg and 400/ 200 mg, both twice daily) plus nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 70 single protease inhibitor experienced, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor naïve patients.
By intent to treat analysis where patients with missing values are considered virologic failures, the proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 400 (< 50) copies/ ml at 24 weeks was 75% (58%) and the mean increase from baseline in CD4 cell count was 174 cells/ mm3 for the 36 patients receiving the 400/ 100 mg dose of Kaletra.

Co-administration of increased doses of fosamprenavir 1400 mg twice daily with lopinavir/ ritonavir 533/ 133 mg twice daily to protease inhibitor-experienced patients resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and elevations in triglycerides with the combination regimen without increases in virological efficacy, when compared with standard doses of fosamprenavir/ ritonavir.
69 Saquinavir 800 mg twice daily co-administered with Kaletra resulted in an increase of saquinavir AUC by approximately 30% relative to saquinavir/ ritonavir 1000/ 100 mg twice daily, and produces similar exposure to those reported after saquinavir/ ritonavir 400/ 400 mg twice daily.

Do not take Kaletra with any of the following medicines: − Astemizole or terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may be available without prescription); − Midazolam taken orally (taken by mouth), triazolam (used to relieve anxiety and/or trouble sleeping); − Pimozide (used to treat schizophrenia); − Cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); − Ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to treat headaches); − Amiodarone (used to treat abnormal heart beat); − Vardenafil (used to treat erectile dysfunction); − Products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).
Tell your doctor if you have/had: − Haemophilia type A and B as Kaletra might increase the risk of bleeding. − Diabetes as increased blood sugars have been reported in patients receiving Kaletra. − A history of liver problems as patients with a history of liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B or C are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver side effects.
Tell your doctor if you experience: − Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and severe weakness of the muscles in the legs and arms as these symptoms may indicate raised lactic acid levels. − Thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision or weight loss as this may indicate raised sugar levels in the blood. − Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the blood) have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and these symptoms may suggest this condition. − Changes in body shape due to changes in fat distribution.
It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. − Joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement as some patients taking these medicines may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression (reduction in the activity of the immune system), higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. − Muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly in combination with these medicines.
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below, as special care should then be taken: − Antibiotics (e.g. rifabutin, rifampicin, clarithromycin); − Anticancer medicines (e.g. vincristine, vinblastine); − Antidepressants (e.g. trazodone, bupropion); − Anti-epilepsy medicines (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital); − Antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole); − Erectile dysfunction medicines (e.g. sildenafil and tadalafil);
− Medicines used to lower blood cholesterol (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin); − Medicines affecting the immune system (e.g. cyclosporin, sirolimus (rapamycin), tacrolimus); − Medicines used for smoking cessation (e.g. bupropion); − Morphine-like medicines (e.g. methadone); − Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (e.g. efavirenz, nevirapine); − Oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy (see section below titled Contraceptives); − Protease inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir); − Sedatives (e.g. midazolam administered by injection); − Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, ethinyl oestradiol); − Warfarin.
Erectile dysfunction medicines (vardenafil, sildenafil, tadalafil) − Do not take Kaletra if you are currently taking vardenafil. − If you take sildenafil or tadalafil and Kaletra together, you may be at risk of side effects such as low blood pressure, passing out, visual changes and penile erection lasting more than 4 hours.
− If you are currently using an oral contraceptive or using a patch contraceptive to prevent pregnancy, you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. condom) as Kaletra may reduce the effectiveness of oral and patch contraceptives. − Kaletra does not reduce the risk of passing HIV to others.
− Tell you doctor immediately if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding. − Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take Kaletra unless specifically directed by the doctor. − It is recommended that HIV-infected women do not breast-feed their infants because there is a possibility that the baby can be infected with HIV through your breast milk.
Your doctor will advise on the number of tablets to be taken. − For children, your doctor will decide the right dose (number of tablets) based on the child’s height and weight. − Kaletra is also supplied as an oral solution for patients who cannot take tablets and as 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets.
− Do not stop or change the daily dose of Kaletra without first consulting with your doctor. − Kaletra should always be taken twice every day to help control your HIV infection, no matter how much better you feel. − Using Kaletra as recommended should give you the best chance of delaying the development of resistance to the product. − If a side effect is preventing you from taking Kaletra as directed tell your doctor right away. − Always keep enough Kaletra on hand so you don’t run out.
Further information about increased cholesterol and triglycerides − The long-term risks for complications such as heart attacks or stroke due to increased triglycerides and cholesterol are not known at this time. − Your doctor will monitor you and may prescribe other medicines if needed. − Large increases in the amount of triglycerides (fats in the blood) have been considered a risk factor for pancreatitis.

Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version RMPv3 (dated 31 January 2008) of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
• if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of Prepandrix (these are listed at the end of this leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or sodium deoxycholate.
♦ Uncommon (these may occur with up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): • Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet • Dizziness • Sleepiness • Sleeplessness • Diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain, feeling sick • Itching, rash • Generally feeling unwell
♦ Rare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): • Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves • Fits • Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising • Allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to collapse, coma and death
The most common side effects with Prepandrix (occurred with 1 in 10 doses or more of the vaccine) are headache, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), reactions at the site of the injection (hardening, swelling, pain and redness), fever and fatigue (tiredness).
Prepandrix should not be given to people who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine, or to any of the substances found at trace (very low) levels in the vaccine, such as eggs, chicken protein, ovalbumin (a protein in egg white), formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (an antibiotic) and sodium deoxycholate.
Olanzapine Recommended Starting Dose of Maintenance Dose after 2 Months of ZYPADHERA ZYPADHERA Treatment 210 mg/ 2 weeks or 405 mg/ 4 weeks 150 mg/ 2 weeks or 300 mg/ 4 weeks 300 mg/ 2 weeks 210 mg/ 2 weeks or 405 mg/ 4 weeks 300 mg/ 2 weeks 300 mg/ 2 weeks
Due to the slow dissolution of the olanzapine pamoate salt which provides a slow continuous release of olanzapine that is complete approximately six to eight months after the last injection, supervision by a clinician, especially during the first 2 months after discontinuation of ZYPADHERA, is needed when switching to another antipsychotic product and is considered medically appropriate.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ZYPADHERA, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease.
QT interval In clinical trials with oral olanzapine, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.
However, as with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
The most commonly reported injection site related adverse event was pain (5%); some other injection site adverse events reported were (in decreasing frequency): nodule type reactions, erythema type reactions, non-specific injection site reactions, irritation, oedema type reactions, bruising, haemorrhage, and anesthesia.
Adults The most frequently (seen in ≥ 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, cholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, dizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue and oedema.
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/ l) which increased to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.016 mmol/ l - < 1.467 mmol/ l) to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l).
In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) for serotonin 5-HT2A/ 2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5; α -1 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors.
Total Positive and Negative Symptom Scores (PANSS) showed significant improvement from baseline (baseline mean Total PANSS Score 101) to endpoint (mean changes -22.57, -26.32, -22.49 respectively) with each dose of ZYPADHERA (405 mg every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 2 weeks, and 210 mg every 2 weeks) as compared to placebo (mean change -8.51).
The second, a long term study in clinically stable patients (n=1065) (baseline mean Total PANSS Score 54.33 to 57.75) who were initially treated with oral olanzapine for 4 to 8 weeks and then switched to continue on oral olanzapine or to ZYPADHERA for 24 weeks.
ZYPADHERA treatment groups of 150 mg and 300 mg given every 2 weeks (doses pooled for analysis) and 405 mg given every 4 weeks were non inferior to the combined doses of 10, 15 and 20 mg of oral olanzapine (doses pooled for analysis) as measured by rates of

Because immobilization increases the risk for venous thromboembolic events independent of therapy, FABLYN should be discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to and during prolonged immobilization (e. g., post-surgical recovery, prolonged bed rest), and therapy should be resumed only after the patient is fully ambulatory.
Based on the absence of clinically relevant effects of cholestyramine (anion exchange resin), fluconazole (CYP2C9 inhibitor), ketoconazole (CYP3A4/ 5 inhibitor) and paroxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor) on lasofoxifene pharmacokinetics, other anion exchange resins and other inhibitors of these CYP isoforms are unlikely to produce clinically meaningful alterations in FABLYN exposure and no dose adjustments are required.
In clinical studies, lasofoxifene did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) and chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1 substrate) or the pharmacokinetics of warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), methylprednisolone (CYP3A4 substrate) or digoxin (MDR1 P-glycoprotein substrate).
Through 5 years of follow-up, 37 FABLYN-treated women (1.3%, or 2.90 per 1,000 patients years) had a VTE compared to 18 placebo-treated women (0.6%, or 1.41 per 1,000 patients years) and the hazard ratio was 2.06 (95% CI:

In the osteoporosis treatment trials, FABLYN therapy resulted in consistent, statistically significant suppression of bone resorption and bone formation, as reflected by changes in serum and urine markers of bone turnover (e. g., C-telopeptide and markers of bone formation: osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase).
In a 3-year substudy of the PEARL study (n=760), FABLYN significantly increased BMD (compared to placebo) at lumbar spine (3.3%), total hip (3.0%), femoral neck (3.3%), greater trochanter (3.6%), intertrochanteric area (2.6%), Ward’ s triangle (5.9%) and forearm (1.8%) at 3 years.
An analysis was conducted of the subjects who were referred to their physician for consideration of treatment with an alternative osteoporosis medicinal product if one of the following was observed: a) ≥ 7% BMD loss at LS or ≥ 10% BMD loss at femoral neck at Month 12; b) ≥ 11% BMD loss at lumbar spine (LS) or ≥ 14% BMD loss at femoral neck at Month 24; c) ≥ 2 on-study radiographic vertebral fractures by Month 24.
In a subset of the study population designed to look at endometrial histology (1,080 patients) with a TVU at 3 years, histologically benign endometrial polyps were reported in 20 of 366 (5.5%) FABLYN-treated women and 12 of 360 (3.3%) placebo-treated women.
To assess the effect of FABLYN on diagnostic uterine procedures (i. e., hysteroscopy, saline infused sonohysterogram, endometrial biopsy, polypectomy or dilation and curettage), an analysis was conducted on women without planned TVU surveillance (4,055 patients).
Relative to placebo, FABLYN significantly decreased total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, LDL-associated apolipoprotein B-100, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (median changes -10.4%, -15.8%, -11.8%, -12.5%, respectively); no significant changes versus placebo were seen for HDL cholesterol or VLDL cholesterol.
Five metabolic pathways of lasofoxifene have been identified: direct glucuronidation; direct sulfation; hydroxylation at the phenyl tetraline moiety (with subsequent conjugative metabolism of the catechol intermediates by methylation and glucuronidation); oxidation at the pyrrolidine ring; and phenyl hydroxylation.
The binding affinities of the major circulating metabolites of lasofoxifene were at least 31-fold and 18-fold less than those of lasofoxifene for the estrogen receptor alpha and the estrogen receptor beta, respectively, indicating that these metabolites are unlikely to contribute to the pharmacologic activity of lasofoxifene.
In two-year carcinogenicity studies conducted in rats (≥ 1 mg/ kg/ day; 7 times systemic exposure following a human dose of 0.5 mg/ day based on plasma AUC) an increased incidence of renal tubular adenoma and carcinoma in males and granulosa cell tumours of the ovary in females was noted.
In the corresponding 2-year study in mice (≥ 2 mg/ kg/ day; less than systemic exposure following a human dose of 0.5 mg/ day based on plasma AUC), there was an increased incidence of adrenal cortical adenoma and carcinoma, interstitial cell tumors of the testis, benign and malignant ovarian tumors and benign uterine glandular polyps.

The amino acids at positions 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 of the natural GnRH decapeptide have been substituted resulting in N-Ac-D-Nal(2)1, D- -pClPhe2, D-Pal(3)3, D-hArg(Et2)6, L-hArg(Et2)8, D-Ala10]-GnRH with a molecular weight of 1570.4.
Do not use Orgalutran, − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to ganirelix or any of the other ingredients of Orgalutran; − if you are hypersensitive to gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) or a GnRH analogue; − if you have a moderate or severe kidney or liver disease; − if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to characteristics of the patients undergoing fertility treatment (e. g. age of the female, sperm characteristics) and to the higher incidence of multiple gestations after assisted reproduction techniques. The incidence of congenital malformations after assisted reproduction techniques using Orgalutran is not different from that after using other GnRH analogues in the course of assisted reproduction techniques.
Psychiatric and “ paradoxical” reactions Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusion, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character and other behavioural effects are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents.
Enhancement of the central sedation may occur in cases of concomitant use with antipsychotics (neuroleptics), hypnotics, anxiolytics/ sedatives, antidepressant agents, narcotic analgesics, anti-epileptic medicinal products, anaesthetics, and sedative antihistamines.
Cimetidine, a non-specific moderate inhibitor of several hepatic enzymes including both aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A4, produced an 85% increase in plasma concentrations of zaleplon because it inhibited both the primary (aldehyde oxidase) and secondary (CYP3A4) enzymes responsible for zaleplon’ s metabolism.
Frequencies are defined as Very common (≥ 1/ 10) Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10) Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) Very rare (< 1/ 10,000) not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)
Psychiatric and “ paradoxical” reactions Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusions, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character, and other adverse behavioural reactions are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents.
Consequently, the oral clearance of zaleplon was reduced by 70% and 87% in compensated and decompensated cirrhotic patients, respectively, leading to marked increases in mean Cmax and AUC (up to 4-fold and 7-fold in compensated and decompensated patients, respectively) relative to healthy subjects.
Repeated oral administration of zaleplon to rats and dogs elicited increases in liver and adrenal weights; however, these increases occurred at high multiples of the maximum therapeutic dose, were reversible, were not associated with degenerative microscopic changes in liver or adrenal glands, and were consistent with effects in animals with other compounds that bind to benzodiazepine receptors.

In one of these studies, after an initial dose of 1.0 mg/ kg every 2 weeks for 6 months, 0.3 mg/ kg every 2 weeks may maintain clearance of GL-3 in certain cell types in some patients; however, the long term clinical relevance of these findings has not been established (see section 5.1).
Over time, the majority of seropositive patients in clinical trials demonstrated either a downward trend in titers (based on a ≥ 4-fold reduction in titer from the peak measurement to the last measurement) (40% of the patients), tolerised (no detectable antibodies confirmed by 2 consecutive radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assays) (14% of the patients) or demonstrated a plateau (35% of the patients).
Patients experiencing mild or moderate infusion-associated reactions when treated with agalsidase beta during clinical trials have continued therapy after a reduction in the infusion rate (~0.15 mg/ min; 10 mg/ hr) and/ or pre-treatment with antihistamines, paracetamol, ibuprofen and/ or corticosteroids.
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported from clinical trials to be related to Fabrazyme administered at a dose of 1mg/ kg in a total of 168 patients (154 males and 14 females) treated with Fabrazyme for a minimum of one infusion up to a maximum of 5 years are listed by System Organ Class and frequency (very common ≥ 1/ 10; common ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 and uncommon ≥ 1/ 1000 to < 1/ 100) in the table below.
Additional symptoms included mild or moderate dyspnoea, throat tightness, chest discomfort, flushing, pruritus, urticaria, face oedema, angioneurotic oedema, rhinitis, bronchospasm, tachypnoea, wheezing, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, infusion-related pain including pain at the extremities, myalgia, and headache.
Following treatment with 1 mg/ kg every other week for 24 weeks, a dose regimen of 0.3 mg/ kg every 2 weeks for 18 months was able to maintain the clearance of cellular GL-3 in the capillary endothelium of the kidney, other kidney cell types and skin (superficial skin capillary endothelium) in the majority of patients.
Due to the limitations of the study design (small number of patients), no definitive conclusion regarding the dose maintenance regimen can be drawn, but these findings suggest that, after an initial debulking dose of 1.0 mg/ kg every 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/ kg every 2 weeks may be sufficient in some patients to maintain clearance of GL-3.
In one of these studies, after an initial dose of 1.0 mg/ kg every 2 weeks for 6 months, 0.3 mg/ kg every 2 weeks may maintain clearance of GL-3 in certain cell types in some patients; however, the long term clinical relevance of these findings has not been established (see section 5.1).

Tredaptive is indicated for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, particularly in patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia (characterised by elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol) and in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial).
Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-disposing factors for rhabdomyolysis. • Age > 70 years • Renal impairment • Uncontrolled hypothyroidism • Personal or familial history of hereditary muscular disorders • Previous history of muscular toxicity with a statin or fibrate • Alcohol abuse.
4 Acute coronary syndrome As with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, caution should be used when Tredaptive is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive medicinal products such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents.
In these studies, the percentage of patients taking Tredaptive, nicotinic acid (pooled prolonged-release formulations) or pooled placebo/ simvastatin who discontinued due to any flushing-related symptom (redness, warmth, itching and tingling) was 7.2%, 16.6%, and 0.4%, respectively.
7 Overall adverse reactions with Tredaptive In addition to flushing, clinical adverse reactions reported by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Tredaptive in ≥ 1% of patients treated with Tredaptive alone (n=947) or co-administered with statin (n=1601) and clinically meaningful adverse reactions (< 1%), for up to one year are listed below.
An apparent hypersensitivity reaction has been reported (< 1%) This is characterised by multiple symptoms that may include: angio-oedema, pruritus, erythema, paraesthesia, loss of consciousness, vomiting, urticaria, flushing, dyspnoea, nausea, incontinence of urine and stool, cold sweats, shivering, chills, increased blood pressure, lip swelling, burning sensation, drug eruption, arthralgia, leg swelling, and tachycardia.
Nicotinic acid-related adverse reactions The following nicotinic acid-related adverse reactions have been seen in clinical trials or post-marketing experience with other nicotinic acid medicinal products at unknown frequency or in clinical trials with Tredaptive (or the nicotinic acid component of Tredaptive) in < 1% of the patients treated:
The most commonly reported adverse reactions from the subjects who received this higher dose were consistent with a high dose of nicotinic acid and included: flushing, headache, pruritus, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric and abdominal pain/ discomfort, and back pain.
Nicotinic acid lowers the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B, the major LDL protein), triglycerides (TG), and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a), a modified LDL particle) and elevates the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I, the major protein component of HDL).
Nicotinic acid inhibits release of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue, which may contribute to the reduced plasma LDL-C, TC, VLDL-C, apo B, TG, and Lp(a), as well as elevated HDL-C, and apo A-I, all of which are associated with lower cardiovascular risk.
Patients receiving Tredaptive, nicotinic acid (prolonged-released formulation), or placebo were also taking statins (29% atorvastatin [5-80 mg], 54% simvastatin [10-80 mg], 17% other statins [2.5-180 mg] (pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin)), of which 9% were also taking ezetimibe [10 mg].
In a multicentre, double-blind, 12-week factorial study, Tredaptive 1000 mg/ 20 mg co-administered with simvastatin, when compared with simvastatin alone or Tredaptive 1000 mg/ 20 mg alone, for 4 weeks, significantly lowered LDL-C (-44.2%, -37.4%, -8.2% respectively), TG (-25.8%, -15.7%, -18.7% respectively), TC (-27.9%, -25.8%, -4.9% respectively) and significantly increased HDL-C (19.2%, 4.2%, 12.5% respectively).
Tredaptive (2000 mg/ 40 mg) co-administered with simvastatin when compared with simvastatin alone or Tredaptive (2000 mg/ 40 mg) alone for 12 weeks, significantly lowered LDL-C (-47.9%, -37.0%, -17.0% respectively), TG (-33.3%, -14.7%, -21.6% respectively), apo B
11 (-41.0%, -28.8%, -17.1% respectively), and TC (-29.6%, -24.9%, -9.1% respectively), as well as LDL-C: HDL-C (-57.1%, -39.8%, -31.2% respectively), non-HDL-C (-45.8%, -33.4%, -18.1% respectively), and TC: HDL-C (-43.0%, -28.0%, -24.9% respectively), and significantly increased HDL-C (27.5%, 6.0%, 23.4% respectively).
In patients continuing in the first study (24 weeks), the frequency of moderate or greater flushing in patients treated with Tredaptive declined and approached that of patients receiving placebo (see Figure 1), whereas in patients treated with nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation) the flushing frequency remained constant (after Week 6).
● Tredaptive (1000 mg/ 20 mg to 2000 mg/ 40 mg at week 5) ▲ Nicotinic acid (prolonged-release 1000 mg to 2000 mg at week 5) ○ Placebo *Includes patients with moderate, severe, or extreme flushing symptoms † Dose advancement at Week 5
In the second study (16 weeks) where acetylsalicylic acid was allowed, patients taking Tredaptive experienced significantly fewer days per week with moderate or greater flushing compared to nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation taken as a 12-week multi-step 500 mg to 2000 mg titration) (p < 0.001).
Absorption Nicotinic acid Following a 2000 mg dose of nicotinic acid administered orally as two modified-release tablets of nicotinic acid/ laropiprant with food, nicotinic acid was absorbed with a median time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of 4 hours, a mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-last) of approximately 58.0 μ M·hr and a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of approximately 20.2 μ M.
Laropiprant Following a 40 mg dose of laropiprant administered orally as two modified-release tablets of nicotinic acid/ laropiprant with food, laropiprant is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1 hour, a mean AUC0-∞ of approximately 13 μ M·hr, and a mean Cmax of approximately 1.6 μ M.
In in vitro studies, nicotinic acid and its metabolites did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4-mediated reactions or UGT1A1-mediated 3-glucuronidation of estradiol.
Reproduction toxicity studies showed slight treatment-related decreases in mean maternal weight gain and foetal body weight, slight increases in pup mortality, and increased incidence of supernumerary rib and incomplete ossification of the sternebra in the foetus were observed in rats at systemic exposure levels at least 513 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily human dose.

Tredaptive is used if you need to improve cholesterol and fat levels in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia): • when you cannot control your cholesterol levels with a statin (class of cholesterol-lowering medicines working in the liver); • when you cannot tolerate a statin or when a statin is not recommended for you.
Do not take Tredaptive if • you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nicotinic acid, to laropiprant, or to any of the other ingredients of Tredaptive (listed in section 6). • you currently have liver problems. • you have an ulcer in your stomach. • you have arterial bleeding.
Check with your doctor or pharmacist before and while taking your medicine if: • you have any allergies. • you have ever had liver disease, jaundice (a liver disorder causing yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), or hepatobiliary (liver and bile duct) disease. • you have kidney problems. • you have thyroid problems. • you drink large amounts of alcohol. • you or close family members have a hereditary muscle disorder, or you have ever had muscle problems during treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines called “ statins” or fibrates. • you have unexplained muscle pain, muscle tenderness, or muscle weakness.
Blood tests and monitoring • See your doctor regularly to check your LDL (bad) and HDL (good) cholesterol levels and your triglyceride level. • Your doctor should do a blood test before you start taking Tredaptive to check how well your liver is working. • Your doctor may also want you to periodically have blood tests after you start taking Tredaptive, to check how well your liver is working and for other side effects.
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: • medicines used to lower blood pressure. • medicines used to lower cholesterol called ‘ statins’, a class of medicine that works in the liver. • medicines used to lower cholesterol called ‘ bile acid sequestrants’, such as colestyramine. • zidovudine, a medicine used for HIV. • midazolam, a medicine to make you sleepy before some medical procedures. • vitamins or supplements that contain nicotinic acid. • clopidogrel, a medicine to help prevent harmful blood clots.
Taking Tredaptive with food and drink • Take Tredaptive with food. • To lower your chance of flushing, avoid drinking alcohol or hot drinks near the time you take your dose of Tredaptive. • It is important to follow the advice given in section 3 How to take Tredaptive.
If you take more Tredaptive than you should • In the event of an overdose, the following adverse events were reported: flushing, headache, pruritus (itching), nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain/ discomfort, and back pain. • If you take more than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away.

Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturbyour vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.

Take special care It is important that you tell your doctor if: • part of your stomach has been removed (partial gastrectomy) as the reliability of the test has not been proven in these patients. • you have or suspect you have a gastric infection. • you have long term stomach problems (atrophic gastritis) as the breath test may give the wrong result and other tests may be required to confirm the presence of H. pylori. • fasting (not taking food) may have medical implications for you. • you are under 18 years.
Each Pylobactell Breath Test kit contains: • 1 Sachet containing 1 tablet. • 6 glass tubes, 3 with white caps and 3 with red caps. • 30 ml glass mixing tube with cap. • 2 straws. • 1 Analysis Request Form. • 1 Security Label and 3 additional bar code labels.
InductOs is contraindicated for patients with: • Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients • Skeletal immaturity • Any active malignancy or patient undergoing treatment for a malignancy • An active infection at the operative site • Persistent compartment syndrome or neurovascular residua of compartment syndrome • Pathological fractures such as those observed in (but not limited to) Paget’ s disease or in metastatic bone
Common (≥1/100 to < 1/10) undesirable effects were observed with equal incidence in control and InductOs treatment groups, with the following four exceptions which were observed significantly more frequently in the InductOs treatment group than in the control group: • blood amylase increased (without overt signs of pancreatitis in InductOs treated patients), • tachycardia, • hypomagnesemia, • headache.
In the acute tibia fracture pivotal trial, InductOs increased the probability of fracture healing; patients treated with InductOs 1.5 mg/ml had a 44% reduced risk for treatment failure (secondary intervention to promote fracture healing) compared with patients in the standard-care group (RR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.78).
You should not receive InductOs • if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to dibotermin alfa or bovine collagen or any of the other ingredients of InductOs. • if you are still growing (skeletally immature). • if you have an active infection at the surgery site. • if the doctor treating you decides that you have inadequate blood supply at the fracture site. • for treating a fracture that is disease-related (eg. fractures due to Paget’s disease or cancer). • if you have been diagnosed with or are being treated for cancer.
Using InductOs with other medicines Some shin bone clinical trials have shown that if you are treated with InductOs and take pain medication such as aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, for a longer period of time (e.g. for more than 14 days) more fluid may discharge from your wound.
Localised swelling, in some cases resulting in breathing difficulties, has been reported in patients when InductOs has been used in surgery of the upper (neck) region of the spine.If any of the side effects get serious or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor.
In this type of surgery, InductOs can be used instead of a bone graft (bone that is taken from another part of the same patient’ s body or from a bone donor) in adults who have been treated for at least six months for back pain due to a damaged disc but have not had an operation. • surgery to heal fractures (breaks) of the tibia (shin bone).
InductOs should also not be used in the following situations: • patients who are still growing; • patients diagnosed with or being treated for cancer; • patients with an active infection at the surgery site; • patients with an inadequate blood supply at the fracture site; • treating a fracture that is related to a disease such as Paget’ s disease or cancer.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that InductOs’ s benefits are greater than its risks for single-level (L4 - S1) anterior lumbar spine fusion as a substitute for autogenous bone graft and for the treatment of acute tibia fractures in adults, as an adjunct to standard care.

Therefore, RotaTeq can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines [including hexavalent vaccines (DTaP- HBV-IPV/ Hib)]: diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), inactivated or oral poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV or OPV; see below), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
Otitis media and bronchospasm were reported in significantly more vaccine than placebo recipients overall; however, among cases that were considered to be vaccine-related in the opinion of the study investigator, the incidence of otitis media (0.3%) and bronchospasm (< 0.1%) was the same for vaccine and placebo recipients.
In 5,673 vaccinated infants (2,834 in the vaccine group) protective efficacy was measured as a reduction in the incidence of rotavirus (RV) gastroenteritis caused by vaccine G serotypes (G1-G4) that occurred at least 14 days after the third dose of vaccine through the first full rotavirus season after vaccination.
RotaTeq may be given at the same time as your child receives other normally recommended vaccinations, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated or oral poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.

In these patients, Velcade is used in combination with melphalan and prednisone (other medicines for multiple myeloma);  patients whose disease is progressive (getting worse) and who have failed to respond to at least one other treatment and have already had, or cannot undergo, a bone marrow transplant.
The most common side effects with Velcade (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are herpes zoster (shingles), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), neutropenia (too few of the white blood cells that fight infection), reduced appetite, peripheral neuropathy with paraesthesia (tingling or numbness and pins and needles), headache, dyspnoea (breathlessness), nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, rash, myalgia (muscle pain), fatigue (tiredness) and pyrexia (fever).
The company that makes Velcade will carry out further studies looking in particular at the distribution of Velcade in the body (especially after repeated doses), and at the risk of patients developing amyloidosis (a build-up of a type of protein called amyloid in the body) or of amyloidosis getting worse.
In patients with advanced myeloma the severity of thrombocytopenia was related to pre-treatment platelet count: for baseline platelet counts < 75,000/μ l, 90% of 21 patients had a count ≤ 25,000/ μ l during the study, including 14 %< 10,000/μl; in contrast, with a baseline platelet count > 75,000/μl, only 14% of 309 patients had a count ≤25×109/l during the study.
Improvement in, or resolution of, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 51% of patients with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy in the single-agent Phase III multiple myeloma study and 71% of patients with grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy leading to discontinuation of treatment in Phase II studies, respectively.
In a clinical trial, two patients (out of 2) given high-dose cytarabine (2 g/ m2 per day) by continuous infusion over 24 hours with daunorubicin and VELCADE for relapsed acute myelogenous leukaemia died of ARDS early in the course of therapy, and the study was terminated.
The following undesirable effects were considered by the investigators to have at least a possible or probable causal relationship to VELCADE during the conduct of 5 non-comparative Phase II studies and 1 comparative Phase III trial VELCADE vs. dexamethasone in 663 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, of whom 331 received VELCADE as single agent.

Following intravenous bolus administration of a 1.0 mg/ m2 and 1.3 mg/ m2 dose to 11 patients with multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values greater than 50 ml/ min, the mean first-dose maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ ml, respectively.
Mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 l/ h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/ m2 and 1.3 mg/ m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 l/ h and 18 to 32 l/ h following subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 mg/ m2 and 1.3 mg/ m2, respectively.
Normal (CrCL ≥ 60 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2, n=12), Mild (CrCL=40-59 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2, n=10), Moderate (CrCL=20-39 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2, n=9), and Severe (CrCL < 20 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2, n=3).
In multi-cycle general toxicity studies conducted in the rat and monkey, the principal target organs included the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in vomiting and/ or diarrhoea, haematopoietic and lymphatic tissues resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, lymphoid tissue atrophy and hematopoietic bone marrow hypocellularity: peripheral neuropathy (observed in monkeys, mice and dogs) involving sensory nerve axons; and mild changes in the kidneys.
Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 2.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

Concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazol, posaconazol, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone) (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Caution should be exercised when prescribing or uptitrating ranolazine to patients in whom an increased exposure is expected: • Concomitant administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). • Concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). • Mild hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). • Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30– 80 ml/ min) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). • Elderly (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). • Patients with low weight (≤ 60 kg) (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). • Patients with moderate to severe CHF (NYHA Class III– IV) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
A population-based analysis of combined data from patients and healthy volunteers demonstrated that the slope of the plasma concentration-QTc relationship was estimated to be 2.4 msec per 1000 ng/ ml, which is approximately equal to a 2- to 7-msec increase over the plasma concentration range for ranolazine 500 to 1000 mg twice daily.
Combining ranolazine with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone) is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Examples of such drugs include certain antihistamines (e. g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine), certain antiarrhythmics (e. g. quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), erythromycin, and tricyclic antidepressants (e. g. imipramine, doxepin, amitriptyline).
Evaluations in patients who may be considered at higher risk of adverse events when treated with other antianginal medicinal products, e. g. patients with diabetes, Class I and II heart failure, or obstructive airway disease, confirmed that these conditions were not associated with clinically meaningful increases in the incidence of adverse events.
Of the most commonly reported, the following events occurred more often with Ranexa (placebo-corrected frequencies) in elderly (≥ 75 years of age) than younger patients (< 75 years of age): constipation (8% versus 5%), nausea (6% versus 3%), hypotension (5% versus 1%), and vomiting (4% versus 1%).
In general, the type and frequency of adverse events reported in patients with low body weight (≤ 60 kg) were similar to those of patients with higher weight (> 60 kg); however, the placebo- corrected frequencies of the following common adverse events were higher in low body weight than heavier patients: nausea (14% versus 2%), vomiting (6% versus 1%), and hypotension (4% versus 2%).
In a large outcome study (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in 6,560 patients with UA/ NSTEMI ACS, there was no difference between Ranexa and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99), sudden cardiac death (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.87), or the frequency of symptomatic documented arrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%).
8 death (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.87), or the frequency of symptomatic documented arrhythmias (3.0% versus 3.1%) between Ranexa and placebo when added to standard medical therapy (including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, anti-platelet agents, lipid-lowering medicinal products, and ACE inhibitors).
In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, steady-state Cmax was, on average, approximately 1770 (SD 1040) ng/ ml, and steady-state AUC0-12 was, on average, 13,700 (SD 8290) ng x h/ ml following a dose of 500 mg twice daily.

The most common side effects with Tasmar (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are nausea (feeling sick), anorexia (loss of appetite), diarrhoea, dyskinesia (uncontrollable movements), dystonia (muscle spasms), headache, dizziness, sleep disorders, excessive dreaming, somnolence (sleepiness), confusion, hallucination (seeing things that are not there) and orthostatic complaints (dizziness on standing).
It should not be used in patients with: • signs of liver disease or increased liver enzymes, • phaeochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland), • a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a dangerous nervous disorder usually caused by antipsychotic medicines), rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle fibres) or hyperthermia (heat stroke), • severe dyskinesia.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Tasmar’ s benefits are greater than its risks in combination with levodopa/ benserazide or levodopa/ carbidopa for use in patients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’ s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to respond to or are intolerant of other COMT inhibitors.
• Evidence of liver disease or increased liver enzymes • Severe dyskinesia • A previous history of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom Complex (NMS) and / or non- traumatic Rhabdomyolysis or Hyperthermia. • Hypersensitivity to tolcapone or any of its other ingredients. • Phaeochromocytoma.
Treatment should be immediately discontinued if ALT and/ or AST exceed the upper limit of normal or if symptoms or signs suggesting the onset of hepatic failure (persistent nausea, fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, right upper quadrant tenderness) develop.
NMS is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus and tremor), mental status changes (agitation, confusion, stupor and coma), elevated temperature, autonomic dysfunction (labile blood pressure, tachycardia) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) which may be a consequence of myolysis.
Patients being treated with Levodopa and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also Section 4.4)
Tolcapone’ s effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics is similar with all pharmaceutical formulations of levodopa/ benserazide and levodopa/ carbidopa; it is independent of levodopa dose, levodopa/ AADC-I (benserazide or carbidopa) ratio and the use of sustained-release formulations.

The Insulin Human Winthrop range is comprised of fast-acting insulin solutions (Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid and Insulin Human Winthrop Infusat) that contain soluble insulin, an intermediate-acting insulin suspension (Insulin Human Winthrop Basal) that contains isophane insulin, and combinations of fast- and intermediate- acting in various proportions (Insulin Human Winthrop Comb): • Insulin Human Winthrop Comb 15:
Insulin Human Winthrop Rapid can also be used for the treatment of hyperglycaemic coma (coma caused by too much blood glucose [sugar]) and ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones [acids] in the blood), and to control blood glucose before, during or after an operation.
Without the enzyme, glucocerebroside builds up in the body, typically in the liver, spleen and bone marrow, and this produces the symptoms of the disease: anaemia (low blood count), tiredness, easy bruising and a tendency to bleed, an enlarged spleen and liver, and bone pain and fractures.
Cerezyme is used in patients who have type 1 (non-neuronopathic) or type 3 (chronic neuronopathic) Gaucher disease and who have one or more of the following conditions caused by the disease: • anaemia (low red blood cell counts), • thrombocytopenia (a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood), • bone disease, • hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) or splenomegaly (enlarged spleen).

Telzir must not be used in patients who are taking rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis), St John’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as Telzir or ritonavir and are harmful at high levels in the blood.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Telzir, which contains a prodrug of amprenavir, provides an advantage for patients, as the number of tablets they need to take is reduced when compared to the number of Agenerase capsules that they would need to take for the same dose of amprenavir.
Even with these dose adjustments for adults, some patients with hepatic impairment may have higher or lower than anticipated amprenavir and/ or ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to patients with normal hepatic function, due to increased inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), therefore a close monitoring of safety and virologic response is warranted.
Telzir must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), e. g. amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, terfenadine, oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), oral triazolam.
Telzir with ritonavir should be used with caution and at reduced doses in adults with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.
Concomitant use of Telzir with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Co-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these active substances thus increasing their plasma level and leading to serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions such as cardiac arrhythmia (e. g. amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, terfenadine) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia (e. g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine).
Based on data derived from these studies and because ritonavir is not expected to 7 have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of NRTIs, the co-administration of fosamprenavir and ritonavir with these medicinal products is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of the co-administered active substances.
Co-administration of increased doses of fosamprenavir 1400mg twice daily with lopinavir/ ritonavir 533/ 133mg twice daily to PI-experienced patients resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and elevations in triglycerides with the combination regimen without increases in virological efficacy, when compared with standard doses of fosamprenavir/ ritonavir.
Ketoconazole / Itraconazole: co-administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and ketoconazole 200 mg once daily increased plasma ketoconazole Cmax by 25% and increased AUC(0-τ) to values 2.69-fold those observed on administration of ketoconazole 200 mg once daily without concurrent fosamprenavir with ritonavir.
Rifabutin: compared to rifabutin administered alone (300 mg once daily), plasma rifabutin AUC (0- 48) was unchanged and Cmax was decreased 14% following co-administration of reduced doses of rifabutin (150 mg every other day) with fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.
The AUC and Cmax of amprenavir were decreased by 18% and 35% respectively, whilst the Cmin (C12h) was comparable, when a single 1400 mg dose of fosamprenavir was co-administered with a single 30 ml dose of antacid suspension (equivalent to 3.6 grams aluminium hydroxide and 1.8 grams magnesium hydroxide).
Based on data for ritonavir and other protease inhibitors, plasma concentrations of PDE5 inhibitors (e. g. sildenafil and vardenafil) are expected to substantially increase when co-administered with Telzir with ritonavir and may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, visual changes and priapism.
Fluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e. g. budesonide.
Methadone: co-administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with methadone once daily (≤ 200 mg) for 14 days decreased the active (R-) methadone enantiomer AUC(0- τ) and Cmax by 18% and 21% respectively.
Steady state plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were not significantly affected by co-administration with this oral contraceptive; however, ritonavir AUC(0- τ) and Cmax were 45% and 63% higher, respectively, compared to historical data in female subjects dosed with fosamprenavir / ritonavir alone.
The adverse event profile in children and adolescents is based on integrated safety data from two studies (APV29005 and APV20003) in which 126 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to 18 years of age received fosamprenavir with ritonavir with background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1 for information on dosing regimens applied for each age group).
Clinical chemistry abnormalities: clinical chemistry abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) potentially related to treatment with fosamprenavir with ritonavir and reported in greater than or equal to 1% of adult patients, included: increased ALT (common), AST (common), serum lipase (common) and triglycerides (very common).
Lipodystrophy: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump) (see section 4.4).
Administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily results in plasma amprenavir concentrations (data from study APV30003 in antiretroviral experienced patients) which results in protein adjusted median ratios of Cmin/ IC50 and Cmin/ IC95 of 21.7 (range 1.19-240) and 3.21 (range 0.26-30.0), respectively.

L10F/ I/ V, L33F, M36I, I54A/ L/ M/ S/ T/ V, I62V, V82A/ C/ F/ G, I84V and L90M and is associated with increased phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).
Based on data from twenty-five antiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen (one of whom showed Baseline resistance to lopinavir and saquinavir and another to tipranavir the resistance pathways associated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to atazanavir/ ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), darunavir/ ritonavir (four of 25 isolates), indinavir/ ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), lopinavir/ ritonavir (three of 24 isolates, saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir/ ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).
Two studies performed in antiretroviral naïve patients, one in comparison to nelfinavir (study APV30002) and one in comparison to lopinavir / ritonavir (study ESS100732), and one study in antiretroviral experienced patients, in comparison to lopinavir / ritonavir (study APV30003).
In antiretroviral naïve patients in APV30002, fosamprenavir (1400 mg) given once daily in combination with low dose ritonavir (200 mg) as part of a triple regimen including abacavir (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) showed similar efficacy over 48 weeks compared to nelfinavir (1250 mg) given twice daily in combination with abacavir with lamivudine (300 and 150 mg twice daily).
In a subsequent randomised open-label study (ESS100732) in antiretroviral naïve patients, fosamprenavir (700 mg) co-administered with low dose ritonavir (100 mg) in a twice daily regimen including abacavir / lamivudine (600 mg / 300 mg) fixed dose combination tablet once daily showed comparable efficacy over 48 weeks to lopinavir / ritonavir (400 mg / 100 mg) given twice daily in combination with abacavir / lamivudine (600 mg / 300 mg once daily).
In the Time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) analysis for the ITT(E) population, the proportion of patients achieving < 400 copies/ ml was 73% (315 / 434) in the fosamprenavir with ritonavir group compared to 71% (317 / 444) of patients receiving lopinavir / ritonavir, with a 95% confidence interval of the difference of [-4,84%; 7; 05%].
In a randomised open-label study (APV30003) in protease inhibitor experienced patients with virological failure (less than or equal to two PIs) the fosamprenavir with ritonavir combination (700 / 100 mg twice daily or 1400 / 200 mg once daily) did not demonstrate non-inferiority to lopinavir / ritonavir with regard to viral suppression as measured by the average area under the curve minus baseline (AAUCMB) for plasma HIV-1 RNA over 48 weeks (the primary end point).
17 In patients with high viral load at baseline (> 100,000 copies/ ml) 7/ 14 (50%) patients in the lopinavir / ritonavir group and 6/ 19 (32%) patients in the fosamprenavir with ritonavir group had plasma HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ ml.
The benefit in this age group has mainly been derived from the ongoing study, APV29005, an open label 48 week study evaluating the pharmacokinetic profiles, safety, and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir with ritonavir administered twice daily to HIV 1 protease inhibitor experienced and naive patients 2 to 18 years of age.
After multiple dose oral administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, amprenavir was rapidly absorbed with a geometric mean (95% CI) steady state peak plasma amprenavir concentration (Cmax) of 6.08 (5.38-6.86) µg/ ml occurring approximately 1.5 (0.75-5.0) hours after dosing (tmax).
Children 6 to 11 years of age (n=9) receiving fosamprenavir / ritonavir 18 / 3 mg/ kg twice daily had 26% higher AUC(0-24) and similar Cmax and Cmin values when compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir / ritonavir 700 / 100 mg twice daily.
Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily, a subset of five pediatric subjects ages 6 to < 24-months receiving fosamprenavir / ritonavir 45/ 7 mg/ kg twice daily demonstrated that despite an approximate 5-fold increase in fosamprenavir and ritonavir doses on a mg/ kg basis, plasma amprenavir AUC(0-τ) was approximately 48% lower, Cmax 26% lower, and Cτ 29% lower in the paediatric subjects.
In subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 5-6), the dosage regimen of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily provided slightly higher plasma amprenavir Cmax (17%), slightly higher plasma amprenavir AUC(0-12) (22%), similar plasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 117% higher plasma unbound amprenavir C12 values compared to subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir / ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7-9), a reduced dose of fosamprenavir 450 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily is 20 predicted to deliver similar plasma amprenavir Cmax and AUC(0-12), but approximately 35% lower plasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 88% higher plasma unbound amprenavir C12 values than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.
In subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10-13), a reduced dose of fosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but similar unbound plasma amprenavir C12 values than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.
Despite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% higher ritonavir Cmax, 40% higher ritonavir AUC(0-24), and 38% higher ritonavir C12 than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.
In long-term carcinogenicity studies with fosamprenavir in mice and rats, there were increases in hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in mice at exposure levels equivalent to 0.1 to 0.3-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100mg ritonavir twice daily, and increases in hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in rats at exposure levels equivalent to 0.3 to 0.6-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100mg ritonavir twice daily.
Even with these dose adjustments for adults with, some patients with hepatic impairment may have higher or lower than anticipated amprenavir and/ or ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to patients with normal hepatic function, due to increased inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), therefore a close monitoring of safety and virologic response is warranted.

Co-administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily + ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) 0.035 mg/ norethisterone (NE) 0.5 mg once daily decreased plasma EE AUC(0- τ) and Cmax by 37% and 28%, respectively, and decreased plasma NE AUC(0-τ), Cmax, and Cτ by 34%, 38%, and 26%, respectively.
Steady state plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were not significantly affected by co-administration with this oral contraceptive; however, ritonavir AUC(0- τ) and Cmax were 45% and 63% higher, respectively, compared to historical data in female subjects dosed with fosamprenavir / ritonavir alone.
APV30003 in protease inhibitor experienced patients, fosamprenavir given in combination with low dose ritonavir either once daily (1400 mg / 200 mg) (n = 106) or twice daily (700 mg / 100 mg) (n = 106) in combination with two active reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs).
The adverse event profile in children and adolescents is based on integrated safety data from two studies (APV29005 and APV20003) in which 126 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to 18 years of age received fosamprenavir with ritonavir with background nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1 for information on dosing regimens applied for each age group).

In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7-9), a reduced dose of fosamprenavir 450 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily is predicted to deliver similar plasma amprenavir Cmax and AUC(0-12), but approximately 35% lower plasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 88% higher plasma unbound amprenavir C12 values than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.
In subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10-13), a reduced dose of fosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but similar unbound plasma amprenavir C12 values than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.
Despite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% higher ritonavir Cmax, 40% higher ritonavir AUC(0-24), and 38% higher ritonavir C12 than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.
In long-term carcinogenicity studies with fosamprenavir in mice and rats, there were increases in hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in mice at exposure levels equivalent to 0.1 to 0.3-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100mg ritonavir twice daily, and increases in hepatocellular adenomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas in rats at exposure levels equivalent to 0.3 to 0.6-fold those in humans given 700 mg of fosamprenavir plus 100mg ritonavir twice daily.

For patients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy For patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Efficib should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken.
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with the maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea The dose of Efficib should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken.
In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
Sitagliptin and metformin Adverse reactions considered as drug related reported in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of placebo and in patients receiving sitagliptin in combination with metformin in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency (Table 1).
1 In this placebo-controlled 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to treatment with placebo added to ongoing metformin was 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
In an additional 1-year study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to sulphonylurea added to ongoing metformin was 14.5% and 30.3%, respectively.
In pooled studies of up to 1 year in duration comparing sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin to a sulphonylurea agent added to ongoing metformin, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulphonylurea agent are as follows: anorexia (Metabolism and nutritional disorders; frequency uncommon) and weight decreased (Investigations; frequency uncommon).
In a 24-week study of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin administered twice daily (sitagliptin/ metformin 50 mg/ 500 mg or 50 mg/ 1,000 mg), the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with placebo was 14.0% and 9.7%, respectively.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0% each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7%), with the differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
Additional information on the individual active substances of the fixed dose combination Sitagliptin In addition, in monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks in duration of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily alone compared to placebo, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness.
During post-marketing experience of Efficib or sitagliptin, one of the active substances of Efficib, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported (frequency not known): hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (see section 4.4).
Efficib combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: sitagliptin phosphate, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
Sitagliptin differs in chemical structure and pharmacological action from GLP-1 analogues, insulin, sulphonylureas or meglitinides, biguanides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists, alpha- glucosidase inhibitors, and amylin analogues.
Overall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used in combination with metformin (as initial or add-on therapy) and in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, as measured by clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint (see Table 3).
Studies of sitagliptin in combination with metformin In a 24-week, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily to ongoing metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared with placebo.
In a 52-week study, comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide (a sulphonylurea agent) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, sitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c (-0.7% mean change from baselines at week 52, with baseline HbA1c of approximately 7.5% in both groups).
group (29.8 events/ 1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups (40.1 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034
Sitagliptin Absorption Following oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 μ M• hr, Cmax was 950 nM.
The study included patients with renal insufficiency classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (50 to < 80 ml/ min), moderate (30 to < 50 ml/ min), and severe (< 30 ml/ min), as well as patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis.
For patients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy For patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Efficib should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken.

Silgard is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1).
HPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers; 80% of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); 45-70% of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3); 25% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1); approximately 70% of HPV related high- grade vulvar (VIN 2/ 3) and vaginal (VaIN 2/ 3) intraepithelial neoplasia.
The term "premalignant genital lesions" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/ 3) and high- grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/ 3).
The primary efficacy endpoints included HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related vulvar and vaginal lesions (genital warts, VIN, VaIN) and CIN of any grade (Protocol 013, FUTURE I), HPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/ 3 and AIS (Protocol 015, FUTURE II), HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection (Protocol 007), and HPV 16-related persistent infection (Protocol 005).
In the second CIN 3 case observed in a patient infected with HPV 51 at Day 1 (in 2 of 9 specimens); HPV 16 was detected at a Month 51 biopsy (in 1 of 9 specimens) and HPV 56 was detected in 3 of 9 specimens at Month 52 in tissue excised during LEEP. ***Patients were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.6 years) Note:
In the HPV naïve population (naïve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1), Silgard reduced the proportion of women who experienced, a definitive cervical therapy procedure (Loop Electro-Excision Procedure or Cold-Knife Conization) by 41.9% (95% CI:
The efficacy of Silgard against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/ 3 or AIS caused by 10 non-vaccine HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) structurally related to HPV 16 or HPV 18 was evaluated in the combined Phase III efficacy database (N = 17,599) after a median follow-up of 3.7 years (at end of study).
The immunogenicity of Silgard was assessed in 8,915 (Silgard n = 4,666; placebo n = 4,249) women 18 to 26 years of age and 3,400 female (Silgard n = 1,471; placebo n = 583) and male (Silgard n = 1,071; placebo n = 275) adolescents 9 to 17 years of age.
In the clinical studies, 99.9%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.6% of individuals who received Silgard became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18-seropositive respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3 across all age groups tested.
Silgard is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1).

Silgard is used to vaccinate against precancerous lesions (abnormal cell growth) in the genital area (cervix, vulva or vagina), cancer of the cervix and genital warts that are caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 or 18. The effectiveness of Silgard has been studied in women aged 16 to 26 years, and its immunogenicity (its ability to make the immune system respond to the viruses) has been studied in children and adolescents aged nine to 15 years.
Looking at the results of all four studies together, in women who had never been infected by HPV types 6, 11, 16 or 18 before, and who received the full course of vaccination, one woman out of over 8,000 vaccinated with Silgard developed a precancerous lesion in the cervix that might have been due to HPV type 16 or 18.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Silgard’ s benefits are greater than its risks as a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.

Shortening the treatment duration in patients with genotype 1 and high viral load (HVL) (> 800, 000 IU/ ml) at baseline who become HCV RNA negative at week 4 and remain HCV RNA negative at week 24 should be considered with even more caution since the limited data available suggest that this may significantly negatively impact the sustained virologic response.

Use of peginterferon as long term maintenance monotherapy (unapproved use) In a randomised, controlled US study (HALT-C) of HCV non-responder patients with varied degrees of fibrosis where 3.5 years of treatment with 90 micrograms/ week of Pegasys monotherapy was studied, no significant reductions were observed in the rate of fibrosis progression or related clinical events.
Administration of Pegasys 180 micrograms once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy male subjects did not show any effect on mephenytoin, dapsone, debrisoquine and tolbutamide pharmacokinetics profiles, suggesting that Pegasys has no effect on in vivo metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 isozymes.
In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 HCV patients concomitantly receiving methadone maintenance therapy (median dose 95 mg; range 30 mg to 150 mg), treatment with Pegasys 180 micrograms sc once weekly for 4 weeks was associated with mean methadone levels that were 10% to 15% higher than at baseline.
HIV-HCV co-infected patients No apparent evidence of drug interaction was observed in 47 HIV-HCV co-infected patients who completed a 12 week pharmacokinetic substudy to examine the effect of ribavirin on the intracellular phosphorylation of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine or stavudine).
With the exception of pyrexia the frequency of the majority of the reported adverse reactions was notably less in CHB patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy compared with HCV patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy (see Table 4) Adverse events were experienced by 88% of Pegasys-treated patients as compared with 53% of patients in the lamivudine comparator group, while 6% of the Pegasys-treated and 4% of the lamivudine-treated patients experienced serious adverse events during the studies.
Haematologic laboratory abnormalities observed during the first 20 weeks of the trial included anemia (26% of patients experienced a hemoglobin level of < 10 g/ dL), neutropenia (30% experienced an ANC < 750/ mm3), and thrombocytopenia (13% experienced a platelet count < 50,000/ mm3) (see section 4.4).
In HIV-HCV co-infected patients, the clinical adverse event profiles reported for Pegasys, alone or in combination with ribavirin, were similar to those observed in HCV mono-infected patients For HIV- HCV patients receiving Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy other undesirable effects have been reported in ≥ 1% to ≤ 2% of patients: hyperlactacidaemia/ lactic acidosis, influenza, pneumonia, affect lability, apathy, tinnitus, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cheilitis, acquired lipodystrophy and chromaturia.
Treatment with Pegasys was associated with decreases in haematological values (leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and haemoglobin), which generally improved with dose modification, and returned to pre-treatment levels within 4-8 weeks upon cessation of therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
0.749 - 0.5 x 109/ l) and severe (ANC: < 0.5 x 109/ l) neutropenia was observed respectively in 24% (216/ 887) and 5% (41/ 887) of patients receiving Pegasys 180 micrograms and ribavirin 1000/ 1200 milligrams for 48 weeks.
Dose-response in monotherapy In a direct comparison with 90 micrograms, the 180 micrograms-dose was associated with superior sustained virological response in patients with cirrhosis, but in a study in non-cirrhotic patients very similar results were obtained with doses of 135 micrograms and 180 micrograms.
The virological responses of HCV monoinfected patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy and with Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy in relation to genotype and pre-treatment viral load and in relation to genotype, pre-treatment viral load and rapid virological response at week 4 are summarised in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively.
Chronic hepatitis C prior treatment non-responder patients In study MV17150, patients who were non-responders to previous therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin were randomized to four different treatments: • Pegasys 360 mcg/ week for 12 weeks, followed by 180 mcg/ week for a further 60 weeks • Pegasys 360 mcg/ week for 12 weeks, followed by 180 mcg/ week for a further 36 weeks • Pegasys 180 mcg/ week for 72 weeks • Pegasys 180 mcg/ week for 48 weeks All patients received ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg/ day) in combination with Pegasys.

In the HALT-C study, patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who were non-responders to previous treatment with interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy or in combination therapy with ribavirin were treated with Pegasys 180 mcg/ week and ribavirin 1000/ 1200 mg daily.
HCV patients with normal ALT In study NR16071, HCV patients with normal ALT values were randomised to receive Pegasys 180 micrograms/ week and ribavirin 800 milligrams/ day for either 24 or 48 weeks followed by a 24 week treatment free follow-up period or no treatment for 72 weeks.

In a clinical trial of non-responder patients to prior pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ ribavirin, which exposed patients to either 48 or 72 weeks of treatment, the frequency of withdrawal for adverse events or laboratory abnormalities from Pegasys treatment and ribavirin treatment was 6% and 7%, respectively, in the 48 week arms and 12% and 13%, respectively, in the 72 week arms.
Haematologic laboratory abnormalities observed during the first 20 weeks of the trial included anemia (26% of patients experienced a hemoglobin level of < 10 g/ dL), neutropenia (30% experienced an ANC < 750/ mm3), and thrombocytopenia (13% experienced a platelet count < 50,000/ mm3) (see section 4.4).

Chronic hepatitis C prior treatment non-responder patients In study MV17150, patients who were non-responders to previous therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin were randomized to four different treatments: • Pegasys 360 mcg/ week for 12 weeks, followed by 180 mcg/ week for a further 60 weeks • Pegasys 360 mcg/ week for 12 weeks, followed by 180 mcg/ week for a further 36 weeks • Pegasys 180 mcg/ week for 72 weeks • Pegasys 180 mcg/ week for 48 weeks All patients received ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg/ day) in combination with Pegasys.

In the HALT-C study, patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who were non-responders to previous treatment with interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy or in combination therapy with ribavirin were treated with Pegasys 180 mcg/ week and ribavirin 1000/ 1200 mg daily.
HCV patients with normal ALT In study NR16071, HCV patients with normal ALT values were randomised to receive Pegasys 180 micrograms/ week and ribavirin 800 milligrams/ day for either 24 or 48 weeks followed by a 24 week treatment free follow-up period or no treatment for 72 weeks.
Shortening the treatment duration in patients with genotype 1 and high viral load (HVL) (> 800, 000 IU/ ml) at baseline who become HCV RNA negative at week 4 and remain HCV RNA negative at week 24 should be considered with even more caution since the limited data available suggest that this may significantly negatively impact the sustained virologic response.

Use of peginterferon as long term maintenance monotherapy (unapproved use) In a randomised, controlled US study (HALT-C) of HCV non-responder patients with varied degrees of fibrosis where 3.5 years of treatment with 90 micrograms/ week of Pegasys monotherapy was studied, no significant reductions were observed in the rate of fibrosis progression or related clinical events.
Administration of Pegasys 180 micrograms once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy male subjects did not show any effect on mephenytoin, dapsone, debrisoquine and tolbutamide pharmacokinetics profiles, suggesting that Pegasys has no effect on in vivo metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 isozymes.
In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 HCV patients concomitantly receiving methadone maintenance therapy (median dose 95 mg; range 30 mg to 150 mg), treatment with Pegasys 180 micrograms sc once weekly for 4 weeks was associated with mean methadone levels that were 10% to 15% higher than at baseline.
HIV-HCV co-infected patients No apparent evidence of drug interaction was observed in 47 HIV-HCV co-infected patients who completed a 12 week pharmacokinetic substudy to examine the effect of ribavirin on the intracellular phosphorylation of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine or stavudine).
The frequency and severity of the most commonly reported adverse reactions with Pegasys are similar to those reported with interferon alfa-2a (see Table 4). The most frequently reported adverse reactions with Pegasys 180 micrograms were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.
In a clinical trial of non-responder patients to prior pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ ribavirin, which exposed patients to either 48 or 72 weeks of treatment, the frequency of withdrawal for adverse events or laboratory abnormalities from Pegasys treatment and ribavirin treatment was 6% and 7%, respectively, in the 48 week arms and 12% and 13%, respectively, in the 72 week arms.
Haematologic laboratory abnormalities observed during the first 20 weeks of the trial included anemia (26% of patients experienced a hemoglobin level of < 10 g/ dL), neutropenia (30% experienced an ANC < 750/ mm3), and thrombocytopenia (13% experienced a platelet count < 50,000/ mm3) (see section 4.4).
In HIV-HCV co-infected patients, the clinical adverse event profiles reported for Pegasys, alone or in combination with ribavirin, were similar to those observed in HCV mono-infected patients For HIV- HCV patients receiving Pegasys and ribavirin combination therapy other undesirable effects have been reported in ≥ 1% to ≤ 2% of patients: hyperlactacidaemia/ lactic acidosis, influenza, pneumonia, affect lability, apathy, tinnitus, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cheilitis, acquired lipodystrophy and chromaturia.
Treatment with Pegasys was associated with decreases in haematological values (leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and haemoglobin), which generally improved with dose modification, and returned to pre-treatment levels within 4-8 weeks upon cessation of therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
0.749 - 0.5 x 109/ l) and severe (ANC: < 0.5 x 109/ l) neutropenia was observed respectively in 24% (216/ 887) and 5% (41/ 887) of patients receiving Pegasys 180 micrograms and ribavirin 1000/ 1200 milligrams for 48 weeks.

With the exception of pyrexia the frequency of the majority of the reported adverse reactions was notably less in CHB patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy compared with HCV patients treated with Pegasys monotherapy (see Table 4). Adverse events were experienced by 88% of Pegasys-treated patients as compared with 53% of patients in the lamivudine comparator group, while 6% of the Pegasys-treated and 4% of the lamivudine-treated patients experienced serious adverse events during the studies.
In a clinical trial of non-responder patients to prior pegylated interferon alfa-2b/ ribavirin, which exposed patients to either 48 or 72 weeks of treatment, the frequency of withdrawal for adverse events or laboratory abnormalities from Pegasys treatment and ribavirin treatment was 6% and 7%, respectively, in the 48 week arms and 12% and 13%, respectively, in the 72 week arms.

It is used in patients who have compensated liver disease (when the liver is damaged but works normally), who also show signs that the virus is still multiplying, and have signs of liver damage (raised levels of alanine aminotransferase [ALT], a liver enzyme, and signs of damage when liver tissue is examined under a microscope); • chronic hepatitis C (a disease of the liver due to infection with the hepatitis C virus).
Additional studies looking at the combination of Pegasys and ribavirin included one study comparing two doses and two durations of treatment (24 or 48 weeks) in 1,285 patients, one study comparing 16 and 24 weeks of treatment in 1,469 patients, one study in 514 patients with normal ALT levels, one study in 860 patients who were also infected with HIV, and a final study in 950 patients who did not respond to previous treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.
In chronic hepatitis B, two studies have been carried out comparing Pegasys with lamivudine (another antiviral medicine) in 820 ‘ HBeAg-positive’ patients (infected with the common type of the hepatitis B virus) and in 552 ‘ HBeAg-negative ’ patients (infected with a virus that has mutated [changed], leading to a form of chronic hepatitis B that is more difficult to treat).
The most common side effects with Pegasys (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are anorexia (loss of appetite), headache, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), irritability, depression, dizziness, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, abdominal (tummy) pain, alopecia (hair loss), pruritus (itching), myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), fatigue (tiredness), pyrexia (fever), rigors (shaking chills), reactions at the site of the injection and pain.

The dose of PritorPlus to be used depends on the dose of telmisartan that the patient was taking before: patients who were receiving 40 mg telmisartan should take the 40/ 12.5 mg tablets, and patients who were receiving 80 mg telmisartan should take the 80/ 12.5 mg tablets.
The most common side effects with PritorPlus (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are bronchitis (inflammation of the lungs), pharyngitis (sore throat), sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses, air-filled passageways in the bones around the nose and eyes), upper respiratory tract infections (colds), urinary tract infections (infections of the structures that carry urine), hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol levels), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels), anxiety, dizziness, vertigo (a spinning sensation), abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia (heartburn), gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), eczema (itchy, scaly skin), arthralgia (joint pain), osteoarthritis (swelling and pain in the joints), muscle spasms, pain in the extremities (arms and legs), myalgia (muscle pain), erectile dysfunction (inability to get or keep an erection), flu-like illness and pain.
2 • Hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived substances (since hydrochlorothiazide is a sulphonamide-derived medicinal product). • Second and third trimester of pregnancy and lactation (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). • Cholestasis and biliary obstructive disorders. • Severe hepatic impairment. • Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min). • Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia.
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are dryness of mouth, thirst, asthenia, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8).
The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients with cirrhosis of liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see section 4.5).
Periodic monitoring of serum potassium and ECG is recommended when PritorPlus is administered with these medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e. g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics) and the following torsades de pointes inducing medicinal products (which include some antiarrhythmics), hypokalaemia being a predisposing factor to torsades de pointes.
NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti- inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
Toxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury.

NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti- inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (eg dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
Toxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury.
PritorPlus fixed dose combination (80 mg telmisartan/ 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on PritorPlus 80 mg/ 12.5 mg (80 mg telmisartan/ 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) or patients who have been previously stabilised on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately.
• Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). • Hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived substances (since hydrochlorothiazide is a sulphonamide-derived medicinal product). • Second and third trimester of pregnancy and lactation (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). • Cholestasis and biliary obstructive disorders. • Severe hepatic impairment. • Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min). • Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia.
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are dryness of mouth, thirst, asthenia, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8).

In a double-blind controlled clinical trial (n=687 patients evaluated for efficacy) in non-responders to the 80 mg/ 12.5 mg combination, an incremental blood pressure lowering effect of the 80 mg/ 25 mg combination compared to continued treatment with the 80 mg/ 12.5 mg combination of 2.7/ 1.6 mm Hg (SBP/ DBP) was demonstrated (difference in adjusted mean changes from baseline).
In a pooled analysis of two similar 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials vs. valsartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/ 25 mg (n=2121 patients evaluated for efficacy) a significantly greater blood pressure lowering effect of 2.2/ 1.2 mm Hg (SBP/ DBP) was demonstrated (difference in adjusted mean changes from baseline, respectively) in favour of telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/ 25 mg combination.
39 Toxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury.

The most common side effects with Kepivance (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are taste perversion (altered taste), mouth/ tongue thickness or discolouration, rash, pruritus (itching), erythema (redness), arthralgia (joint pain), oedema (fluid retention), pain and fever.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Kepivance’ s benefits are greater than its risks when used to decrease the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis in patients with haematological malignancies receiving myeloablative therapy associated with a high incidence of severe mucositis and requiring autologous stem cell support.
Efficacy and safety of palifermin were established in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients received high-dose cytotoxic therapy consisting of fractionated total-body irradiation (12 Gy total dose), high-dose etoposide (60 mg/ kg), and high-dose cyclophosphamide (100 mg/ kg) followed by PBPC support for the treatment of haematological malignancies ((Non- Hodgkin’ s Lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin’ s disease, Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), or multiple myeloma).
After single intravenous doses of 20 to 250 micrograms/ kg (healthy volunteers) and 60 micrograms/ kg (cancer patients), palifermin exhibited rapid extravascular distribution In patients with haematological malignancies mean Vss was 5 l/ kg and mean clearance about 1300 ml/ hour/ kg with an average terminal half-life of approximately 4.5 hours.
Kepivance is used to reduce the frequency, duration and severity of oral mucositis (soreness, dryness and inflammation of the mouth) and improve related symptoms in patients with haematological malignancies (blood cancers) receiving certain types of chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy requiring autologous haematopoietic stem cell support (cells from your own body that produce blood).
Very common (more than 1 in every 10 patients) side effects are: • skin rash, itching and redness (pruritus and erythaema); • an increase in the thickness in the mouth or tongue; • change in colour of the mouth or tongue; • generalised swelling (oedema); • pain; • fever; • aching joints (arthralgia); and • altered taste.
Caution should be exercised in prescribing and infusing IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, severely hypovolemic patients, and patients with diseases which increase blood viscosity).
Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 1.1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
Certain adverse reactions may occur more frequently: • in case of high rate of infusion. • if you have hypo- or agammaglobulinaemia (a condition implying low immunoglobulin levels in your blood) with or without IgA deficiency. • if you are having Flebogammadif for the first time, or it is a long time since your last infusion (e. g. several weeks).
Rare side effects, which are likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients, are: • A sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock, even if you have shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration. • Cases of temporary meningitis (reversible aseptic meningitis). • Cases of temporary reduction in the number of the red cells in the blood (reversible haemolytic anaemia/ haemolysis). • Cases of transient cutaneous reactions. • Increase in serum creatinine level and/ or acute renal failure.
Flebogammadif should not be used in people who may be allergic to normal human immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are allergic to other types of immunoglobulin, especially where they have deficiency (very low levels) of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and they have antibodies against IgA.
Gardasil is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1).

HPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers; 80% of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); 45-70% of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3); 25% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1); approximately 70% of HPV related high- grade vulvar (VIN 2/ 3) and vaginal (VaIN 2/ 3) intraepithelial neoplasia.
The term "premalignant genital lesions" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/ 3) and high- grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/ 3).
The primary efficacy endpoints included HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related vulvar and vaginal lesions (genital warts, VIN, VaIN) and CIN of any grade (Protocol 013, FUTURE I), HPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/ 3 and AIS (Protocol 015, FUTURE II), HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection (Protocol 007), and HPV 16-related persistent infection (Protocol 005).
The primary analyses of efficacy, with respect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18), were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population (n= all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment, no major protocol deviations and naïve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)).
In the second CIN 3 case observed in a patient infected with HPV 51 at Day 1 (in 2 of 9 specimens); HPV 16 was detected at a Month 51 biopsy (in 1 of 9 specimens) and HPV 56 was detected in 3 of 9 specimens at Month 52 in tissue excised during LEEP. ***Patients were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.6 years) Note:
In the HPV naïve population (naïve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1), Gardasil reduced the proportion of women who experienced, a definitive cervical therapy procedure (Loop Electro-Excision Procedure or Cold-Knife Conization) by 41.9% (95% CI:
Cross-protective efficacy The efficacy of Gardasil against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/ 3 or AIS caused by 10 non-vaccine HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) structurally related to HPV 16 or HPV 18 was evaluated in the combined Phase III efficacy database (N = 17,599) after a median follow-up of 3.7 years (at end of study).
The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types. ‡ Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS § Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-, 33-, 52-, and 58-related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS ║ Includes assay-identified non-vaccine HPV types 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59.
The immunogenicity of Gardasil was assessed in 8,915 (Gardasil n = 4,666; placebo n = 4,249) women 18 to 26 years of age and 3,400 female (Gardasil n = 1,471; placebo n = 583) and male (Gardasil n = 1,071; placebo n = 275) adolescents 9 to 17 years of age.
In the clinical studies, 99.9%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.6% of individuals who received Gardasil became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18-seropositive respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3 across all age groups tested.

The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types. ‡ Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS § Efficacy was based on reductions in HPV 31-, 33-, 52-, and 58-related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS ║ Includes assay-identified non-vaccine HPV types 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59.
The immunogenicity of Gardasil was assessed in 8,915 (Gardasil n = 4,666; placebo n = 4,249) women 18 to 26 years of age and 3,400 female (Gardasil n = 1,471; placebo n = 583) and male (Gardasil n = 1,071; placebo n = 275) adolescents 9 to 17 years of age.
In the clinical studies, 99.9%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.6% of individuals who received Gardasil became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18-seropositive respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3 across all age groups tested.

Gardasil is used to vaccinate against precancerous lesions (abnormal cell growth) in the genital area (cervix, vulva or vagina), cancer of the cervix and genital warts that are caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 or 18.
Looking at the results of all four studies together, in women who had never been infected by HPV types 6, 11, 16 or 18 before, and who received the full course of vaccination, one woman out of over 8,000 vaccinated with Gardasil developed a precancerous lesion in the cervix that might have been due to HPV type 16 or 18.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Gardasil’ s benefits are greater than its risks as a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.

The most common side effects with Raptiva (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are mild to moderate flu-like symptoms including headache, fever, chills, nausea (feeling sick), myalgia (muscle pain), and leucocytosis and lymphocytosis (increased white blood cell counts).
Therefore, the Committee decided that Raptiva’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who have failed to respond to, or who have a contra-indication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including ciclosporin, methotrexate and PUVA.
Analysis following long-term use in a cohort of 339 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving Raptiva 1 mg/ kg/ week, of which 166 patients have been treated for more than 2 years and up to 3 years, did not show any noteworthy differences in frequency of adverse events as compared to 12 weeks of exposure to Raptiva.
Pharmacodynamic effects In studies using an initial dose of 0.7 mg/ kg followed by 11 weekly doses of 1.0 mg/ kg, efalizumab maximally reduced expression of CD11a on circulating T lymphocytes to approximately 15-30% of pre-dose baseline values and saturated CD11a to < 5% of baseline available CD11a binding sites.
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects who achieved a rating of Minimal or Clear on a static global assessment by the physician, the Overall Lesion Severity (OLS), the proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% improvement in 9 PASI score (a PASI 50 response) relative to baseline after 12 weeks of treatment, the time-course of mean PASI percentage improvement from baseline, improvement in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Psoriasis Symptom Assessment (PSA), the Physician’ s Global Assessment (PGA) of change, change in the PASI thickness component, and change in the body surface area affected.
It is important that your hands and items you use be as clean as possible. • Take the Raptiva out of the refrigerator and lay out on a clean surface everything you need: o one vial containing the Raptiva powder o one pre-filled syringe containing the solvent o one EasyMIX adapter for reconstitution o two alcohol swabs o one needle for subcutaneous injection, and o a sharps container
You should not touch this area. • Holding the EasyMIX outer cover, place it on top of the vial, then press down so that the plastic spiked end pierces the rubber stopper on the vial. • Ensure the EasyMIX adapter is firmly attached to the vial, before removing the outer cover.
What Raptiva contains • The active substance is efalizumab, each vial contains a deliverable dose of 125 mg efalizumab. • The other ingredients are polysorbate 20, histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate and sucrose. • Each pre-filled syringe of solvent contains sufficient water for injections to make up the solution for injection.
The product is supplied in packs of 1 vial of powder, 1 pre-filled syringe of solvent, 1 EasyMIX adapter for reconstitution, 1 needle for injection; in packs of 4 vials of powder, 4 pre-filled syringes of solvent, 4 EasyMIX adapters for reconstitution, 4 needles for injection and in packs of 12 vials of powder, 12 pre-filled syringes of solvent, 12 EasyMIX adapters for reconstitution and 12 needles for injection.
Thyrogen (thyrotropin alfa) is indicated for pre-therapeutic stimulation in low risk (see section 5.1) post-thyroidectomy patients maintained on hormone suppression therapy (THST) for the ablation of thyroid remnant tissue (in combination) with 100 mCi (3.7 GBq) radioactive iodine (131I).
In clinical trials, for the detection of thyroid remnants or cancer in ablated patients using a thyroglobulin assay with a lower limit of detection of 0.5 ng/ ml, Thyrogen-stimulated thyroglobulin levels of 3 ng/ ml, 2 ng/ ml and 1 ng/ ml corresponded with thyroglobulin levels after withdrawal of thyroid hormone of 10 ng/ ml, 5 ng/ ml and 2 ng/ ml, respectively.

The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Thyrogen’ s benefits are greater than its risks for use in post-thyroidectomy patients maintained on hormone suppression therapy (THST) for the detection of thyroid remnants and well-differentiated thyroid cancer (with serum thyroglobulin testing with or without radioiodine imaging) and for the ablation of thyroid remnant tissue in combination with radioactive iodine (131I).
Panretin is used when: • the lesions are not ulcerated or lymphoedematous (the skin has not broken and the lesions are not swollen with fluid), and • they have not responded to the antiretroviral treatment the patient is already receiving, and • radiotherapy or chemotherapy is not appropriate, and • the patient does not need treatment for visceral (internal) Kaposi’ s sarcoma.

The most common side effect with Panretin (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are rash (redness, scaling, inflammation), pruritus (itching), skin disorders (cracking, scabbing, crusting, draining, oozing) and pain (burning, soreness).
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable 9-cis- retinoic acid plasma concentrations in patients with KS after application of the medicinal product were comparable to the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable plasma concentrations of circulating, naturally-occurring 9-cis-retinoic acid in untreated individuals (see section 5.2).
It is unlikely that the undesirable systemic side effects associated with oral retinoids will be observed with the use of Panretin gel because the range and frequency of quantifiable 9-cis-retinoic acid plasma levels concentrations after application of the medicinal product were comparable to the range and frequency of quantifiable plasma concentrations of circulating, naturally occurring 9-cis-retinoic acid in untreated individuals.
Alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid), a naturally- occurring endogenous hormone related to vitamin A, binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RARα, RARβ, RARγ, RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ).
In this latter group, the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable 9-cis-retinoic acid plasma concentrations in patients with KS after application of the medicinal product were comparable to the range and frequency of detection of quantifiable plasma concentrations of circulating, naturally-occurring 9-cis- retinoic acid in untreated individuals.
Panretin is used in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’ s sarcoma (KS) and is for the treatment of the KS lesions: that are on the skin only; which have not responded to your HIV treatment; where the skin or lesion is not broken; where the surrounding skin is not swollen; or if your doctor thinks that other treatments are not suitable for you.
• Do not be discouraged if you do not see immediate improvement. • It may take up to 12 weeks for any improvement to show. • Do not stop treatment at the first sign of improvement. • You may need to reduce the number of daily applications, or stop using Panretin for a short while, if you develop unwanted skin effects.
Co-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Noxafil should be administered with caution to patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as: • Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation • Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure • Sinus bradycardia • Existing symptomatic arrhythmias • Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those mentioned in section 4.3).
Therefore, inhibitors (e. g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e. g. rifampicin, rifabutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, respectively.
The effect of other H2 receptor antagonists (e. g. famotidine, ranitidine) and proton pump inhibitors (e. g. omeprazole) that may suppress gastric acidity for several hours on plasma levels of posaconazole has not been studied but a reduction in bioavailability may occur so that co- administration should be avoided if possible.
Following co-administration of oral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26- fold), respectively.
Following co-administration of oral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir and ritonavir (300/ 100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively.
In another study in healthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of oral posaconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of IV midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average of 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days increased the IV midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to 7.6-fold), respectively.

Clinical experience Invasive aspergillosis Oral posaconazole 800 mg/ day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal formulations) or itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a non-comparative salvage therapy trial.
Study 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg twice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.
Effect of food on oral absorption in healthy volunteers The AUC of posaconazole is about 2.6 times greater when administered with a non-fat meal or nutritional supplement (14 grams fat) and 4 times greater when administered with a high-fat meal (~ 50 grams fat) relative to the fasted state.
Hepatic impairment In a study with small number of subjects (n=12) who had hepatic impairment, there was an increase in exposure associated with prolongation of half-life in hepatic impaired patients (26.6, 35.3, and 46.1 hours for the mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively compared to 22.1 hours in subjects with normal hepatic function).

In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator.
Competact combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone.

In epilepsy, Lyrica was effective in reducing the number of seizures: the percentage of patients treated with Lyrica who had a 50% or more improvement in their monthly seizure was about 45% when they received 600 mg/ day, and about 35% when they received 300 mg a day, compared to about 10% of patients treated with placebo.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Lyrica’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, as therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation, and for the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder in adults.

In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i. e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of PegIntron subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.

Ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
PegIntron PegIntron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’- oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
15 following combination regimens: • Peg Intron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.
Peg Intron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) p< 0.001 P 1.5 vs.

In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).

MIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. a: p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. b: p value based on chi-square test. c: subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week PegIntron and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week PegIntron. d: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.
PegIntron/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Following multiple dosing of PegIntron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of PegIntron is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from PegIntron by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).

In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
PegIntron PegIntron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’- oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
38 In the PegIntron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.
PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) p < 0.001 P 1.5 vs.

In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).

PegIntron/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Following multiple dosing of PegIntron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of PegIntron is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from PegIntron by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of PegIntron subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).

A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving Peg Intron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
Peg Intron PegIntron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’- oligoadenylate syn thetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
130 In the PegIntron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.
PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) p < 0.001 P 1.5 vs.
PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)
In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-u p period of 6 months.
Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800- 1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).

PegIntron/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Following multiple dosing of PegIntron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of PegIntron is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from PegIntron by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
Each pre-filled pen of PegIntron 80 micrograms contains a sufficient amount of peginterferon alfa-2b as measured on a protein basis in a powder for solution for injection, and the corresponding amount of solvent, to provide 80 micrograms in 0.5 ml of peginterferon alfa-2b when reconstituted as recommended.
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of PegIntron subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.

In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of PegIntron subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.
Acute hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic reactions including anaphylactic shock, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, arthritis rheumatoid and arthritis rheumatoid aggravated
Ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
Peg Intron PegIntron pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’- oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
222 In the PegIntron combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.
PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) p < 0.001 P 1.5 vs.
PegIntron (1.5 micrograms/kg) + ribavirin (800 mg) PegIntron (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg) Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg)
In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Patients were randomized to receive either PegIntron (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).
Sustained virological response based on genotype after PegIntron in combination with Ribavirin in HCV/HIV Co-infected patients Study 11 Study 22 PegIntron Interferon PegIntron Interferon (100 or alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/ alfa-2b 150c µg/week) (3 MIU TIW) week) + (3 MIU TIW) + + ribavirin + ribavirin
MIU = million international units; TIW = three times a week. a: p value based on Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi square test. b: p value based on chi-square test. c: subjects < 75 kg received 100 µg/week PegIntron and subjects ≥ 75 kg received 150 µg/week PegIntron. d: ribavirin dosing was 800 mg for patients < 60 kg, 1,000 mg for patients 60-75 kg, and 1,200 mg for patients > 75 kg.
PegIntron/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with PegIntron, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Following multiple dosing of PegIntron (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of PegIntron is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.

An additional two studies have looked at the use of PegIntron in combination with ribavirin in 565 patients also infected with HIV, and a further study looked at the use of this combination in 1,354 patients whose previous treatment including interferon alfa (pegylated or non-pegylated) did not work or whose disease had come back after previous treatment.
Combining ribavirin and PegIntron (as a once-weekly injection of 1.5 micrograms/ kg) was more effective than the combination with interferon alfa-2b (3 million IU three times a week): more patients had responded to treatment at the end of the study (65% compared with 54%).
The most common side effects with PegIntron (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are viral infection, weight loss, depression, irritability, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), anxiety, impaired concentration, emotional lability (mood swings), headache, dry mouth, dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), pharyngitis (sore throat), coughing, vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, anorexia (loss of appetite), alopecia (hair loss), pruritus (itching), dry skin, rash, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), musculoskeletal pain (pain in the muscles and bones), inflammation at the site of the injection, injection site reaction (pain and redness), dizziness, fatigue (tiredness), rigors (shaking chills), fever, flu-like symptoms and asthenia (weakness).
PegIntron should not be used in: • patients with a history of severe heart disease, • patients with severe medical conditions, • patients with an auto-immune disease (when the body attacks itself), • patients with severe liver problems, • patients with thyroid disease unless it is controlled, • patients with epilepsy or other central nervous system problems, • HIV-infected patients with signs of serious liver disease.
As with all other NRTIs, Emtriva may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Emtriva during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
Caution should be exercised when emtricitabine is co-administered with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular secretion as such co-administration may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either emtricitabine or a co-administered medicinal product, due to competition for this elimination pathway (see section 4.5).
In virologically stable treatment-experienced adults, emtricitabine, in combination with an NRTI (either stavudine or zidovudine) and a protease inhibitor (PI) or an NNRTI was shown to be non-inferior to lamivudine with respect to the proportion of responders (< 400 copies/ ml) through 48 weeks (77% emtricitabine, 82% lamivudine).
At 48 weeks of treatment the emtricitabine-containing regimen demonstrated an equivalent proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ ml (94% emtricitabine versus 92%) and a greater proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml (95% emtricitabine versus 87%) compared with the patients continuing with their PI-HAART regimen.
In 20 HIV infected subjects receiving 200 mg emtricitabine daily as hard capsules, steady-state plasma emtricitabine peak concentrations (Cmax), trough concentrations (Cmin) and area under the plasma concentration time curve over a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) were 1.8±0.7 µg/ ml, 0.09±0.07 µg/ ml and 10.0±3.1 µg·h/ ml, respectively.
Administration of Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules with a high-fat meal or administration of Emtriva 10 mg/ ml oral solution with a low-fat or high-fat meal did not affect systemic exposure (AUC0-∞) of emtricitabine; therefore Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules and Emtriva 10 mg/ ml oral solution may be administered with or without food.
Subjects were grouped according to baseline creatinine clearance (> 80 ml/ min as normal function; 50-80 ml/ min as mild impairment; 30-49 ml/ min as moderate impairment; < 30 ml/ min as severe impairment; < 15 ml/ min as functionally anephric requiring haemodialysis).
The systemic emtricitabine exposure (mean ± standard deviation) increased from 11.8±2.9 µg·h/ ml in subjects with normal renal function to 19.9±1.1, 25.0±5.7 and 34.0±2.1 µg·h/ ml, in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.
In patients with ESRD on haemodialysis, approximately 30% of the emtricitabine dose was recovered in dialysate over a 3 hour dialysis period which had been started within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing (blood flow rate of 400 ml/ min and dialysate flow rate of approximately 600 ml/ min).
10 The mean AUC in 77 infants, children and adolescents receiving 6 mg/ kg emtricitabine once daily as oral solution or 200 mg emtricitabine as hard capsules once daily was similar to the mean AUC of 10.0 µg·h/ ml in 20 adults receiving 200 mg hard capsules once daily.
Due to a difference in the bioavailability of emtricitabine between the hard capsule and oral solution presentations, 240 mg emtricitabine administered as the oral solution (24 ml) should provide similar plasma levels to those observed after administration of one 200 mg emtricitabine hard capsule (see section 5.2).
Caution should be exercised when emtricitabine is co-administered with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular secretion as such co-administration may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either emtricitabine or a co-administered medicinal product, due to competition for this elimination pathway (see section 4.5).
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump) (see section 4.4).
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (zidovudine, stavudine, tenofovir, abacavir, didanosine and zalcitabine), all non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and all protease inhibitors (PIs).
In virologically stable treatment-experienced adults, emtricitabine, in combination with an NRTI (either stavudine or zidovudine) and a protease inhibitor (PI) or an NNRTI was shown to be non-inferior to lamivudine with respect to the proportion of responders (< 400 copies/ ml) through 48 weeks (77% emtricitabine, 82% lamivudine).
At 48 weeks of treatment the emtricitabine-containing regimen demonstrated an equivalent proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ ml (94% emtricitabine versus 92%) and a greater proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml (95% emtricitabine versus 87%) compared with the patients continuing with their PI-HAART regimen.
In 20 HIV infected subjects receiving 200 mg emtricitabine daily as hard capsules, steady-state plasma emtricitabine peak concentrations (Cmax), trough concentrations (Cmin) and area under the plasma concentration time curve over a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) were 1.8±0.7 µg/ ml, 0.09±0.07 µg/ ml and 10.0±3.1 µg·h/ ml, respectively.
Administration of Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules with a high-fat meal or administration of Emtriva 10 mg/ ml oral solution with a low-fat or high-fat meal did not affect systemic exposure (AUC0-∞) of emtricitabine; therefore Emtriva 200 mg hard capsules and Emtriva 10 mg/ ml oral solution may be administered with or without food.
Subjects were grouped according to baseline creatinine clearance (> 80 ml/ min as normal function; 50-80 ml/ min as mild impairment; 30-49 ml/ min as moderate impairment; < 30 ml/ min as severe impairment; < 15 ml/ min as functionally anephric requiring haemodialysis).
The systemic emtricitabine exposure (mean ± standard deviation) increased from 11.8±2.9 µg·h/ ml in subjects with normal renal function to 19.9±1.1, 25.0±5.7 and 34.0±2.1 µg·h/ ml, in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.
The mean AUC in 77 infants, children and adolescents receiving 6 mg/ kg emtricitabine once daily as oral solution or 200 mg emtricitabine as hard capsules once daily was similar to the mean AUC of 10.0 µg·h/ ml in 20 adults receiving 200 mg hard capsules once daily.

• Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV season. • Children less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the last 6 months. • Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
In the phase III IMpact-RSV study in the premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the proportions of patients in the placebo and palivizumab groups who received routine childhood vaccines, influenza vaccine, bronchodilators or corticosteroids were similar and no incremental increase in adverse reactions was observed among patients receiving these agents.
Adverse events at least possibly causally-related to palivizumab, both clinical and laboratory, are displayed by system organ class and frequency (common ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) in studies conducted in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric patients, and congenital heart disease patients (Tables 1 and 2, respectively).
No medically important differences were observed during the prophylactic studies carried out in the premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations in ADRs by body system or when evaluated in subgroups of children by clinical category, gender, age, gestational age, country, race/ ethnicity or quartile serum palivizumab concentration.
Clinical studies In a placebo-controlled trial of RSV disease prophylaxis in (IMpact-RSV trial) 1502 high-risk children (1002 Synagis; 500 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/ kg reduced the incidence of RSV related hospitalisation by 55% (p = < 0.001).
In a placebo-controlled trial in 1287 patients ≤ 24 months of age with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (639 Synagis; 648 placebo), 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/ kg Synagis reduced the incidence of RSV hospitalisations by 45% (p = 0.003) (congenital heart disease study).
In prophylactic studies in premature and bronchopulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the mean half-life of palivizumab was 20 days and monthly intramuscular doses of 15 mg/ kg achieved mean 30 day trough serum active substance concentrations of approximately 40 μ g/ ml after the first injection, approximately 60 μ g/ ml after the second injection, approximately 70 μ g/ ml after the third injection and fourth injection.
Among 139 children in the congenital heart disease study receiving palivizumab who had cardio-pulmonary bypass and for whom paired serum samples were available, the mean serum palivizumab concentration was approximately 100 μ g/ ml pre-cardiac bypass and declined to approximately 40 μ g/ ml after bypass.

In addition, more than 1 patient in 100 with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease have the following side effects: hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels), orthostatic dizziness (dizziness when standing up), orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up) and musculoskeletal (joint) pain.
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure.
3 As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see section 5.1).
Diuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics.
Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i. e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease: in addition to the adverse drug reactions mentioned under hypertension, in diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i. e., uncommon) but in excess of placebo.
Paediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%).
In patients not adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/ 3-6 mm Hg (systolic/ diastolic).
Reduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/ kg (low), 1.5 mg/ kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/ kg (high) target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of hypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period.
Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).
In 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria ≥ 900 mg/ day and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/ dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined.
Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (e. g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of ≤ 135/ 85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg.
Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)].
As for the secondary endpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups in the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo- based regimen.
While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/ kg/ day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion.

Reduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/ kg (low), 1.5 mg/ kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/ kg (high) target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of hypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period.
Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).
In 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria ≥ 900 mg/ day and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/ dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan BMS on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined.
Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (e. g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of ≤ 135/ 85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg.
Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)].
As for the secondary endpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups in the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo- based regimen.
While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/ kg/ day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion.
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure.
33 As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see section 5.1).
Diuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan BMS has been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics.
Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i. e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (see section 5.3).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease: in addition to the adverse drug reactions mentioned under hypertension, in diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i. e., uncommon) but in excess of placebo.

In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease, dizziness when getting up from a lying or sitting position, low blood pressure when getting up from a lying or sitting position, pain in joints or muscles and decreased levels of a protein in the red blood cells (haemoglobin) were also reported.

Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).
3 Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening undesirable effects [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Renal insufficiency: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2).
Contraindications of concomitant use Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3).
Other interactions Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “ q8h” or “ q12h”).

AUC: ↓ 60% (↓ 52 to ↓ 68) Cmax: ↓ 62% (↓ 55 to ↓ 78) (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values.
AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/ or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%).
The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks).
Analysis of long-term data from study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.
Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000) including isolated reports.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Liver enzymes: elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-term treatment in study 006).
Elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5-2% of patients treated with control regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term treatment).
In the long-term data set from study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/ or C (hepatitis C antibody positive).
Among these co-infected patients, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of those in the control arm, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of the patients in the control arm.
Postmarketing experience with efavirenz has shown the following additional adverse reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens: cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, delusion, hepatic failure, neurosis, photoallergic dermatitis, psychosis and completed suicide.
Antiviral activity: the free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/ monocyte cultures.
The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold resistance).
Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/ or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients.
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry.
In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who terminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/ ml at the missing time points.
NC = F, noncompleter = failure. b EFV, efavirenz; ZDV, zidovudine; 3TC, lamivudine; IDV, indinavir; NRTI, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; NFV, nelfinavir. c C. I., confidence interval for proportion of patients in response. d S. E. M., standard error of the mean. ---, not performed.
ACTG 382 is an ongoing uncontrolled study of 57 NRTI-experienced paediatric patients (3 - 16 years) which characterises the pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity and safety of efavirenz in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/ kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs.
22 Effect of food: the bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz hard capsules in uninfected volunteers was increased 22% and 17%, respectively, when given with a meal of high fat or normal composition, relative to the bioavailability of a 600 mg dose given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4).
Bioavailability of hard capsule contents mixed with food vehicles: in healthy adult subjects, the efavirenz AUC when administered as the contents of three 200 mg hard capsules mixed with 2 teaspoons of certain food vehicles (applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt or infant formula) met bioequivalency criteria for the AUC of the intact capsule formulation administered under fasted conditions.
Paediatric pharmacokinetics: in 49 paediatric patients receiving the equivalent of a 600 mg dose of efavirenz (dose adjusted from calculated body size based on weight), steady state Cmax was 14.1 μ M, steady state Cmin was 5.6 μ M, and AUC was 216 μ M·h.
Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).
27 Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening undesirable effects [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Renal insufficiency: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2).
Contraindications of concomitant use Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3).
Other interactions Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “ q8h” or “ q12h”).

AUC: ↓ 60% (↓ 52 to ↓ 68) Cmax: ↓ 62% (↓ 55 to ↓ 78) (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values.
AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/ or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%).
The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks).
Analysis of long-term data from study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.
Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000) including isolated reports.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Liver enzymes: elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-term treatment in study 006).
Elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5-2% of patients treated with control regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term treatment).
In the long-term data set from study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/ or C (hepatitis C antibody positive).
Among these co-infected patients, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of those in the control arm, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of the patients in the control arm.
Postmarketing experience with efavirenz has shown the following additional adverse reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens: cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, delusion, hepatic failure, neurosis, photoallergic dermatitis, psychosis and completed suicide.
Antiviral activity: the free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/ monocyte cultures.
The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold resistance).
Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/ or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients.
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry.
In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who terminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/ ml at the missing time points.

ACTG 382 is an ongoing uncontrolled study of 57 NRTI-experienced paediatric patients (3 - 16 years) which characterises the pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity and safety of efavirenz in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/ kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs.
46 Effect of food: the bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz hard capsules in uninfected volunteers was increased 22% and 17%, respectively, when given with a meal of high fat or normal composition, relative to the bioavailability of a 600 mg dose given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4).
Bioavailability of hard capsule contents mixed with food vehicles: in healthy adult subjects, the efavirenz AUC when administered as the contents of three 200 mg hard capsules mixed with 2 teaspoons of certain food vehicles (applesauce, grape jelly, yogurt or infant formula) met bioequivalency criteria for the AUC of the intact capsule formulation administered under fasted conditions.

In 17 paediatric patients receiving an investigational oral solution similar to the commercial formulation adjusted on the basis of body size to be equivalent to an adult 600 mg capsule dose, the steady-state Cmax was 11.8 μ M, steady state Cmin was 5.2 μ M, and AUC was 188 μ M·h.
Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).
Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening undesirable effects [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).
Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Renal insufficiency: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2).
Contraindications of concomitant use Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3).
Other interactions Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “ q8h” or “ q12h”).

AUC: ↓ 60% (↓ 52 to ↓ 68) Cmax: ↓ 62% (↓ 55 to ↓ 78) (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values.
AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/ or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%).
Analysis of long-term data from study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.
Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000) including isolated reports.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Liver enzymes: elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-term treatment in study 006).
Elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5-2% of patients treated with control regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term treatment).
In the long-term data set from study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/ or C (hepatitis C antibody positive).
Among these co-infected patients, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of those in the control arm, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of the patients in the control arm.
Postmarketing experience with efavirenz has shown the following additional adverse reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens: cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, delusion, hepatic failure, neurosis, photoallergic dermatitis, psychosis and completed suicide.
Antiviral activity: the free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/ monocyte cultures.
The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold resistance).
Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/ or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients.
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry.
Long-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with EFV+IDV, 196 patients with EFV+ZDV+3TC and 127 patients with IDV+ZDV+3TC, respectively), suggest durability of response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ ml, HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.

Sustiva has been studied in three main studies involving over 1,100 adults:  in the first study, Sustiva in combination with lamivudine and zidovudine or with indinavir (other antiviral medicines) was compared with the combination of indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine;  the second study compared Sustiva in combination with nelfinavir and two other antiviral medicines with the same combination without Sustiva;  the third study compared adding Sustiva or placebo (a dummy treatment) to a combination of antiviral medicines that included indinavir and two other antiviral medicines, in patients who had already been receiving treatment for HIV infection.
All of the studies showed that combinations including Sustiva were at least as effective as the comparator medicines:  the first study showed that 67% of the adults treated with Sustiva in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine had viral loads below 400 copies/ ml after 48 weeks, compared with 54% of the patients treated with Sustiva and indinavir, and 45% of the patients treated with indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine;  in the second study, Sustiva in combination with nelfinavir was superior to the combination without Sustiva:
Sustiva is also associated with nervous system symptoms, such as dizziness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), somnolence (sleepiness), impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming, and with psychiatric disorders, including severe depression, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and aggressive behaviour, especially in patients with a history of mental illness.
It must not be used in patients with severe liver disease or who are taking any of the following medicines:  astemizole, terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms - these medicines may be available without prescription);  dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to treat migraine headache);  midazolam, triazolam (used to relieve anxiety or difficulty sleeping);  pimozide (used to treat mental illnesses);  cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems);  bepridil (used to treat angina);  St John ’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression).

When changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen with Optisulin, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the concomitant antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of additional regular insulins or fast- acting insulin analogues or the dose of oral antidiabetic agents).
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e. g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline) thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e. g. clozapine and olanzapine) and protease inhibitors.

Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with
QT interval In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.
However, as with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).
Adults The most frequently (seen in ≥ 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, cholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, dizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue and oedema.
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/ l) which increased to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.016 mmol/ l - 10 < 1.467 mmol/ l) to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l).
In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) for serotonin 5 HT2A/ 2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5; α 1 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors.
In a multinational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms (baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p= 0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1).
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p = 0.055).
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence, defined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria.

Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with
QT interval In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.
However, as with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).
Adults The most frequently (seen in ≥ 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, cholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, dizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue and oedema.

Additionally, Rebetol is indicated, in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C, not previously treated, without liver decompensation, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), who are positive for serum HCV-RNA, including patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection (see section 4.4).
Additionally, Rebetol is indicated, in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i. e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
During those clinical trials in which patients were treated for one year, patients who failed to show a virological response after six months of treatment (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection) were unlikely to become sustained virological responders (HCV-RNA below lower limit of detection six months after withdrawal of treatment). • Genotype 1:
A decrease in haemoglobin levels to < 10 g/ dl was observed in up to 14% of adult patients and 7% of children and adolescents treated with Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b (adults only) or interferon alfa-2b (adults and children or adolescents) in clinical trials.
Although data on approximately 300 prospectively followed pregnancies with paternal exposure to ribavirin have not shown an increased risk of malformation compared to the general population, nor any specific pattern of malformation, male patients and their female partners of childbearing age must be counseled to each use an effective contraceptive during treatment with Rebetol and for seven months after treatment Men whose partners are pregnant must be instructed to use a condom to minimise delivery of ribavirin to the partner.
10 The safety of Rebetol capsules is evaluated from data from three clinical trials in patients with no previous exposure to interferon (interferon-naïve patients): two trials studied Rebetol in combination with interferon alfa-2b, one trial studied Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b.
Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known.

* Since ribavirin is always prescribed with an alpha interferon product, and the listed adverse drug reactions included reflecting post-marketing experience do not allow precise quantification of frequency, the frequency reported above is from clinical trials using ribavirin in combination with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated or nonpegylated).
For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%),
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving Rebetol in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b.
In general, the adverse event profile in the limited paediatric population studied was similar to that observed in adults, although there is a paediatric-specific concern regarding growth inhibition, as decrease in height (mean percentile decrease of growth velocity of 9%) and weight (mean percentile decrease of 13%) percentile were observed during treatment (see section 4.4).

In clinical trials with Rebetol used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b or interferon alfa-2b, the maximum overdose reported was a total dose of 10 g of Rebetol (50 x 200 mg capsules) and 39 MIU of interferon alfa-2b (13 subcutaneous injections of 3 MIU each) taken in one day by a patient in an attempt at suicide.
In clinical trial C/I98-580, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • Rebetol (800 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) (n = 511). • Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) (n = 514). • Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg/day) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) (n = 505).
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg Rebetol (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg Rebetol (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg Rebetol were even higher.
Rebetol (800 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg) Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg) + peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 to 0.5 microgram/kg) Rebetol (1,000/1,200 mg) + interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU)
In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received peginterferon alfa-2b, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Patients were randomized to receive either Rebetol (800 mg/day) plus peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 µg/kg/week) or Rebetol (800 mg/day) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months.
Patients were randomized to receive either Rebetol (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) plus peginterferon alfa-2b (100 or 150 µg/week based on weight) or Rebetol (800- 1,200 mg/day based on weight) plus interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW).

Previous treatment failure patients Retreatment of prior treatment failures (relapse and non-responder patients) with peginterferon alfa- 2b in combination with Rebetol In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with peginterferon alfa 2b, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted Rebetol.
Retreatment of relapse patients with Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment Two trials examined the use of Rebetol and interferon alfa-2b combination treatment in relapse patients (C95-144 and I95-145); 345 chronic hepatitis patients who had relapsed after previous interferon treatment were treated for six months with a six month follow-up.
Children and adolescents 3 to 16 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV-RNA (assessed by a central laboratory using a research-based RT-PCR assay) were enrolled in two multicentre trials and received Rebetol 15 mg/kg per day plus interferon alfa-2b 3 MIU/m2 3 times a week for 1 year followed by 6 months follow-up after treatment.

The most common side effects with Rebetol used in combination with interferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2b (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are viral infections, pharyngitis (sore throat), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), neutropenia (low white blood cell counts), hypothryroidism (underactive thyroid gland), anorexia (loss of appetite), depression, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), emotional lability (mood swings), anxiety, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, impaired concentration, cough, dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal (tummy) pain, vomiting, alopecia (hair loss), pruritus (itching), dry skin, rash, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), musculoskeletal pain (pain in the muscles and bones), reactions at the site of the injection including inflammation, fatigue (tiredness), fever, rigors (shaking chills), flu-like symptoms, asthenia (weakness), malaise (feeling unwell), irritability, weight loss and decreased growth rate.
Rebetol should not be used in: • pregnant women, • women who are breast-feeding, • patients with severe heart disease, • patients with a severe medical condition, including kidney failure and severe liver disease. • patients with certain blood disorder that affect haemoglobin, • patients with a history of certain disorders of the immune system, or are taking medicine that suppress the immune system, • children and adolescents with a history of severe mental illness, particularly severe depression, suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts.
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Rebetol’ s benefits are greater than its risks for treatment of chronic hepatitis C, as part of a combination regimen with peginterferon alfa-2b (adults) including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection, or
The most common side effects with Foscan (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are pain at the injection site, at the site of the tumour or in the face, haemorrhage (bleeding), scarring, mouth necrosis (death of cells or tissue in the mouth), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), face oedema (swelling) and constipation.
Foscan must also not be used in patients who have an operation planned in the next 30 days, who have an eye disease that is likely to need examination using a ‘ slit lamp’ (an instrument used by eye specialists to look into the eye) in the next 30 days, or who are already being treated with another medicine that increases sensitivity to light.
 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  Porphyria or other diseases exacerbated by light.  Hypersensitivity to porphyrins.  Tumours known to be eroding into a major blood vessel in or adjacent to the illumination site.  A planned surgical procedure within the next 30 days.  Coexisting ophthalmic disease likely to require slit-lamp examination within the next 30 days.  Existing therapy with a photosensitizing agent.

Extavia is indicated for the treatment of • Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1). • Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and two or more relapses within the last two years. • Patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease, evidenced by relapses.
If the patient fails to respond, for example a steady progression in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) for 6 months occurs or treatment with at least 3 courses of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticosteroids during a one-year period is required despite Extavia therapy, treatment with Extavia should be stopped.
− Initiation of treatment in pregnancy (see section 4.6). − Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human albumin or to any of the excipients. − Patients with current severe depression and/ or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). − Patients with decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).
In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, including liver function tests (e. g. aspartate aminotransferase serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), alanine aminotransferase serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and gamma glutamyltransferase), are recommended prior to initiation and at regular intervals following introduction of Extavia therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.
In the different controlled clinical trials, between 23% and 41% of the patients developed serum interferon beta-1b neutralising activity confirmed by at least two consecutive positive titres; of these patients, between 43% and 55% converted to a stable antibody negative status (based on two consecutive negative titres) during the subsequent observational period of the respective study.
b) The following adverse event listing is based on reports from clinical trials (Table 1, adverse events and laboratory abnormalities) and from the post-marketing surveillance (Table 2, reporting rates based on spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports classified as very common ≥ 1/ 10, common ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10, uncommon ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100, rare ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000, very rare < 1/ 10,000) of Extavia use.
Laboratory abnormality Λ Significantly associated with Extavia treatment for patients with first event suggestive of MS, p < 0.05 * Significantly associated with Extavia treatment for RRMS, p < 0.05 ° Significantly associated with Extavia treatment for SPMS, p < 0.05 § Injection site reaction (various kinds) comprises all adverse events occurring at the injection site, i. e. the following terms: injection site haemorrhage, injection site hypersensitivity, injection site inflammation, injection site mass, injection site necrosis, injection site pain, injection site reaction, injection site oedema, and injection site atrophy & “ Flu-like symptom complex” denotes flu syndrome and/ or a combination of at least two adverse events from fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, sweating.
One of the two studies demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the time to disability progression (Hazard Ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (0.55, 0.86), p=0.0010, corresponding to a 31% risk reduction due to Extavia) and in the time to becoming wheelchair-bound (Hazard Ratio = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (0.44, 0.85), p=0.0036, corresponding to a 39% risk reduction due to Extavia) in patients who received Extavia.
Retrospective analyses in subgroups showed that a treatment effect on disability progression is most likely in patients with active disease before treatment commences (Hazard Ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval (0.59, 0.88), p=0.0011, corresponding to a 28% risk reduction due to Extavia in patients with relapses or pronounced EDSS progression, 8 million IU Extavia versus all placebo patients).
12 In the placebo-controlled phase, Extavia delayed the progression from the first clinical event to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful manner, corresponding to a risk reduction of 47% (Hazard Ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval (0.39, 0.73), p < 0.0001).
After 3 years, a pre-planned interim analysis showed EDSS progression (confirmed increase in EDSS of greater than or equal to 1.0 compared to baseline) occurred in 24% of the patients in the delayed treatment group compared to 16% in the immediate treatment group [Hazard Ratio = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (0.39, 0.92), p=0.022].
Significant effects were also obtained in patients with less disseminated and less active disease at the time of the first event, the risk in two years for progression to CDMS in patients with monofocal onset was 47% for placebo and 24% for Extavia, without gadolinium (Gd-) enhancement 41% and 20%, with less than 9 T2 lesions 39% and 18%.
Furthermore, for the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan.
Reconstitution To reconstitute lyophilised interferon beta-1b for injection, the pre-filled syringe with solvent should be used with a needle or a vial adapter to inject the 1.2 ml of the solvent (sodium chloride 5.4 mg/ ml (0.54%) solution for injection) into the Extavia vial.

Before using it, doctors need to exclude other causes for the symptoms. • who have MS of the type known as ‘ relapsing-remitting ’, when the patient has attacks (relapses) within periods with no symptoms (remissions), and with at least two relapses within the last two years. • who have secondary progressive MS (the type of MS that comes after relapsing-remitting MS), when their disease is active.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Extavia’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with a single demyelinating event, if it is severe enough to justify treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, patients with relapsing-remitting MS and patients with secondary progressive MS with active disease.
Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/ cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway (see section 5.1), sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its co-administration with nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated.
When prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether patients with certain underlying conditions could be adversely affected by sildenafil’ s mild to moderate vasodilatory effects, for example patients with hypotension, patients with fluid depletion, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction or autonomic dysfunction (see section 4.4).
In post-marketing experience with sildenafil for male erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, transient ischaemic attack, hypertension and hypotension have been reported in temporal association with the use of sildenafil.
Sildenafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie’ s disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia).
Co-administration of bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of CYP2C19) 125mg twice daily with sildenafil 80 mg three times a day (at steady state) concomitantly administered during 6 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 63% decrease of sildenafil AUC.
Co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg twice daily) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in sildenafil Cmax and a 1,000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC.
Co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg three times a day) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in sildenafil Cmax and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC.
CYP3A4 inhibitors of intermediate potency (e. g. clarithromycin, telithromycin and nefazodone) are expected to have an effect in between that of ritonavir and CYP3A4 inhibitors of medium potency (e. g. saquinavir/ erythromycin), a seven-fold increase in exposure is assumed.
In these study populations, mean additional reductions of supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 7/ 7 mmHg, 9/ 5 mmHg, and 8/ 4 mmHg, respectively, and mean additional reductions of standing blood pressure of 6/ 6 mmHg, 11/ 4 mmHg, and 4/ 5 mmHg, respectively were observed.
Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/ cGMP pathway (see section 5.1), sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its co-administration with nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).
7 In a placebo-controlled study of Revatio as an adjunct to intravenous epoprostenol in pulmonary arterial hypertension, a total of 134 patients were treated with Revatio (in a fixed titration starting from 20 mg, to 40 mg and then 80 mg, three times a day) and epoprostenol, and 131 patients were treated with placebo and epoprostenol.
Adverse reactions which occurred in > 1% of Revatio-treated patients and were more frequent (> 1% difference) on Revatio in the pivotal study or in the Revatio combined data set of both the placebo- controlled studies in pulmonary arterial hypertension, at doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg three times a day are listed in the table below by class and frequency grouping (very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000, < 1/ 100) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70% stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7% and 6% respectively compared to baseline.
In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n=9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (visual acuity, Amsler grid, colour discrimination simulated traffic light, Humphrey perimeter and photostress).
Most patients were WHO Functional Class II (107/ 277, 39%) or III (160/ 277, 58%) with a mean baseline 6 minute walking distance of 378 meters and 326 meters respectively; fewer patients were Class I (1/ 277, 0.4%) or IV (9/ 277, 3%) at baseline.

If you are taking medicines containing erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin (these are antibiotics used to treat certain bacterial infections), saquinavir (for HIV) or nefazodone (for mental depression), ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking Revatio, as your dose may need to be adjusted.
Other side effects reported commonly (seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) included: infection under the skin, flu-like symptoms, sinusitis, anaemia, fluid retention, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, migraine, tremor, pins and needles, burning sensation, reduced skin sensation, bleeding at the back of the eye, effects on vision, blurred vision and light sensitivity, effects on colour vision, eye irritation, bloodshot eyes / red eyes, vertigo, bronchitis, nosebleed, runny nose, cough, stuffy nose, stomach inflammation, gastroenteritis, heartburn, piles, abdominal distension, dry mouth, hair loss, redness of the skin, night sweats, muscle aches, back pain and increased body temperature.
How duloxetine works in SUI is not clear but it is thought that, by increasing the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline at the level of the nerves that control the muscle of the urethra (the tube that leads from the bladder to outside), duloxetine causes a stronger closure of the urethra during urine storage.

A meta-analysis of placebo- controlled clinical trials of antidepressants medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 years old Cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8).
Caution is advised if YENTREVE is co-administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).
Effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine Antacids and H2 antagonists: co-administration of YENTREVE with aluminium- and magnesium- containing antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.
2 Cases of orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of treatment 23 See section 4.4 4 Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4) 5 Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment discontinuation.
The efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of SUI was established in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with SUI; of these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo.
Female rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

Naglazyme only slightly improves the symptoms of MPS VI, but because this disease is severe and there are no other treatments for most patients with the disease, the CHMP decided that Naglazyme’ s benefits are greater than its risks for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS VI.
The company that makes Naglazyme will carry out studies to look at the long-term safety and effectiveness of Naglazyme in pregnant and breast-feeding women and in children under the age of five years, to see if they develop antibodies (proteins that are produced in the body in response to Naglazyme that could affect the response to treatment) and to look at the medicine’ s side effects.
The most common symptoms of these infusion reactions included fever, chills/ rigors, rash, and urticaria, although hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, retrosternal pain, abdominal pain, headache, malaise, respiratory stress, angioneurotic oedema and joint pain were also reported.
Abdominal pain, ear pain, pain, reddened eye, shortness of breath, chills, chest pain, sore throat, stomach pain, poor reflexes, cloudy eyes, swollen face, gastroenteritis, high blood pressure, malaise, nasal congestion, bulging belly button, fever, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting and joint pain.

To avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: • Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector clockwise • Hold Actraphane 30 InnoLet with the needle pointing upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (picture 1C). • Keeping the needle upwards, press the push-button and the dose selector returns to zero • A drop of insulin must appear at the needle tip.
You will hear clicks as the dose selector returns to zero • After the injection, the needle must remain under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the full dose has been delivered • Make sure not to block the dose selector while injecting, as the dose selector must be allowed to return to zero when you press the push-button • Remove the needle after each injection.

Xigris should not be used in patients with any current bleeding or risk of bleeding (see the Package Leaflet for the full list of restrictions), and doctors must be careful when using Xigris at the same time as other anticoagulant medicines (such as warfarin or high-dose heparin) – the full list is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics (also part of the EPAR).
• Active internal bleeding • Patients with intracranial pathology; neoplasm or evidence of cerebral herniation • Concurrent heparin therapy ≥ 15 International Units/ kg/ hr • Known bleeding diathesis except for acute coagulopathy related to sepsis • Chronic severe hepatic disease • Platelet count < 30,000 x 106/ l, even if the platelet count is increased after transfusions • Patients at increased risk for bleeding (for example):
history of severe head trauma that required hospitalization, intracranial or intraspinal surgery, or haemorrhagic stroke within the previous 3 months, or any history of intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral aneurysm, or central nervous system mass lesion; patients with an epidural catheter or who are anticipated to receive an epidural catheter during drug infusion
In each of two randomised, placebo-controlled trials, PROWESS and ADDRESS (see section 5.1), 28- day and in-hospital mortality were higher in patients treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) compared to placebo for the sub-population of patients with single organ dysfunction and recent surgery (n=98 in PROWESS and n=636 in ADDRESS).
• Recent administration (within 3 days) of thrombolytic therapy • Recent administration (within 7 days) of oral anticoagulants • Recent administration (within 7 days) of aspirin or other platelet inhibitors • Recent (within 3 months) ischaemic stroke • Any other condition in which the physician considers significant bleeding is likely
Over the infusion period (study days 0-6) the number of patients experiencing CNS bleeding was 5 versus 1 (2.1% versus 0.4%) for the overall population (drotrecogin alfa (activated) versus placebo), with 4 of the 5 events in the drotrecogin alfa (activated) group occurring in patients ≤ 60 days old or ≤ 3.5 kg bodyweight.
Caution should be employed when Xigris is used with other drugs that affect haemostasis (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) including Protein C, thrombolytics (e. g. streptokinase, tPA, rPA and urokinase), oral anticoagulants (e. g. warfarin), hirudins, antithrombin, aspirin and other anti platelets agents, e. g. non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ticlopidine and clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa antagonists (such as abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) and prostacyclins such as iloprost.
In a randomised study of heparin versus placebo (XPRESS) in 1935 adult severe sepsis patients, all treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated), prophylactic heparin did not adversely affect mortality (heparin 28.3% versus placebo 31.9% in the overall ITT population, and heparin 30.3% versus placebo 26.9% in patients with multiple organ dysfunction treated within 24 hours of their first sepsis-induced organ dysfunction (n=890)).
In XPRESS, a randomised study of prophylactic heparin versus placebo in adult severe sepsis patients, all treated with drotrecogin alfa (activated), serious bleeding rates were consistent with those observed in previous studies over the treatment period of 0-6 days, and prophylactic heparin did not increase the risk of serious bleeding compared to placebo (2.3% vs 2.5%, respectively), including CNS bleeding (0.3% on both arms).
Organ dysfunction was defined as shock, hypotension or the need for vasopressor support despite adequate fluid resuscitation, relative hypoxemia (ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood in mmHg to the percentage of oxygen in the inspired air expressed as a decimal (PaO2/ FiO2 ratio) < 250), oliguria despite adequate fluid resuscitation, marked reduction in blood platelet counts, and/ or elevated lactic acid concentrations.
Exclusion criteria encompassed patients at high risk of bleeding (see sections 4.3 and 4.4), patients who were not expected to survive for 28 days due to a pre-existing, non-sepsis related medical condition, HIV positive patients whose most recent CD4 count was ≤ 50/ mm3, patients on chronic dialysis, and patients who had undergone bone marrow, lung, liver, pancreas or small bowel transplantation, and patients with acute clinical pancreatitis without a proven source of infection.
Changes observed in monkeys at, or in small excess of, the maximum human exposure during repeated dose studies, were all related to the pharmacological effect of Xigris and include beside the expected prolongation of APTT, decreases in haemoglobin, erythrocytes and haematocrit, and increases in reticulocyte count and PT.

Other side effects seen at this lower frequency are reactions at the injection site, headache, hypertonia (muscle tension), hypothyroidism (under-activity of the thyroid gland), impaired glucose tolerance, asthenia (weakness) and development of antibodies (proteins that are produced in response to NutropinAq).
Based on the review of the data and the company’ s response to the CHMP’ s list of questions, at the time of the withdrawal, the CHMP had given a negative opinion and did not recommend the approval of NutropinAq for the long-term treatment of children with severe idiopathic short stature.
• Long-term treatment of children with growth failure due to inadequate endogenous growth hormone secretion. • Long-term treatment of growth failure associated with Turner syndrome. • Treatment of prepubertal children with growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency up to the time of renal transplantation. • Replacement of growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency originating in either childhood or adulthood.
• In patients with previous malignant disease, the doctor should give special attention to signs and symptoms of relapse. • In patients with a history of brain lesions, the patient should be examined frequently for a progression or recurrence of the lesion. • Children with Prader-Willi syndrome should not be treated with NutropinAq unless they are also suffering from growth hormone failure. • In patients with acute critical illness in intensive care units, the doctor should carefully evaluate the safety of continuing somatropin treatment. • If during growing a limp or hip or knee pain develops, please ask the doctor for advice. • Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth.
To be taken in consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. • If symptoms like visual changes, headache, nausea and/ or vomiting occur, especially within the first eight weeks after starting somatropin therapy, please ask the doctor for advice. • In case of an untreated decrease of thyroid gland function (hypothyroidism), the optimal response to somatropin may be reduced.
Severe hypothyroidism has to be treated prior to start of NutropinAq therapy. • Since somatropin therapy following renal transplantation has not been adequately tested, growth hormone treatment should be terminated after that surgery. • Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH) -deficient patients should consult the doctor regularly during growth hormone therapy.
• Concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids may reduce the growth-promoting effect of somatropin. • Because somatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity, patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their antidiabetic therapy. • During concomitant administration of somatropin with corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants or cyclosporin, please ask the doctor for advice.
Those affecting the skin: lipodystrophy (disturbed fat metabolism), skin atrophy, exfoliative inflammation of the skin, urticaria (allergic disorder marked by raised oedematous patches of skin or mucus membrane), excessive growth of hair on the face and body (hirsutism), skin hypertrophy.

It is used to treat adult patients who have leukaemia (cancer of the white blood cells): • it is used in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), a type of leukaemia where granulocytes (a type of white blood cell) start growing out of control, in all phases of the disease (chronic, accelerated and blast).
Sprycel is used when patients cannot tolerate, or when their disease is not responding to other treatments including imatinib (another anticancer medicine); • it is also used in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a type of leukaemia where lymphocytes (another type of white blood cell) multiply too quickly, or blast phase CML, when the patients are ‘ Philadelphia chromosome positive ’ (Ph+).
In studies, the most common side effects with Sprycel (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were headache, pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), cough, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, skin rash, musculoskeletal pain (pain in the joints and muscles), infection, haemorrhage (bleeding), superficial oedema (swelling), fatigue (tiredness), pyrexia (fever), neutropenia (low white blood cell counts), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts) and anaemia (low red blood cell counts).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Sprycel’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase CML, and for the treatment of adults with Ph+ ALL and lymphoid blast CML, with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.
In clinical trials of adult CML and Ph+ ALL patients, dose escalation to 140 mg once daily (chronic phase CML) or 100 mg twice daily (advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL) was allowed in patients who did not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dose.
3 Hepatic impairment: no clinical trials were conducted with SPRYCEL in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (trials excluded patients with ALT and/ or AST > 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range and/ or total bilirubin > 2 times the upper limit of the normal range).
Therefore, caution is warranted when dasatinib is coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates of narrow therapeutic index, such as astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) (see section 4.5).
In a Phase III dose-optimisation study in patients with chronic phase CML, grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was reported more frequently in patients treated with 70 mg twice daily than in patients treated with 100 mg once daily; fluid retention was also reported more frequently in patients treated with twice daily schedule compared to once daily (see section 4.8).
In 865 patients with leukaemia treated with dasatinib in Phase II clinical trials, the mean changes from baseline in QTc interval using Fridericia's method (QTcF) were 4 - 6 msec; the upper 95% confidence intervals for all mean changes from baseline were < 7 msec (see section 4.8).
Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index (e. g. astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine)) should be administered with caution in patients receiving dasatinib (see section 4.4).
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were fluid retention (including pleural effusion), diarrhoea, headache, nausea, skin rash, dyspnoea, haemorrhage, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, infection, vomiting, cough, abdominal pain and pyrexia (Table 3).
In the Phase III dose-optimisation study in patients with chronic phase CML (median duration of treatment approximately 8 months), the incidence of pleural effusion and congestive heart failure/ cardiac dysfunction was lower in patients treated with SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily than in those treated with SPRYCEL 70 mg twice daily (Table 2a).
In the Phase III dose-optimisation study in patients with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL, fluid retention (pleural effusion and pericardial effusion) was reported less frequently in patients treated with SPRYCEL 140 mg once daily than in those treated with 70 mg twice daily (Table 2b).

SPRYCEL 20 mg, 50 mg or 70 mg film-coated tablets are available in cartons containing 56 film-coated tablets in 4 blisters of 14 film-coated tablets each, and in cartons containing 60 film-coated tablets in perforated unit dose blisters. They are also available in bottles with child resistant closure containing 60 film-coated tablets.
3 The first 18 weeks of therapy with VIRAMUNE are a critical period which requires close monitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin reactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) or serious hepatitis/ hepatic failure.
VIRAMUNE must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/ day for the first 14 days of VIRAMUNE administration) has been shown not to decrease the incidence of VIRAMUNE-associated rash, and may be associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of VIRAMUNE therapy.
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction, VIRAMUNE must be permanently stopped and not be re- introduced (see section 4.3).
If ASAT and ALAT return to baseline values and if the patient had no clinical signs or symptoms of hepatitis, rash, constitutional symptoms or other findings suggestive of organ dysfunction, it may be possible to reintroduce VIRAMUNE, on a case by case basis, at the starting dosage regimen of 200 mg/ day for 14 days followed by 400 mg/ day.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).

Methadone AUC ↓ 0.40 (0.31 - 0.51) Methadone-maintained patients Methadone Cmin ND beginning VIRAMUNE therapy Methadone Cmax ↓ 0.58 (0.50 - 0.67) should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly.
The postmarketing experience has shown that the most serious adverse reactions are Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis and serious hepatitis/ hepatic failure and hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction.
Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Nevirapine exhibited antiviral activity in vitro against group M HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms (CRF), CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF (median EC50 value of 63 nM).
Nevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited a strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro (see section 4.5) and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination with the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine.
Antiretroviral naive subjects with CD4 cells counts of 200-600/ mm3 were treated with either VIRAMUNE + zidovudine (n = 46), zidovudine + didanosine (n = 51) or VIRAMUNE + zidovudine + didanosine (n = 51) and followed for 52 weeks or longer on therapy.
Results from a trial (ACTG 241) evaluated triple therapy with VIRAMUNE, zidovudine and didanosine compared to zidovudine + didanosine, in 398 HIV-1 infected patients (mean baseline 153 CD4+ cells/ mm3; plasma HIV1 RNA 4.59 log10 copies/ ml), who had received at least 6 months of NRTI therapy prior to enrolment (median 115 weeks).
A durable response for at least one year was documented in a trial (INCAS) for the triple therapy arm with VIRAMUNE, zidovudine and didanosine compared to zidovudine + didanosine or VIRAMUNE + zidovudine in 151 HIV-1 infected, treatment naive patients with CD4+ cell counts of 200- 600 cells/ mm3 (mean 376 cells/ mm3) and a mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of 4.41 log10 copies/ ml (25,704 copies/ ml).
6 mg 24 to 48 hours postdelivery); or a short oral zidovudine plus lamivudine regimen (mother: zidovudine 600 mg, then 300 mg every 3 hours during labour, followed by 300 mg b. i. d. for 7 days postdelivery plus lamivudine 150 mg b. i. d. during labour and for 7 days postdelivery; infant: zidovudine 12 mg b. i. d. plus lamivudine 6 mg b. i. d. for 7 days [if infant weight < 2 kg, zidovudine 4 mg/ kg b. i. d. plus lamivudine 2 mg/ kg b. i. d. for 7 days]).
Data reported in the literature from 20 HIV infected patients suggest a steady state Cmax of 5.74 µg/ ml (5.00-7.44) and Cmin of 3.73 µg/ ml (3.20-5.08) with an AUC of 109.0 h*µg/ ml (96.0-143.5) in patients taking 200 mg of nevirapine bid.
In a mass balance/ excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine 200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 ± 10.5% of the radiolabelled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 ± 11.1%) representing the primary route of excretion compared to faeces (10.1 ± 1.5%).
The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have been compared in 23 subjects with either mild (50 ≤ CLcr < 80 ml/ min), moderate (30 ≤ CLcr < 50 ml/ min) or severe renal dysfunction (CLcr< 30 ml/min), renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, and 8 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr> 80 ml/ min).
In a 200 mg nevirapine single dose pharmacokinetic study of HIV-negative patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=6; Child-Pugh B, n=4), a significant increase in the AUC of nevirapine was observed in one Child-Pugh B patient with ascites suggesting that patients with worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of accumulating nevirapine in the systemic circulation.
Data concerning the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been derived from two major sources: a 48 week paediatric trial in South Africa (BI 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral naïve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years.
The recommended dose for VIRAMUNE is 20 ml (200 mg) oral suspension once daily for the first 14 days (this lead-in period should be used because it has been found to lessen the frequency of rash), followed by 20 ml (200 mg) oral suspension twice daily, in combination with at least two additional antiretroviral agents.
25 The first 18 weeks of therapy with VIRAMUNE are a critical period which requires close monitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin reactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) or serious hepatitis/ hepatic failure.
VIRAMUNE must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/ day for the first 14 days of VIRAMUNE administration) has been shown not to decrease the incidence of VIRAMUNE-associated rash, and may be associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of VIRAMUNE therapy.

37 Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV infected patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra- abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Nevirapine exhibited antiviral activity in vitro against group M HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms (CRF), CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG and CRF12_BF (median EC50 value of 63 nM).

In 398 treatment-experienced adults (who had taken treatment for HIV infection before), VIRAMUNE, in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine, led to a 38% reduction in viral loads after 48 weeks, compared to a 28% rise in those taking zidovudine and lamivudine.
Clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adult patients when size or number of lesions limit the efficacy and/or acceptability of cryotherapy and other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate.
These protocol mandated clinical sign assessments indicate that local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation/flaking/scaling (23%) and oedema (14%) were common in these placebo controlled clinical trials with imiquimod cream applied three times weekly (see section 4.4).
Peak serum drug concentrations at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2, and 1.6 ng/mL for the applications to face (12.5 mg, 1 single-use sachet), scalp (25 mg, 2 sachets) and hands/arms (75 mg, 6 sachets), respectively.
Excipients: isostearic acid, benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, white soft paraffin, polysorbate 60, sorbitan stearate, glycerol, methyl hydroxybenzoate (E218), propyl hydroxybenzoate (E216), xanthan gum, purified water.
24 • If you have previously used Aldara cream or other similar preparations tell your doctor before starting this treatment. • Tell your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. • Do not use Aldara cream until the area to be treated has healed after previous drug or surgical treatment. • Avoid contact with the eyes, lips and nostrils.
In the event of accidental contact, remove cream by rinsing with water. • Do not apply the cream internally. • Do not use more cream than your doctor has advised. • Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings after you have applied Aldara cream. • If the treated site becomes too uncomfortable, wash the cream off with mild soap and water.
Very common side effects (likely to occur in more than 1 in 10 patients) Common side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 patients) Uncommon side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 patients) Rare side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients) Very rare side effects (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10,000 patients).
If you experience skin lesions or spots on your skin that start out as small red areas and progress to look like mini targets, possibly with symptoms such as itching, fever, overall ill feeling, achy joints, vision problems, burning, painful or itchy eyes and mouth sores, stop using Aldara cream and tell your doctor immediately.
Commonly some patients (4% or less) have experienced headache, uncommonly fevers and flu like symptoms joint and muscle pains; prolapse of the womb; pain on intercourse in females; erection difficulties; increase in sweating; feeling sick; stomach and bowel symptoms; ringing in the ears; flushing; tiredness; dizziness; migraine; pins and needles; insomnia; depression; loss of appetite; swollen glands; bacterial, viral and fungal infections (e.g. cold sores); vaginal infection including thrush; cough and colds with sore throat.
Uncommonly some patients experience changes at the application site (bleeding, inflammation, discharge, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, pins and needles, scabbing, scarring, ulceration or a feeling of warmth or discomfort), or inflammation of the lining of the nose, stuffy nose, flu or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelid, throat pain, diarrhoea, actinic keratosis, redness, swelling of the face, ulcers, pain in extremity, fever, weakness or shivering.
Aldara is used in adults to treat the following skin diseases: • warts on the genitals and around the anus; • small basal cell carcinomas (slow-growing types of skin cancer); • actinic keratoses of the face and scalp (precancerous, abnormal skin growths that develop after too much exposure to sunlight), in patients whose immune system is working normally.
The number of times Aldara is applied and the duration of treatment depend on the condition being treated: • For genital warts, Aldara is applied three times a week for up to 16 weeks. • For small basal cell carcinomas, the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks. • For actinic keratoses, it is applied three times a week, for one or two four-week courses, with four weeks between courses.
In all studies, Aldara was more effective than placebo. • In the treatment of genital warts, the total clearance rate across the four main studies was 15 to 52% in the Aldara-treated patients, compared with 3 to 18% in the placebo-treated patients. • When the results of the two studies in basal cell carcinoma were looked at together, total clearance was seen in 66 to 80% of Aldara-treated patients compared with 0 to 3% in the placebo group.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Aldara’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts (condylomata acuminata), small basal cell carcinomas and nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses in immunocompetent adult patients when other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate.
These included: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (including acetylsalicylic acid), anilides (such as paracetamol), H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin and cardiac glycosides, organic nitrates and other vasodilators for cardiac diseases, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists, oral anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, statins, fibrates and benzodiazepine derivatives.
Adverse reactions, defined as adverse events considered at least possibly attributable to strontium ranelate treatment in phase III studies are listed below using the following convention (frequencies versus placebo): very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000).
In phase III studies, the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) observed over 5 years was approximately 0.7%, with a relative risk of 1.4 (95% CI = [1.0; 2.0]) in strontium ranelate treated patients as compared to placebo (see section 4.4).
Gastrointestinal disorders Frequency unknown: vomiting, abdominal pain, oral mucosal irritation including stomatitis and/ or mouth ulceration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Frequency unknown: hypersensitivity skin reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
In phase III studies, which demonstrated the anti-fracture efficacy of PROTELOS treatment, measured mean BMD increased from baseline with PROTELOS by approximately 4% per year at the lumbar spine and 2% per year at the femoral neck, reaching 13% to 15% and 5% to 6% respectively after 3 years, depending on the study.
In phase III studies, as compared to placebo, biochemical markers of bone formation (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) increased and those of bone resorption (serum C-telopeptide and urinary N-telopeptide cross links) decreased from the third month of treatment up to 3 years.
In an a-posteriori analysis of patients from the pooled SOTI and TROPOS studies with baseline lumbar spine and / or femoral neck BMD in the osteopenic range and without prevalent fracture but with at least one additional risk factor for fracture (N=176), PROTELOS reduced the risk of a first vertebral fracture by 72% over 3 years (incidence of vertebral fracture 3.6% with strontium ranelate vs.
An a-posteriori analysis was performed on a subgroup of patients from the TROPOS study of particular medical interest and at high-risk of fracture [defined by a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ - 3 SD (manufacturer’ s range corresponding to -2.4 SD using NHANES III) and an age ≥ 74 years (n=1,977, i. e.
Patients with renal impairment In patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (30-70 ml/ min creatinine clearance), strontium clearance decreases as creatinine clearance decreases (approximately 30% decrease over the creatinine clearance range 30 to 70 ml/ min) and thereby induces an increase in strontium plasma levels.
The following side effects have also been reported by patients taking PROTELOS: vomiting, abdominal pain, oral irritation (such as mouth ulcers and gum inflammation), bone, muscle and/ or joint pain, muscle cramps, hypersensitivity syndromes (allergic reactions including rash and fever), itching, hives, angioedema (such as swollen face, tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing), swelling in limbs, feeling confused.

It must not be used in patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones and acids in the blood), diabetic pre-coma, problems with their kidneys or liver, conditions that may affect the kidneys, or a disease that causes a reduced supply of oxygen to the tissues such as failure of the heart or lungs or a recent heart attack.
Therefore, the Committee decided that the benefits of Icandra are greater than its risks for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral metformin alone or who are already treated with the combination of vildagliptin and metformin as separate tablets.
Hepatic impairment Icandra should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, including those with pre-treatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8).
− Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients − Diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma − Renal failure or renal dysfunction defined as creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min (see section 4.4) − Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function, such as:
In data from controlled monotherapy and add-on therapy trials of up to 24 weeks in duration, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3x ULN (classified as present on at least 2 consecutive measurements or at the final on-treatment visit) was 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.2% for vildagliptin 50 mg once daily, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily and all comparators, respectively.

A meta-analysis of placebo- controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 years old Cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8).
Caution is advisable if ARICLAIM is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like SSRIs, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum), venlafaxine or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.
Caution is advised if ARICLAIM is co-administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).
Effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine Antacids and H2 antagonists: co-administration of ARICLAIM with aluminium- and magnesium- containing antacids or with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.
2 Cases of orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of treatment 3 See section 4.4 4 Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4) 5 Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment discontinuation.
The efficacy of duloxetine 40 mg given twice daily in the treatment of SUI was established in four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, that randomised 1913 women (22 to 83 years) with SUI; of these, 958 patients were randomised to duloxetine and 955 to placebo.
Female rats receiving duloxetine before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

How duloxetine works in SUI is not clear but it is thought that, by increasing the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline at the level of the nerves that control the muscle of the urethra (the tube that leads from the bladder to outside), duloxetine causes a stronger closure of the urethra during urine storage.

The six main clinical studies involved 1,202 adults (over the age of 16) and 1,535 children (aged 2 to 16 years of age), and Protopy was compared either with placebo (a dummy treatment, the ointment base) or with a topical corticosteroid often used for eczema (hydrocortisone butyrate in adults, hydrocortisone acetate in children).
er The purpose of the third multicentre, double-blind, randomised study was the assessment of efficacy ng and safety of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice a day relative to twice daily administration of 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment in children with moderate to severe atopic lo dermatitis.
ed Most atopic dermatitis patients (adults and children) treated with single or repeated application of tacrolimus ointment (0.03 - 0.1%), and infants from age of 5 months treated with tacrolimus ointment (0.03%) had blood concentrations < 1.0 ng/ ml.
er Distribution ng As systemic exposure is low with tacrolimus ointment, the high binding of tacrolimus (> 98.8%) to plasma proteins is considered not to be clinically relevant. lo Following topical application of tacrolimus ointment, tacrolimus is selectively delivered to the skin with minimal diffusion into the systemic circulation. no
er possibility of interactions cannot be ruled out and the concomitant systemic administration of known CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and diltiazem) in patients with ng widespread and/ or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution. lo A potential interaction between vaccination and application of Protopy ointment has not been investigated.
Via its binding to a specific cytoplasmic immunophilin (FKBP12), tacrolimus inhibits calcium- dependent signal transduction pathways in T cells, thereby preventing the transcription and synthesis of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and other cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-α and IFN-γ.
Most atopic dermatitis patients (adults and children) treated with single or repeated application of tacrolimus ointment (0.03 - 0.1%), and infants from age of 5 months treated with tacrolimus ointment (0.03%) had blood concentrations < 1.0 ng/ ml.

er (> 1%) side effects are redness, feeling of warmth, pain, increased skin sensitivity (especially to hot and cold), skin tingling, rash, folliculitis (inflamed or infected hair follicles) and herpes viral infections ng (e. g. cold sores, generalised herpes simplex infections).
An in vivo clinical interaction study showed that the administration of aluminium and magnesium hydroxides either two hours before or together with strontium ranelate caused a slight decrease in the absorption of strontium ranelate (20-25% AUC decrease), while absorption was almost unaffected when the antacid was given two hours after strontium ranelate.
These included: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (including acetylsalicylic acid), anilides (such as paracetamol), H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, digoxin and cardiac glycosides, organic nitrates and other vasodilators for cardiac diseases, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists, oral anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, statins, fibrates and benzodiazepine derivatives.
Adverse reactions, defined as adverse events considered at least possibly attributable to strontium ranelate treatment in phase III studies are listed below using the following convention (frequencies versus placebo): very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000).
In phase III studies, the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) observed over5 years was approximately 0.7%, with a relative risk of 1.4 (95% CI = [1.0; 2.0]) in strontium ranelate treated patients as compared to placebo (see section 4.4).
Gastrointestinal disorders Frequency unknown: vomiting, abdominal pain, oral mucosal irritation including stomatitis and/ or mouth ulceration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Frequency unknown: hypersensitivity skin reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Cases of severe hypersensitivity syndromes including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (see section 4.4).
In phase III studies, which demonstrated the anti-fracture efficacy of OSSEOR treatment, measured mean BMD increased from baseline with OSSEOR by approximately 4% per year at the lumbar spine and 2% per year at the femoral neck, reaching 13% to 15% and 5% to 6% respectively after 3 years, depending on the study.
In phase III studies, as compared to placebo, biochemical markers of bone formation (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) increased and those of bone resorption (serum C-telopeptide and urinary N-telopeptide cross links) decreased from the third month of treatment up to 3 years.
In an a-posteriori analysis of patients from the pooled SOTI and TROPOS studies with baseline lumbar spine and / or femoral neck BMD in the osteopenic range and without prevalent fracture but with at least one additional risk factor for fracture (N=176), OSSEOR reduced the risk of a first vertebral fracture by 72% over 3 years (incidence of vertebral fracture 3.6% with strontium ranelate vs.
An a-posteriori analysis was performed on a subgroup of patients from the TROPOS study of particular medical interest and at high-risk of fracture [defined by a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ - 3 SD (manufacturer’ s range corresponding to -2.4 SD using NHANES III) and an age ≥ 74 years (n=1,977, i. e.
Patients with renal impairment In patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (30-70 ml/ min creatinine clearance), strontium clearance decreases as creatinine clearance decreases (approximately 30% decrease over the creatinine clearance range 30 to 70 ml/ min) and thereby induces an increase in strontium plasma levels.
The following side effects have also been reported by patients taking OSSEOR: vomiting, abdominal pain, oral irritation (such as mouth ulcers and gum inflammation), bone, muscle and/ or joint pain, muscle cramps, hypersensitivity syndromes (allergic reactions including rash and fever), itching, hives, angioedema (such as swollen face, tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing), swelling in limbs, feeling confused.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use (CHMP) concluded that DepoCyte has shown effectiveness in lymphomatous meningitis when compared with the standard formulation of cytarabine, and that its administration schedule, with fewer intrathecal injections, can be of benefit to the patient ’ s quality of life.

In vitro studies, examining more than 60 cell lines, demonstrated that the median cytarabine concentration resulting in 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was approximately 10 μ M (2.4 μ g/ ml) for two days of exposure and 0.1 μ M (0.024 μ g/ ml) for 6 days of exposure.
In an open-label, active-controlled, multicentre clinical study, 35 patients with lymphomatous meningitis (with malignant cells found on CSF cytology) were randomised to intrathecal therapy with either DepoCyte (n=18) or unencapsulated cytarabine (n=17).
The active ingredient of DepoCyte, cytarabine, was mutagenic in in vitro tests and was clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchange in human leukocytes) and in vivo (chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchange assay in rodent bone marrow, mouse micronucleus assay).
The following protective recommendations are given due to the toxic nature of this substance: • personnel should be trained in good technique for handling anticancer agents • male and female staff who are trying to conceive and female staff who are pregnant should be excluded from working with the substance • personnel must wear protective clothing: goggles, gowns, disposable gloves and masks • a designated area should be defined for preparation (preferably under a laminar flow system).
The work surface should be protected by disposable, plastic backed, absorbent paper • all items used during administration or cleaning should be placed in high risk, waste-disposal bags for high temperature incineration • in the event of accidental contact with the skin, exposed areas should be washed immediately with soap and water • in the event of accidental contact with the mucous membranes, exposed areas should be treated immediately by copious lavage with water; medical attention should be sought.
• Pain, numbness or tingling (feeling of sensation of pins and needles) • Nausea and/ or vomiting • Weakness • Confusion • Fever • Headaches • Fatigue • Convulsion • Dizziness • Neck pain • A stiff or rigid neck • Partial paralysis • Blindness and other visual disturbances • Shaking • Back pain
When changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen with Lantus, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the concomitant antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of additional regular insulins or fast- acting insulin analogues or the dose of oral antidiabetic agents).
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e. g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e. g. clozapine and olanzapine) and protease inhibitors.

Side effects are uncommon in patients treated with Circadin, but the most common side effects (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 1,000) are irritability, nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, abnormal dreams, migraine, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness with increased activity), dizziness, somnolence (drowsiness), abdominal (tummy) pain, constipation, dry mouth, hyperbilirubinaemia (raised blood levels of bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells, which can cause yellowing of the skin and eyes), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), asthenia (weakness) and increased weight.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that, although Circadin has been shown to have a small effect size in a relatively small fraction of patients, its benefits are greater than its risks for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia characterised by poor quality of sleep in patients who are aged 55 or over.
Therefore, interactions between melatonin and other active substances as a consequence of their effect on CYP1A enzymes is possible. • Caution should be exercised in patients on fluvoxamine, which increases melatonin levels (by 17-fold higher AUC and a 12-fold higher serum Cmax) by inhibiting its metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.
The combination should be avoided. • Caution should be exercised in patients on 5- or 8-methoxypsoralen (5 and 8-MOP), which increases melatonin levels by inhibiting its metabolism. • Caution should be exercised in patients on cimetidine a CYP2D inhibitor, which increases plasma melatonin levels, by inhibiting its metabolism. • Cigarette smoking may decrease melantonin levels due to induction of CYP1A2. • Caution should be exercised in patients on oestrogens (e. g. contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy), which increase melatonin levels by inhibiting its metabolism by CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. • CYP1A2 inhibitors such as quinolones may give rise to increased melatonin exposure. • CYP1A2 inducers such as carbamazepine and rifampicin may give rise to reduced plasma concentrations of melatonin. • There is a large amount of data in the literature regarding the effect of adrenergic agonists/ antagonists, opiate agonists/ antagonists, antidepressant medicinal products, prostaglandin inhibitors, benzodiazepines, tryptophan and alcohol, on endogenous melatonin secretion.
• Alcohol should not be taken with Circadin, because it reduces the effectiveness of Circadin on sleep. • Circadin may enhance the sedative properties of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as zalepon, zolpidem and zopiclone.

Clinical efficacy In clinical trials, where patients suffering from primary insomnia received Circadin 2 mg every evening for 3 weeks, benefits were shown in treated patients compared to placebo in sleep latency (as measured by objective and subjective means) and in subjective quality of sleep and daytime functioning (restorative sleep) with no impairment of vigilance during the day.
In a polysomnographic (PSG) study with a run-in of 2 weeks (single-blind with placebo treatment), followed by a treatment period of 3 weeks (double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design) and a 3-week withdrawal period, sleep latency (SL) was shortened by 9 minutes compared to placebo.
In an outpatient study with 2 week run-in baseline period with placebo, a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group treatment period of 3 weeks and 2 week withdrawal period with placebo, the rate of patients who showed a clinically significant improvement in both quality of sleep and morning alertness was 47% in the Circadin group as compared to 27% in the placebo group.
In a second outpatient study with two week run in baseline period with placebo and a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group treatment period of 3 weeks, the rate of patients who showed a clinically significant improvement in both quality of sleep and morning alertness was 26% in the Circadin group as compared to 15% in the placebo group.
The levels assessed in the blood of the patients at 23:00 (2 hours after administration) following 1 and 3 weeks of daily administration were 411.4 ± 56.5 and 432.00 ± 83.2 pg/ ml respectively, and are similar to those found in in healthy volunteers following a single dose of Circadin 2 mg.
These medicines include hypnotics and tranquilisers (e. g. benzodiazepines), fluvoxamine, thioridazine and imipramine (used to treat depression or psychiatric problems), oestrogen (contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy), cimetidine and psoralens (used to treat skin problems e. g. psoriasis).

Sifrol can be used either on its own or in combination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson’ s disease), at any stage of disease including the later stages when levodopa starts becoming less effective; • moderate to severe restless legs syndrome, a disorder where the patient has uncontrollable urges to move the limbs to stop uncomfortable, painful or odd sensations in the body, usually at night.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Sifrol’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’ s disease alone or in combination with levodopa, and for the treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome in dosages up to 0.54 mg of base.

Hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic agents In clinical trials of Xelevia as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with agents not known to cause hypoglycaemia (i. e. metformin or pioglitazone), rates of hypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo.
In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
1 In this placebo-controlled 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in combination with metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/ metformin compared to treatment with placebo/ metformin was 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
In pooled studies of up to 1 year in duration comparing sitagliptin/ metformin to a sulphonylurea agent/ metformin, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulphonylurea agent are as follows: anorexia (Metabolism and nutritional disorders; frequency uncommon) and weight decreased (Investigations; frequency uncommon).
2 In this 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in combination with glimepiride, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/ glimepiride compared to treatment with placebo/ glimepiride was 11.3% and 6.6%, respectively.
3 In this 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in combination with glimepiride and metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin in combination with glimepiride/ metformin compared to treatment with placebo in combination with glimepiride/ metformin was 18.1% and 7.1%, respectively.
4 In this 24-week study of the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily and pioglitazone, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/ pioglitazone compared to patients treated with placebo/ pioglitazone was 9.1% and 9.0%, respectively.
In addition, in monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks in duration of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily alone compared to placebo, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness.
In a 24-week study of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin administered twice daily (sitagliptin/ metformin 50 mg/ 500 mg or 50 mg/ 1000 mg), the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with placebo was 14.0% and 9.7%, respectively.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0% each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7%), with the differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
It is used with diet and exercise, together with one or more antidiabetes medicines: • in combination with metformin, in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin alone; • in combination with a sulphonylurea in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled with a sulphonylurea alone and in whom metformin is not suitable; • in combination with both metformin and a sulphonylurea, when both medicines are not sufficient to give satisfactory control of the patient ’ s diabetes; • in combination with a PPAR gamma agonist, such as a thiazolidinedione, in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on the PPAR gamma agonist alone.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Xelevia’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea, or a PPAR gamma agonist, when diet and exercise plus the other medicines do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
The most common side effects with Advagraf (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are tremor (shaking), headache, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, kidney problems, hyperglycaemia (raised blood glucose levels), diabetes, hyperkalaemia (raised blood potassium levels), hypertension (high blood pressure) and insomnia (difficulty sleeping).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Advagraf’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney and liver allograft recipients, and in the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients.
Other allografts transplantation Although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung-transplanted, pancreas-transplanted and intestine-transplanted patients, Prograf has been used in lung-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg/ kg/ day, in pancreas-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.2 mg/ kg/ day and in intestinal transplantation at an initial oral dose of 0.3 mg/ kg/ day.
During the initial post-transplant period, monitoring of the following parameters should be undertaken on a routine basis: blood pressure, ECG, neurological and visual status, fasting blood glucose levels, electrolytes (particularly potassium), liver and renal function tests, haematology parameters, coagulation values, and plasma protein determinations.
In vitro the following substances have been shown to be potential inhibitors of tacrolimus metabolism: bromocriptine, cortisone, dapsone, ergotamine, gestodene, lidocaine, mephenytoin, miconazole, midazolam, nilvadipine, norethindrone, quinidine, tamoxifen, (triacetyl)oleandomycin.
Other interactions which have led to clinically detrimental effects Concurrent use of tacrolimus with medicinal products known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects may increase these effects (e. g., aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors, vancomycin, cotrimoxazole, NSAIDs, ganciclovir or aciclovir).
In case of in utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn for the potential adverse events of tacrolimus is recommended (in particular effects on the kidneys). There is a risk for premature delivery (< 37 week) as well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 neonates, i. e.
Adverse reactions are listed below in descending order by frequency of occurrence: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
diarrhoea, nausea gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions, gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation, gastrointestinal haemorrhages, stomatitis and ulceration, ascites, vomiting, gastrointestinal and abdominal pains, dyspeptic signs and symptoms, constipation, flatulence, bloating and distension, loose stools, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms
The treatment difference (Advagraf – Prograf) was 3.3% (95% confidence interval [-5.7%, 12.3%]). The 12-month patient survival rates were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90.8% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 25 patients died (14 female, 11 male) and in the Prograf arm 24 patients died (5 female, 19 male).
The incidence of efficacy failure at 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy- confirmed acute rejection, or lost to follow-up) was 14.0% in the Advagraf group (N=214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N=212) and 17.0% in the ciclosporin group (N=212).
The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf-ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs. ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs. ciclosporin.
The 12-month patient survival rates were 98.6% for Advagraf, 95.7% for Prograf and 97.6% for ciclosporin; in the Advagraf arm 3 patients died (all male), in the Prograf arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the ciclosporin arm 6 patients died (3 female, 3 male).
Intestinal transplantation Published clinical experience from a single centre on the use of oral Prograf for primary treatment following intestinal transplantation showed that the actuarial survival rate of 155 patients (65 intestine alone, 75 liver and intestine, and 25 multivisceral) receiving tacrolimus and prednisone was 75% at 1 year, 54% at 5 years, and 42% at 10 years.
A variety of innovations, such as techniques for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, the adjunct use of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial tacrolimus doses with target trough levels of 10 to 15 ng/ ml, and most recently allograft irradiation were considered to have contributed to improved results in this indication over time (Abu- Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234:404).
Other allografts transplantation Although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung-transplanted, pancreas-transplanted and intestine-transplanted patients, Prograf has been used in lung-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg/ kg/ day, in pancreas-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.2 mg/ kg/ day and in intestinal transplantation at an initial oral dose of 0.3 mg/ kg/ day.
During the initial post-transplant period, monitoring of the following parameters should be undertaken on a routine basis: blood pressure, ECG, neurological and visual status, fasting blood glucose levels, electrolytes (particularly potassium), liver and renal function tests, haematology parameters, coagulation values, and plasma protein determinations.
In vitro the following substances have been shown to be potential inhibitors of tacrolimus metabolism: bromocriptine, cortisone, dapsone, ergotamine, gestodene, lidocaine, mephenytoin, miconazole, midazolam, nilvadipine, norethindrone, quinidine, tamoxifen, (triacetyl)oleandomycin.
Other interactions which have led to clinically detrimental effects Concurrent use of tacrolimus with medicinal products known to have nephrotoxic or neurotoxic effects may increase these effects (e. g., aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors, vancomycin, cotrimoxazole, NSAIDs, ganciclovir or aciclovir).
In case of in utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn for the potential adverse events of tacrolimus is recommended (in particular effects on the kidneys). There is a risk for premature delivery (< 37 week) as well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 neonates, i. e.
Adverse reactions are listed below in descending order by frequency of occurrence: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 3.2 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
Your doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (e. g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), certain pain killers (so-called NSAIDs, e. g. ibuprofen), anticoagulants, or oral medication for diabetic treatment, while you take Advagraf.
Fabry Disease is a glycosphingolipid storage disorder that is caused by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme α -galactosidase A, resulting in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (also referred to as Gb3 or CTH), the glycosphingolipid substrate for this enzyme.
Longer term therapy (48-54 months) resulted in stabilisation of GFR in male patients with normal baseline GFR (≥ 90 mL/ min/ 1.73 m2) and with mild to moderate renal dysfunction (GFR 60 to < 90 mL/ min/ 1.73 m2), and in slowing of the rate of decline in renal function and progression to end-stage renal disease in male Fabry patients with more severe renal dysfunction (GFR 30 to < 60 mL/ min/ 1.73 m2).

All of the patients also took tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine (other antiviral medicines); The other three studies involved adults who were already receiving HIV treatment but were not responding to it: • one study compared ritonavir-boosted Prezista with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in 604 patients who had taken some anti-HIV medicines in the past; • two studies involved 628 patients who had taken many anti-HIV medicines in the past and compared ritonavir-boosted Prezista with other protease inhibitors chosen on the basis of the patient’ s previous treatments and predicted response.
In the two studies of patients who had received many anti-HIV medicines in the past, 70% of those taking the approved dose of ritonavir-boosted Prezista (92 out of 131) and 21% of the patients taking the comparator protease inhibitors (26 out of 124) had at least a 90% reduction in viral load after 24 weeks.
It must not be taken by patients who have severe problems with their liver, or who are taking the following medicines: • rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis); • ritonavir-boosted lopinavir; • St John’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression); • medicines that are broken down in the same way as Prezista and are harmful at high levels in the blood.
These active substances include e. g. antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, systemic lidocaine), antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (e. g. dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (cisapride), neuroleptics (pimozide, sertindole), sedatives/ hypnotics (triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5)) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin and lovastatin) (see section 4.5).
These medicinal products include amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, systemic lidocaine, astemizole, terfenadine, midazolam administered orally, triazolam, cisapride, pimozide, sertindole, simvastatin, lovastatin and the ergot alkaloids (e. g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine) (see section 4.3).
A clinical study utilising a cocktail of drugs that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of PREZISTA/ rtv, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir.
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.
Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, repaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (e. g. indinavir, systemic azoles like ketoconazole and clotrimazole).
Interaction table Interactions between darunavir/ ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, not determined as “ ND”, twice daily as “ b. i. d.”, once daily as “ q. d.” and once every other day as “ q. o. d.”).
Based on the different elimination pathways of the other NRTIs zidovudine, zalcitabine, emtricitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, that are primarily renally excreted, and abacavir for which metabolism is not mediated by CYP450, no interactions are expected for these medicinal compounds and PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir.
The results of this interaction trial show that atorvastatin (10 mg q.d.) in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg b.i.d.) provides an exposure to atorvastatin, which is only 15% lower than that obtained with (40 mg q.d.) atorvastatin alone.
If concomitant use of PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir with sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil is indicated, sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg dose in 72 hours or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg dose in 72 hours is recommended.
In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules b.i.d were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide.
The adverse drug reactions are derived from Phase IIb and Phase III trials, in which a total of 1,968 treatment-experienced patients initiated therapy with the recommended dose of PREZISTA 600 mg 11 with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.Median exposure to PREZISTA/ritonavir in this group was 37.3 weeks.
pancreatitis, gastritis, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, aphthous stomatitis, stomatitis, retching, haematemesis, dry mouth, abdominal discomfort, constipation, increased lipase, eructation, oral dysaesthesia, cheilitis, dry lip, coated tongue
Common: hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, anorexia, insomnia, headache, dizziness, dysgeusia, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, flatulence, increased alanine aminotransferase, rash (including maculopapular, papular rash), alopecia, dry skin, pruritus, fatigue.
Uncommon: upper respiratory tract infection, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, abnormal dreams, hypoaesthesia, disturbance in attention, somnolence, dyspepsia, eructation, increased aspartate aminotransferase, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, dermatitis, night sweats, myalgia, muscle spasms, asthenia.
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump) (see section 4.4).
Antiviral activity in vitro Darunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory strains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human monocytes/macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to 5.0 ng/ml).
Darunavir showed synergistic antiviral activity when studied in combination with the protease inhibitors ritonavir, nelfinavir, or amprenavir and additive antiviral activity when studied in combination with the protease inhibitors indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, or tipranavir, the N(t)RTIs zidovudine, lamivudine, zalcitabine, didanosine, stavudine, abacavir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir, the NNRTIs nevirapine, delavirdine, or efavirenz and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide.
53-641-fold change in EC50 values [FC]) from 9 HIV-1 strains harbouring multiple PI Resistance-Associated Mutations (RAMs) showed that a minimum of 8 darunavir in vitro selected mutations were required in the HIV-1 protease to render a virus resistant (FC > 10) to darunavir.
In a pooled analysis of the POWER 1, 2 and 3 (see Clinical experience subsection) and DUET 1 and 2 (TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216) trials the amino acid substitutions identified that developed on PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) in ≥ 20% of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure by rebound were V32I, I54L and L89V.
Cross-resistance Darunavir has a < 10-fold decreased susceptibility against 90% of 3,309 clinical isolates resistant to amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir and/or tipranavir showing that viruses resistant to most PIs remain susceptible to darunavir.
Efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients The evidence of efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) in treatment-experienced patients is based on the 48 weeks analysis of the Phase III trial TITAN in treatment-experienced lopinavir naïve patients and on the analyses of 96 weeks data from the Phase IIb trials POWER 1, 2 and 3 in patients with high level of PI resistance.
TITAN is an ongoing randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III trial comparing PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) versus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg b.i.d) in treatment-experienced, lopinavir naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.
HIV-1 infected patients who were eligible for these trials had previously failed more than 1 PI containing regimen.PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir plus an optimised background regimen (OBR) was compared to a control group receiving an investigator-selected PI(s) regimen plus an OBR.
Treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) resulted in 56.5% (POWER 1 and 2) and 52.2% (POWER 3) of responders with a decrease of at least 1 log10 in HIV RNA from baseline, 38.9% (POWER 1 and 2) and 42.1% (POWER 3) of subjects with an HIV RNA level < 50 copies/ml and 49.6% (POWER 1 and 2) and 50.0% (POWER 3) respectively of subjects with an HIV RNA level less than 400 copies/ml.
The mean decrease in HIV RNA level compared to baseline was 1.58 (POWER 1 and 2) and 1.43 (POWER 3) log10 copies/ml and a mean increase in CD4+ cell count of 133 x 106 cells/l (POWER 1 and 2) and 103 x 106 cells/l (POWER 3) was observed.
Baseline genotype or phenotype and virologic outcome In a pooled analysis of the 600/100 mg b.i.d. groups of the POWER and DUET trials, the presence at baseline of 3 or more of mutations V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V or L89V was associated with a decreased virologic response to PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir.
* Number of mutations from the list of mutations associated with a diminished response to PREZISTA/ritonavir (V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V or L89V)
Although darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly affected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 ml/min, n=20) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
In a multiple dose study with PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total plasma concentrations of darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects.
These active substances include e.g. antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, systemic lidocaine), antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (cisapride), neuroleptics (pimozide, sertindole), sedatives/hypnotics [triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5)] and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin and lovastatin) (see section 4.5).
Osteonecrosis Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
These medicinal products include amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, systemic lidocaine, astemizole, terfenadine, midazolam administered orally, triazolam, cisapride, pimozide, sertindole, simvastatin, lovastatin and the ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine) (see section 4.3).
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.
Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, repaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (e.g. indinavir, systemic azoles like ketoconazole and clotrimazole).
Interaction table Interactions between darunavir/ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, not determined as “ND”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, once daily as “q.d.” and once every other day as “q.o.d.”).
Based on the different elimination pathways of the other NRTIs zidovudine, zalcitabine, emtricitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, that are primarily renally excreted, and abacavir for which metabolism is not mediated by CYP450, no interactions are expected for these medicinal compounds and PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir.
The results of this interaction trial show that atorvastatin (10 mg q.d.) in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg b.i.d.) provides an exposure to atorvastatin, which is only 15% lower than that obtained with (40 mg q.d.) atorvastatin alone.
If concomitant use of PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir with sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil is indicated, sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg dose in 72 hours or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg dose in 72 hours is recommended.
Rifabutin* 1.6 ND times ↑ ↑ 53% Darunavir ↑ 68% * sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25-O-desacetyl metabolite) A dosage reduction of rifabutin by 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day [i.e. rifabutin 150 mg q.o.d.
In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules b.i.d were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).

37 Clinical experience Efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir in ART-naïve patients The evidence of efficacy of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg q.d. is based on the analyses of 48 week data from the ongoing, randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III trial ARTEMIS in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients comparing PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg q.d. with lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day (given as a twice-daily or as a once-daily regimen).
Efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir in ART-experienced patients The evidence of efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) in treatment-experienced patients is based on the 48 weeks analysis of the Phase III trial TITAN in treatment-experienced lopinavir naïve patients and on the analyses of 96 weeks data from the Phase IIb trials POWER 1, 2 and 3 in patients with high level of PI resistance.
TITAN is an ongoing randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III trial comparing PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) versus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg b.i.d) in treatment-experienced, lopinavir naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.
HIV-1 infected patients who were eligible for these trials had previously failed more than 1 PI containing regimen.PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir plus an optimised background regimen (OBR) was compared to a control group receiving an investigator-selected PI(s) regimen plus an OBR.
Treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) resulted in 56.5% (POWER 1 and 2) and 52.2% (POWER 3) of responders with a decrease of at least 1 log10 in HIV RNA from baseline, 38.9% (POWER 1 and 2) and 42.1% (POWER 3) of subjects with an HIV RNA level < 50 copies/ml and 49.6% (POWER 1 and 2) and 50.0% (POWER 3) respectively of subjects with an HIV RNA level less than 400 copies/ml.
The mean decrease in HIV RNA level compared to baseline was 1.58 (POWER 1 and 2) and 1.43 (POWER 3) log10 copies/ml and a mean increase in CD4+ cell count of 133 x 106 cells/l (POWER 1 and 2) and 103 x 106 cells/l (POWER 3) was observed.
Baseline genotype or phenotype and virologic outcome In a pooled analysis of the 600/100 mg b.i.d. groups of the POWER and DUET trials, the presence at baseline of 3 or more of mutations V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V or L89V was associated with a decreased virologic response to PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir.
* Number of mutations from the list of mutations associated with a diminished response to PREZISTA/ritonavir (V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I 50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V or L89V)
Although darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly affected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 ml/min, n=20) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
In a multiple dose study with PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total plasma concentrations of darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects.
These active substances include e.g. antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, systemic lidocaine), antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (cisapride), neuroleptics (pimozide, sertindole), sedatives/hypnotics (triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5)) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin and lovastatin) (see section 4.5).
Osteonecrosis Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
These medicinal products include amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, systemic lidocaine, astemizole, terfenadine, midazolam administered orally, triazolam, cisapride, pimozide, sertindole, simvastatin, lovastatin and the ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine) (see section 4.3).
A clinical study utilising a cocktail of drugs that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of PREZISTA/rtv, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir.
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.
Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, repaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (e.g. indinavir, systemic azoles like ketoconazole and clotrimazole).
Interaction table Interactions between darunavir/ritonavir and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, not determined as “ND”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, once daily as “q.d.” and once every other day as “q.o.d.”).
Based on the different elimination pathways of the other NRTIs zidovudine, zalcitabine, emtricitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, that are primarily renally excreted, and abacavir for which metabolism is not mediated by CYP450, no interactions are expected for these medicinal compounds and PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir.
The results of this interaction trial show that atorvastatin (10 mg q.d.) in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg b.i.d.) provides an exposure to atorvastatin, which is only 15% lower than that obtained with (40 mg q.d.) atorvastatin alone.
If concomitant use of PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir with sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil is indicated, sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg dose in 72 hours or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg dose in 72 hours is recommended.
In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules b.i.d were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide.
The adverse drug reactions are derived from Phase IIb and Phase III trials, in which a total of 1,968 treatment-experienced patients initiated therapy with the recommended dose of PREZISTA 600 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.Median exposure to PREZISTA/ritonavir in this group was 37.3 weeks.

57 Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump) (see section 4.4).
Darunavir showed synergistic antiviral activity when studied in combination with the protease inhibitors ritonavir, nelfinavir, or amprenavir and additive antiviral activity when studied in combination with the protease inhibitors indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, or tipranavir, the N(t)RTIs zidovudine, lamivudine, zalcitabine, didanosine, stavudine, abacavir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir, the NNRTIs nevirapine, delavirdine, or efavirenz and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide.
53-641-fold change in EC50 values [FC]) from 9 HIV-1 strains harbouring multiple PI Resistance-Associated Mutations (RAMs) showed that a minimum of 8 darunavir in vitro selected mutations were required in the HIV-1 protease to render a virus resistant (FC > 10) to darunavir.
In a pooled analysis of the POWER 1, 2 and 3 (see Clinical experience subsection) and DUET 1 and 2 (TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216) trials the amino acid substitutions identified that developed on PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) in ≥ 20% of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure by rebound were V32I, I54L and L89V.

Efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients The evidence of efficacy of PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) in treatment-experienced patients is based on the 48 weeks analysis of the Phase III trial TITAN in treatment-experienced lopinavir naïve patients and on the analyses of 96 weeks data from the Phase IIb trials POWER 1, 2 and 3 in patients with high level of PI resistance.
TITAN is an ongoing randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III trial comparing PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg b.i.d.) versus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg b.i.d) in treatment-experienced, lopinavir naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.

♦ Rare (these may occur with up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): • Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves • Fits • Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising • Allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to collapse, coma and death
In the HORIZON – Pivotal Fracture Trial [PFT] (see section 5.1), the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in patients receiving Aclasta and placebo, respectively.
Renal dysfunction has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or additional risk factors (e. g oncology patients with chemotherapy, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, severe dehydration), the majority of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3– 4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after a single administration.
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in post-menopausal women (7,736 women aged 65– 89 years) with either: a femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) with a T-score ≤ – 1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral fracture(s); or a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ – 2.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral fracture(s).
Days of disability Aclasta significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to back pain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days respectively compared to placebo (all p < 0.01).
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent hip fracture (RFT) The incidence of clinical fractures, including vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures, was evaluated in 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years (mean age 74.5 years) with a recent (within 90 days) low- trauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study medication.
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone Aclasta was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate Paget’ s disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6– 3.0 times the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by radiographic evidence.
After 6 months, Aclasta showed 96% (169/ 176) and 89% (156/ 176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) normalisation rates compared to 74% (127/ 171) and 58% (99/ 171) for risedronate (all p < 0.001).
After initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased rapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels.
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours.
Since zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity as a direct- acting and/ or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.
Special populations (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/ min (range 22 to 143 ml/ min) in the 64 patients studied.
Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to 40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack of accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that dose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50– 80 ml/ min) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/ min are not necessary.
Subchronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when given 0.6 mg/ kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that corresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute infusions of 0.25 mg/ kg administered at 2– 3-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 times the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs.

Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone.
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).

Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone.
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).
Similar changes were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3 - 4% and haematocrit 3.6 – 4.1% relative reductions) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1 – 2% and haematocrit 1 – 3.2% relative reductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone.

Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:

If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.

Prior to launch and as agreed with competent authorities in the Member States, the MAH shall provide healthcare professionals in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies with the following: • Educational leaflet • Summary of product characteristics (SPC) and Package Leaflet and Labelling • Cool boxes for patients clearly labelled with a visual aid indicating correct use of product.
The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements: • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) • That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increased with the subcutaneous (sc) route. • There is insufficient data on Epoetin alfa HEXAL to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with subcutaneous use • Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CKD • The loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
Epoetin alfa HEXAL is used: for treating symptomatic anaemia associated with kidney disease (given by injection into a vein) in children and adults on dialysis in adults on peritoneal dialysis for treating severe symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease in adults not yet undergoing dialysis (given by injection into a vein) for treating anaemia and reducing the need for a blood transfusion in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the doctor in moderately anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it, donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery (autologous predonation) as an alternative to a blood transfusion in adult patients about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery where there is a potentially high risk from blood transfusion complications
This risk should be carefully weighted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e. g. if you are obese or have a history of thrombotic vascular events (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
heart, heart attack, cerebral haemorrhages, stroke, temporary disturbance of blood perfusion in the brain, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, dilatation of the wall of a blood vessel (aneurysm), retinal thrombosis, and blood clot in an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietin treatment.

The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements: • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) • That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increased with the subcutaneous (sc) route. • There is insufficient data on Epoetin alfa HEXAL to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with sc use • Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CKD • The loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
Epoetin Alfa Hexal is used in the following situations: • to treat anaemia (low red blood cell counts) that is causing symptoms in patients with ‘ chronic renal failure’ (long-term, progressive decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or other kidney problems; • to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusions; • to increase the amount of blood that can be taken in adult patients with moderate anaemia who are going to have an operation and donate their own blood before surgery (autologous blood transfusion); • to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults with mild anaemia who are about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery, such as hip surgery.
2/ 3 • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia (reduced or stopped red blood cell production) following treatment with any erythropoietin; • patients with high blood pressure that is not controlled; • patients who are going to donate their own blood who have had a heart attack of stroke within the last month, who have angina pectoris (a severe type of chest pain) or who are at risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT: formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body, usually in the leg); • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots; • patients about to undergo major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke.

It should also not be used in the following groups: • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia (reduced or stopped red blood cell production) following treatment with any erythropoietin; • patients with hypertension (high blood pressure) that is not controlled; • patients about to undergo surgery who have severe cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke; • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots.
− Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients: o Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in adult and paediatric patients on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4). o Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4). − Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy). − Silapo can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.
If the haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times per week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
− Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. − Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin must not receive Silapo or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4). − Uncontrolled hypertension. − In the indication "increasing the yield of autologous blood": myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease. − Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy, defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1-2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate, or Vitamin B12-deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss, and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 12 g/ dl (7,5 mmol/ l), the dose adjustment detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk of thrombotic events (see section 4.2).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoietic agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with Silapo) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown: • shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l), • shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12-14 g/ dl (7.5 -8.7 mmol/ l),
Thrombotic/vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.

In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e.g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Silapo must not be used if • The blister sealing is broken or the blister is damaged in any way. • The liquid is coloured or you can see particles floating in it. • Any liquid has leaked out of the pre-filled syringe or condensation is visible within the sealed blister. • It may have been accidentally frozen.

− Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. − Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin must not receive Silapo or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4). − Uncontrolled hypertension. − In the indication "increasing the yield of autologous blood": myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease. − Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy, defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1-2 g/dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e.g. iron, folate, or Vitamin B12-deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss, and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 12 g/dl (7,5 mmol/l), the dose adjustment detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk of thrombotic events (see section 4.2).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoietic agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with Silapo) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e.g. deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have shown: • shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl (8.7 mmol/l), • shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5 -8.7 mmol/l),
Thrombotic/vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastrointestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e.g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:

The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements: • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) • That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is increased with the subcutaneous route. • There is insufficient data on Silapo to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with subcutaneous use • Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CRF • Loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA

The most common side effects with Isentress (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are insomnia (difficulty sleeping), dizziness, headache, abdominal distension (bloating), abdominal (tummy) pain, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence (gas), nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), night sweats, pruritus (itching), rash, arthralgia (joint pain), asthenia (weakness), fatigue (tiredness) and increased blood levels of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), triglycerides (a type of fat), creatinine kinase (an enzyme found in muscles) and lipase (an enzyme found in the pancreas).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Isentress’ s benefits, when taken in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, outweigh its risks for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adult patients with evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy.
On 17 May 2006, CIS bio international has officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that they wish to withdraw their application for a marketing authorisation for SCINTIMUN, for diagnostic imaging to determine the location of infectious or inflammatory lesions and to detect metastases (when cancer spreads) in bone marrow.

It contains the following active substances: toxoids (chemically weakened toxins) from diphtheria and tetanus, parts of Bordetella pertussis (a bacterium that causes whooping cough), parts of the hepatitis B virus, inactivated (killed) polioviruses and polysaccharides (sugars) from the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae type b (‘ Hib’, a bacterium that causes meningitis).
Infanrix Hexa contains small amounts of: • toxoids from the bacteria that cause diphtheria and tetanus; • toxoids and other proteins purified from B. pertussis; • surface antigen (proteins from the surface) of the hepatitis B virus; • inactivated polioviruses (types 1, 2 and 3); • polysaccharides extracted from the ‘ capsules’ that surround the Hib bacteria.
Infanrix Hexa is a combination of components that have been available in the European Union (EU) in other vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B were available in Infanrix HepB from 1997 until 2005, and diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polioviruses and the Hib component are available in other vaccines.
The most common side effects with Infanrix Hexa (seen in more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) are loss of appetite, fever of 38ºC or more, local swelling, pain and redness at the injection site, fatigue (tiredness), abnormal crying, irritability and restlessness.
Infanrix Hexa should not be used in infants who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to any of the active substances, to any of the other ingredients of the vaccine, or to neomycin and polymyxin (antibiotics), or if the infant has had an allergic reaction after a previous vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio or Hib.
When Infanrix hexa is co-administered with Prevenar (pneumococcal saccharide conjugated vaccine, adsorbed), the physician should be aware that data from clinical studies indicate that the rate of febrile reactions was higher compared to that occurring following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone.
In clinical studies in which some of the vaccinees received Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar as a booster (4th) dose of both vaccines, fever ≥ 38.0°C was reported following 43.4% of doses in infants receiving Prevenar and Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 30.5% of doses in infants receiving the hexavalent vaccine alone.
Very common: fever ≥ 38°C, local swelling at the injection site (≤ 50 mm), fatigue, pain, redness Common: fever > 39.5°C, injection site reactions, including induration, local swelling at the injection site (> 50 mm)*, injection site reaction Uncommon: diffuse swelling of the injected limb, sometimes involving the adjacent joint*

The most common side effects (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are confusion, dizziness, nystagmus (uncontrolled eye movement), impaired memory (forgetfulness), headache, somnolence (sleepiness), blurred vision, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, abnormal gait (difficulty walking) and asthenia (weakness).
Based on very limited clinical investigations, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (e. g., benazepril, lisinopril and moexipril) and HIV protease inhibitors (e. g., ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir), have no readily apparent effect on plasma ziconotide exposure.
Adding IT ziconotide to stable doses of IT morphine (see section 5.1), is possible but requires special attention, as a high rate of neuropsychiatric adverse events (confusion/ thinking abnormal, paranoid reactions and hallucinations, and abnormal gait), some of them serious, was observed in Study 202 despite a low dose of ziconotide.
The most commonly reported ADRs reported in long-term clinical trials were dizziness (42%), nausea (30%), nystagmus (23%), confusional state (25%), gait abnormal (16%), memory impairment (13%), vision blurred (14%), headache (12%), asthenia (13%), vomiting (11%), and somnolence (10%).
Common: dysarthria, amnesia, dysgeusia, tremor, balance impaired, ataxia, aphasia, burning sensation, sedation, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, disturbance in attention, speech disorder, areflexia, coordination abnormal, dizziness postural, cognitive disorder, hyperaesthesia, hyporeflexia, ageusia, depressed level of consciousness, dysaesthesia, parosmia, mental impairment
In one clinical study a male cancer patient received an accidental IT ziconotide overdose of 744 μ g over a 24-hour period (31 μ g/ hour) and resumed treatment at the intended dose after experiencing a reduction in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) from 82 to 2.5 mm.
In some patients who received intrathecal doses greater than the maximum recommended dose, exaggerated pharmacological effects, e. g., ataxia, nystagmus, dizziness, stupor, depressed level of consciousness, muscle spasms, confusional state, sedation, hypotension, aphasia, speech disorder, nausea and vomiting were observed.
Responders were defined as those patients who 1) experienced a ≥ 30% drop in VASPI score compared to baseline; 2) had stable or decreased concomitant opioid analgesics; and 3) had opiate type unchanged from preinfusion if receiving opiates. b 164 patients provided VASPI scores for ziconotide at the end of titration.
The aetiologies of pain in studies 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non-malignant pain) were varied and included bone pain (n = 38) mostly due to bone metastases (n = 34), myelopathy (n = 38), half of whom had spinal cord injury with paralysis (n = 19), neuropathy (n = 79), radiculopathy (n = 24), spinal pain (n = 91) mostly due to failed back surgery (n = 82), and other aetiologies (n = 82).
Clinical studies 201 and 202 indicate that the combination of IT ziconotide and IT morphine may effectively reduce pain and decrease systemic opioid use over a sustained period of time for patients whose pain was inadequately controlled with their maximum tolerated dose of IT ziconotide (median 8.7 μ g/ day, mean 25.7 μ g/ day – study 201) or with IT morphine (study 202) alone.

Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women with no other risk factors for VTE who use low dose oestrogen (< 50 micrograms ethinyl estradiol) combined contraceptives ranges from about 20 to 40 cases per 100,000 women-years, but this risk estimate varies according to the type of progestagen.
Biochemical factors that may be indicative of hereditary or acquired predisposition for venous or arterial thrombosis include Activated Protein C (APC) resistance, hyper homocysteinaemia, antithrombin-III deficiency, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant).
This has been established with hydantoins, barbiturates, primidone, carbamazepine and rifampicin; bosentan, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, felbamate, ritonavir, griseofulvin, modafinil and phenyl butazone are also suspected.

In a study comparing EVRA to an oral contraceptive containing norgestimate (parent drug of norelgestromin) 250 µg/ ethinyl estradiol 35 µg, Cmax values were 2-fold higher for NGMN and EE in subjects administered the oral contraceptive compared to EVRA, while overall exposure (AUC and Css) was comparable in subjects treated with EVRA.
Data for combination of norgestimate (precursor of norelgestromin) with ethinyl estradiol indicate for female animals a decrease in fertility and implantation efficiency (rat), an increase in foetal resorption (rat, rabbit) and, with high dosages, a decrease in viability and fertility of female offspring (rat).
Do not use EVRA if: • You are allergic (hypersensitive) to norelgestromin, ethinyl estradiol or any of the other ingredients in EVRA (listed in Section 7 below) • You have ever had a heart attack or a type of chest pain called ‘ angina’ • You have ever had a stroke or signs which may lead to stroke.
This includes a slight, temporary stroke, without any after effects • You have high blood pressure (160/ 100 mmHg or above) • You have diabetes with damaged blood vessels • You have bad headaches with neurological symptoms such as changes in vision or numbness in any part of your body (migraine with focal aura) • You have ever had a blood clot (thrombosis) in your legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism) or another part of your body • You have an illness which runs in your family which affects the clotting of your blood (called ‘ protein C deficiency’ or ‘ protein S deficiency’) • You have very high fat levels in your blood (cholesterol or triglycerides) • You have an illness which runs in your family which affects fat levels in your blood (called dyslipoproteinemia) • You have ever had liver tumours or any problem with your liver • You have ever been told you might have breast cancer or cancer of the womb, cervix or vagina • You have unexplained vaginal bleeding.
Tell your doctor if you are taking: • Medicines for HIV infection such as ritonavir • Medicines for infection such as ampicillin, rifampicin, griseofulvin and tetracycline • Medicines for epilepsy such as topiramate, barbiturates, phenyl butazone, phenytoin sodium, carbamazepine, primidone, hydantoins, oxcarbamazepine and felbamate • Bosentan - used for high blood pressure in the lung arteries (pulmonary arterial hypertension) • Modafinil - used for enhancing mood • St.
This is called a ‘ pulmonary embolism’ or PE • Very rarely, blood clots can form in the blood vessels of the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke) • In extremely rare cases, blood clots can happen in other places such as the liver, gut, kidney or eye.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any possible signs of a blood clot, such as: • Pain or swelling in either leg • Pain in the chest, which may spread to the arm • Sudden shortness of breath or sudden coughing • Unusual, severe or long-lasting headache • Vision problems • Difficulty speaking • Feeling dizzy or fainting spells
Your chance of getting a blood clot increases: • As you get older • If blood clots in blood vessels (veins or arteries) runs in the family • If you smoke, especially if you are over 35 years of age • If you stay in bed for many days • If you are very overweight • If you have just had a baby, miscarriage or abortion • If you have had a serious injury, particularly of the leg or hip • If you have had or are going to have a major operation or need to have bed rest for a long time.
Normally you should not use EVRA for two weeks before or two weeks after surgery • If you have ever had blood clots before • If you have problems with your blood fats (cholesterol or triglycerides) • If you have high blood pressure • If you have heart problems (problems with heart valves, abnormal heart rhythm).
Always use EVRA exactly as described in this leaflet. • If you do not, you may increase your risk of getting pregnant • Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure • Always keep non-hormonal contraceptives (such as condoms, foam or sponge) as a back-up in case you make a mistake when using the patch.
Everyday activities while using the patches • Normal activities such as having a bath or shower, using a sauna and exercising should not affect how well the patch works • The patch is designed to stay in place during these types of activities • However, you should check that the patch has not fallen off after doing these activities.
If you need to place the patch on a new area on your body on a day other than your “Patch Change Day” If the patch causes irritation or you become uncomfortable wearing it: • You can take it off and replace it with a new patch in a different place on your body until your next “Patch Change Day” • You may only use one patch at a time.
If your patch becomes loose, lifts at the edges or falls off For less than one day (up to 24 hours): • Try to put it on again or put on a new patch immediately • Back-up contraception is not needed • Your “Patch Change Day” should remain the same • Do not try to put a patch back on if:
For more than one day (24 hours or more) or if you are not sure for how long: • Start a new four week cycle immediately by putting on a new patch • You now have a new Day 1 and a new “Patch Change Day” • You must use non-hormonal contraception as back up for the first week of your new cycle.
If you forget to put on your patch, you may be at particularly high risk of becoming pregnant. • You must use non-hormonal contraception as back up for one week • Put on the first patch of your new cycle as soon as you remember • You now have a new “Patch Change Day” and new Day 1.
For more than 2 days (48 hours or more): • If you forget to change your patch for more than 2 days, you may become pregnant • You must start a new four week cycle as soon as you remember by putting on a new patch • You now have a different “Patch Change Day” and a new Day 1 • You must use back-up contraception for the first week of your new cycle.
If you have absent or irregular bleeding with EVRA EVRA may cause unexpected vaginal bleeding or spotting during the weeks when you are wearing the patch • This usually stops after the first few cycles • Mistakes in using your patches can also cause spotting and light bleeding • Continue using EVRA and if the bleeding lasts more than the first three cycles, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
If you do not get your period during the EVRA patch-free week (Week 4), you should still use a new patch on your usual “Patch Change Day”. • If you have been using EVRA correctly and you do not have a period, this does not necessarily mean that you are pregnant • However, if you miss two periods in a row, talk to your doctor or pharmacist as you may be pregnant.
Common side effects (affects less than 1 in 10 women): • Vaginal yeast infection, sometimes called thrush • Mood problems such as depression, change in mood or mood swings • Feeling dizzy • Migraine • Stomach pain or bloating • Being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea • Acne, skin itching or skin irritation • Muscle spasms • Breast pain or enlargement • Uterine cramps, painful or heavy periods, bleeding between periods or vaginal discharge • Problems where the patch has been on the skin (such as redness, irritation, itching or rash) • Feeling tired or generally unwell • Weight gain.
Uncommon side effects (affects less than 1 in 100): • Swelling due to water retention in the body • High levels of fats in the blood (such as cholesterol or triglycerides) • Uncontrollable emotions • Anxiety • Problems sleeping (insomnia) • Less interest in sex • Skin rash, redness of the skin • Swelling of the breasts, lumps in the breast or abnormal breast milk production • Premenstrual syndrome • Vaginal bleeding or dryness • Problems where the patch has been on the skin (such as swelling, discoloured skin, pain, spots, blisters or the skin feeling over-sensitive) • Swelling • Rise in blood pressure.
Other side effects include: • Other problems where the patch has been on the skin, skin reactions or allergic reactions • Non-cancerous (benign) tumours in your breast or liver • Breast, cervical or liver cancer • Fibroids in the womb (uterus) • Abnormal blood sugar, cholesterol or insulin levels • Blood clots, blocked arteries, heart attack or stroke • Problems when wearing contact lenses • High blood pressure • Inflammation of the colon • Gallstones or blockage of the bile duct • Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes • Hair loss • Sensitivity to sunlight • Less frequent, light or no periods • Anger, feeling irritable or frustrated.

In two studies, Evra was compared with combined oral contraceptives: in one study, the comparator was a ‘ monophasic’ contraceptive (pills containing constant amounts of the active substances over the first three weeks of the treatment cycle) and in the other study, they were ‘ triphasic’ (with the amount of the active substances in the pills varying through the treatment cycle).
It should not be used when a woman has, or has had, venous or arterial thrombosis (blood clots in the veins or arteries) including a stroke or a heart attack or when a woman has some of the risk factors for thrombosis (severe high blood pressure, diabetes with damage to the blood vessels, high cholesterol levels, or a family history of thrombosis).

VFEND should not be used in patients who are taking any of the following medicines: • Terfenadine, astemizole (used for allergy) • Cisapride (used for stomach problems) • Pimozide (used to treat mental illnesses) • Quinidine (used for irregular heart beat) • Rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) • Carbamazepine (used to treat seizures) • Phenobarbital (used for severe insomnia and seizures) • Ergot alkaloids (e. g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine; used for migraine) • Sirolimus (used in transplant patients) • Efavirenz (used to treat HIV infection) • Ritonavir (used to treat HIV infection) in doses of 400 mg or more twice daily Caution is also needed when VFEND is taken at the same time as other medicines, see the Package Leaflet for full details.
Coadministration of the CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with VFEND is contraindicated since increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5).
 Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation  Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present  Sinus bradycardia  Existing symptomatic arrhythmias  Concomitant medication that is known to prolong QT interval Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored and corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.2).
High doses of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) decreased the steady state Cmax and AUCτ of oral voriconazole by an average of 66% and 82%, whereas low doses of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the Cmax and AUCτ of voriconazole by an average of 24% and 39% respectively.
Administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on mean Cmax and AUCτ of ritonavir in the high dose study, although a minor decrease in steady state Cmax and AUCτ of ritonavir with an average of 25% and 13% respectively was observed in the low dose ritonavir interaction study.
Although not studied, coadministration of voriconazole with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, or quinidine is contraindicated, since increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.3).
In subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (32-100 mg once daily) coadministration of oral voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for four days) increased the Cmax and AUC of pharmacologically active R-methadone by 31% and 47%, respectively, whereas the Cmax and AUC of the S-enantiomer increased by approximately 65% and 103%, respectively.
Phenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased to 5 mg/ kg intravenously twice daily or from 200 mg to 400 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg), see section 4.2.
If rifabutin coadministration with voriconazole is justified then the maintenance dose of voriconazole may be increased to 5 mg/ kg intravenously twice daily or from 200 mg to 350 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg) (see section 4.2).
Coadministration of voriconazole and an oral contraceptive (1 mg norethisterone and 0.035 mg ethinylestradiol; once daily) in healthy female subjects resulted in increases in the Cmax and AUCτ of ethinylestradiol (36% and 61% respectively) and norethisterone (15% and 53% respectively).
Standard doses of voriconazole and standard doses of efavirenz must not be coadministered Steady-state efavirenz (400 mg orally once daily) decreased the steady state Cmax and AUCτ of voriconazole by an average of 61% and 77%, respectively, in healthy subjects.
Mechanism of action In vitro, voriconazole displays broad-spectrum antifungal activity with antifungal potency against Candida species (including fluconazole resistant C. krusei and resistant strains of C. glabrata and C. albicans) and fungicidal activity against all Aspergillus species tested.
Microbiology Clinical efficacy (with partial or complete response, see below under Clinical Experience) has been demonstrated for Aspergillus spp. including A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. niger, A. nidulans, Candida spp., including C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis and limited numbers of C. dubliniensis, C. inconspicua, and C. guilliermondii, Scedosporium spp., including S. apiospermum, S. prolificans and Fusarium spp.
Other treated fungal infections (with often partial or complete response) included isolated cases of Alternaria spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Cladosporium spp., Coccidioides immitis, Conidiobolus coronatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Exserohilum rostratum, Exophiala spinifera, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Madurella mycetomatis, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Penicillium spp. including P. marneffei, Phialophora richardsiae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Trichosporon spp. including T. beigelii infections.
During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk of aspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or haematopoietic tissue), the observed pharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid and consistent absorption, accumulation and non- linear pharmacokinetics were in agreement with those observed in healthy subjects.
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic relationships In 10 therapeutic studies, the median for the average and maximum plasma concentrations in individual subjects across the studies was 2425 ng/ ml (inter-quartile range 1193 to 4380 ng/ ml) and 3742 ng/ ml (inter-quartile range 2027 to 6302 ng/ ml), respectively.
Paediatric The recommended oral dose in paediatrics is based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data obtained from 47 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years old who were evaluated in a pharmacokinetic study examining multiple oral suspension doses of 4 and 6 mg/ kg twice daily.
19 Renal impairment In an oral single dose (200 mg) study in subjects with normal renal function and mild (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/ min) to severe (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/ min) renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment.
Coadministration of the CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with VFEND is contraindicated since increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5).

Other treated fungal infections (with often partial or complete response, see below under Clinical Experience) included isolated cases of Alternaria spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Blastoschizomyces capitatus, Cladosporium spp., Coccidioides immitis, Conidiobolus coronatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Exserohilum rostratum, Exophiala spinifera, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Madurella mycetomatis, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Penicillium spp. including P. marneffei, Phialophora richardsiae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Trichosporon spp. including T. beigelii infections.
During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk of aspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or haematopoietic tissue), the observed pharmacokinetic characteristics of rapid and consistent absorption, accumulation and non- linear pharmacokinetics were in agreement with those observed in healthy subjects.
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic relationships In 10 therapeutic studies, the median for the average and maximum plasma concentrations in individual subjects across the studies was 2425 ng/ ml (inter-quartile range 1193 to 4380 ng/ ml) and 3742 ng/ ml (inter-quartile range 2027 to 6302 ng/ ml), respectively.
Paediatrics The recommended intravenous dose in paediatric patients is based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data pooled from 82 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years old who were evaluated in three pharmacokinetic studies (examining single intravenous doses of 3 and 4 mg/ kg twice daily, multiple intravenous doses of 3, 4, 6 and 8 mg/ kg twice daily and multiple oral suspension doses of 4 and 6 mg/ kg twice daily).

Coadministration of the CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with VFEND is contraindicated since increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.5).
Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as  Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation  Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present  Sinus bradycardia  Existing symptomatic arrhythmias  Concomitant medication that is known to prolong QT interval Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be monitored and corrected, if necessary, prior to initiation and during voriconazole therapy (see section 4.2).
High doses of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) decreased the steady state Cmax and AUCτ of oral voriconazole by an average of 66% and 82%, whereas low doses of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the Cmax and AUCτ of voriconazole by an average of 24% and 39% respectively.
Administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on mean Cmax and AUCτ of ritonavir in the high dose study, although a minor decrease in steady state Cmax and AUCτ of ritonavir with an average of 25% and 13% respectively was observed in the low dose ritonavir interaction study.
Although not studied, coadministration of voriconazole with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, or quinidine is contraindicated, since increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products can lead to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see section 4.3).
In subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (32-100 mg once daily) coadministration of oral voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for four days) increased the Cmax and AUC of pharmacologically active R-methadone by 31% and 47%, respectively, whereas the Cmax and AUC of the S-enantiomer increased by approximately 65% and 103%, respectively.
If rifabutin coadministration with voriconazole is justified then the maintenance dose of voriconazole may be increased to 5 mg/ kg intravenously twice daily or from 200 mg to 350 mg orally, twice daily (100 mg to 200 mg orally, twice daily in patients less than 40 kg) (see section 4.2).
Coadministration of voriconazole and an oral contraceptive (1 mg norethisterone and 0.035 mg ethinylestradiol; once daily) in healthy female subjects resulted in increases in the Cmax and AUCτ of ethinylestradiol (36% and 61% respectively) and norethisterone (15% and 53% respectively).
In the table below, since the majority of the studies were of an open nature all causality adverse events, by system organ class and frequency (very common ≥ 1/ 10, common ≥ 1/ 100 and < 1/ 10, uncommon ≥ 1/ 1000 and < 1/ 100, rare, ≥ 1/ 10 000 and < 1/ 1000 and very rare, < 1/ 10 000) if possibly causally related are listed.
In the 22 patients less than 2 years old who received voriconazole in a compassionate use programme, the following adverse events (for which a relationship to voriconazole could not be excluded) were reported: photosensitivity reaction (1), arrhythmia (1), pancreatitis (1), blood bilirubin increased (1), hepatic enzymes increased (1), rash (1) and papilloedema (1).

Paediatric The recommended oral dose in paediatrics is based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data obtained from 47 immunocompromised paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years old who were evaluated in a pharmacokinetic study examining multiple oral suspension doses of 4 and 6 mg/ kg twice daily.
Renal impairment In an oral single dose (200 mg) study in subjects with normal renal function and mild (creatinine clearance 41-60 ml/ min) to severe (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/ min) renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment.

It must not be used in women whose pregnancy is less than 24 weeks or more than 33 weeks, or who have premature rupture of the membranes, bleeding from the womb, eclampsia (a dangerous condition at the end of pregnancy caused by toxins in the blood), pre-eclampsia (a condition that can lead to eclampsia) or problems with the placenta.
INOmax, in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents, is indicated for the treatment of newborns ≥ 34 weeks gestation with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension, in order to improve oxygenation and to reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
In the presence of oxygen, nitric oxide is rapidly oxidised to derivatives which are toxic to the bronchial epithelium and alveolo-capillary membrane. nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is the main compound formed, and during treatment with nitric oxide, the NO2 concentration should be < 0.5 ppm in the nitric oxide dose range < 20 ppm.
In one clinical study (NINOS), treatment groups were similar with respect to the incidence and severity of intracranial haemorrhage, Grade IV haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, cerebral infarction, seizures requiring anticonvulsant therapy, pulmonary haemorrhage, or gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
In the CINRGI trial, 186 term- and near-term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure were randomised to receive either INOmax (n=97) or nitrogen gas (placebo; n=89) with an initial dose of 20 ppm weaning to 5 ppm in 4 to 24 hours with median duration of exposure of 44 hours.

In the other two studies, the medicines were used as an add-on to existing treatment including methotrexate: one study, which involved 419 patients, used a range of doses of Kineret that depended on the patient’ s weight, and the other study, which involved 501 patients, used Kineret at a fixed dose of 100 mg once a day.
Comtess should not be used in patients with: • liver disease; • phaeochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland); • a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a dangerous nervous system disorder usually caused by antipsychotic medicines) or rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle fibres).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Comtess’ s benefits are greater than its risks as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/ benserazide or levodopa/ carbidopa for use in patients with Parkinson’ s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.
NMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e. g. agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase.
Thus, entacapone should be administered cautiously to patients being treated with medicinal products metabolised by catechol-O- methyl transferase (COMT), e. g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine (see also section 4.5).
However, the experience of the clinical use of entacapone with several medicinal products, including MAO-A inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline and venlafaxine, and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e. g. catechol-structured compounds: rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha- methyldopa, apomorphine, and paroxetine) is still limited.
Patients being treated with entacapone in association with levodopa and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see also section 4.4).
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical trials or epidemiological studies).
Parkinson’ s disease patients treated with dopamine agonists and other dopaminergic treatments such as entacapone in association with levodopa, especially at high doses, have been reported as exhibiting signs of pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality, which were generally reversible upon reduction of the dose or treatment discontinuation.
Do not take Comtess – if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to entacapone or any of the other ingredients of Comtess; – if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as pheochromocytoma; this may increase the risk of severe high blood pressure); – if you are taking certain antidepressants (ask your doctor or pharmacist whether your antidepressive medicine can be taken together with Comtess); – if you have liver disease; – if you have ever suffered from a rare reaction to antipsychotic medicines called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/ or a rare muscle disorder called non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis.
Very common (affects more than 1 patient in 10) Common (affects 1 to 10 patients in 100) Uncommon (affects 1 to 10 patients in 1,000) Rare (affects 1 to 10 patients in 10,000) Very rare (affects less than 1 patient in 10,000) Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Common Uncontrollable movements (hyperkinesias), being sick (vomiting), worsening of symptoms of Parkinson’ s disease, dizziness, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, hallucinations (seeing/ hearing/ feeling/ smelling things that are not really there), prolonged muscle contractions (dystonia), tiredness, increased sweating, sleeplessness, vivid dreams, fall and confusion.
ZIMULTI is used together with diet and exercise to treat adult patients: • who are obese (very overweight) with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/ m², • who are overweight (with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/ m²) and also have other risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of fat in their blood).
6 Post-Marketing In addition the following adverse reactions were reported during postmarketing (frequency not known): − Psychiatric disorder: psychotic disorders including hallucinations, delusion and paranoia. − Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash. − Nervous disorders: convulsions, disturbance in attention, headache. − gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain.
In a second trial in treatment naïve type 2 diabetic obese patients (Serenade), the absolute change in HbA1c (with a baseline of 7.9% for both groups) at six months was -0.8 for rimonabant 20 mg and -0.3 under placebo (Difference -0.51 CI95% -0.78, -0.24 p < 0.001).
Taking other medicines The activity of ZIMULTI is increased by simultaneous use of some drugs (so-called CYP3A4 inhibitors) such as: − itraconazole (antifungal medicine) − ketoconazole (antifungal medicine) − ritonavir (medicine for the treatment of HIV infections) − telithromycin (antibiotic)
Uncommon side effects, that affect less than 1 per 100 but more than1 per 1000, that have occurred in patients on ZIMULTI include: ra Sleepiness (lethargy), tremor, night sweats, panic symptoms, hiccups, anger, restlessness (dysphoria), ge emotional disorder, suicidal thoughts, aggressiveness or aggressive behaviour, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). on

− Hypersensitivity to thalidomide or to any of the excipients. − Pregnant women (see section 4.6). − Women of childbearing potential unless all the conditions of the Thalidomide Celgene Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). − Patients unable to follow or comply with the required contraceptive measures (see section 4.4).
A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential unless she meets at least one of the following criteria: • Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year*. • Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist. • Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy. • XY genotype, Turner’ s syndrome, uterine agenesis. *Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential.
For women of childbearing potential, thalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met: • She understands the teratogenic risk to the unborn child • She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks before starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and 4 weeks after the end of treatment • Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on effective contraception • She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures • She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy • She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as thalidomide is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test • She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing every 4 weeks • She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of thalidomide.
As thalidomide is found in semen, male patients taking thalidomide must meet the following conditions: • Understand the teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman. • Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.
4 The following can be considered to be examples of effective methods of contraception: • Subcutaneous hormonal implant • Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) • Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot • Tubal sterilisation • Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative semen analyses • Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i. e., desogestrel)
Thalidomide is a powerful human teratogen, inducing a high frequency (about 30%) of severe and live-threatening birth defects such as: ectromelia (amelia, phocomelia, hemimelia) of the upper and/ or lower extremities, microtia with abnormality of the external acoustic meatus (blind or absent), middle
The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone are: neutropenia, leukopenia, constipation, somnolence, paraesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, dysaesthesia, tremor and peripheral oedema.
The clinically important adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone or dexamethasone include: deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reactions including Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, syncope, bradycardia, and dizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5).
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)).
In addition to the adverse reactions outlined above thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in other clinical studies led to the very common adverse reaction of fatigue; common adverse reactions of transient ischaemic event, syncope, vertigo, hypotension, mood altered, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea and dyspepsia; and uncommon adverse reactions of cerebrovascular accident, diverticular perforation, peritonitis, orthostatic hypotension and bronchitis.
Data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects of thalidomide may be related to suppression of excessive tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production, down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration and anti-angiogenic activity.

The most common side effects (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), leucopenia (low white blood cell counts), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), lymphopenia (low levels of lymphocytes, another type of white blood cell), thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets in the blood), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage causing tingling, pain and numbness in the hands and feet), tremor (shaking), dizziness, paraesthesia (unusual sensations like pins and needles), dysaesthesia (reduced sense of touch), somnolence (sleepiness), constipation and peripheral oedema (swelling, usually in the legs).
Thalidomide Celgene must never be used by the following groups:  women who are pregnant;  women who could become pregnant, unless they take all of the necessary steps to ensure that they are not pregnant before treatment and that they do not become pregnant during or soon after treatment;  patients who are unable to follow or to comply with the requirement to use contraceptives.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, provided that very strict measures are put in place to avoid exposure of unborn children to thalidomide, Thalidomide Celgene’ s benefits are greater than its risks, in combination with melphalan and prednisone as first line treatment of patients with untreated multiple myeloma, aged greater than or equal to 65 years or ineligible for high dose chemotherapy.
However, the following side effects are seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 1,000: hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels), syncope (fainting), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), vertigo (a spinning sensation), hypotension (low blood pressure), dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, dry mouth, dyspepsia (heartburn), flatulence (gas), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), pruritus (itching), myalgia (muscle pain), renal impairment (kidney problems) including renal failure (kidney failure), and chest pain.

In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.
The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti- inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
In preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals.

On 9 September 2008, Pfizer Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for EXULETT, for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in adults when known or suspected to be caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria.
EXULETT was to be used to treat adults with complicated infections of the skin and the ‘ soft tissues’ below the skin. ‘ Complicated’ means that the infection is difficult to treat, because it has spread to the deep tissues below the skin, treatment with surgery might be needed, or the patient has other conditions that might affect the response to treatment.
Based on the review of the data and the company’ s response to the CHMP list of questions at the time of the withdrawal, the CHMP had some concerns and was of the provisional opinion that EXULETT could not have been approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in adults when known or suspected to be caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria.
The immunogenicity of the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of CELVAPAN (strain A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004) has been evaluated in two clinical studies in adults aged 18 – 59 years (N=312) and in elderly subjects aged 60 years and older (N=272) following a 0, 21 day schedule.
In a dose-finding study in adults aged 18 – 45 years investigating various dose levels of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations of the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 strain vaccine the rates of subjects with 6 neutralising antibody titres > 20, seroconversion rates and seroconversion factor for cross-neutralising antibodies as measured by MN in subjects who received the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation (N=42) were as follows:
Antibody persistence after vaccination with the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of CELVAPAN (strain A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004) has been evaluated in two clinical studies in adults aged 18 – 59 years (N=285) and in one clinical study in elderly subjects aged 60 years and above (N=258) up to 6 months after the start of the primary vaccination series.
Seroprotective titres as determined by SRH assay against the homologous vaccine strain (A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004) were observed in 65.5% of subjects aged 18 – 59 years and in 59.4% of subjects aged 60 years and older at 21 days after a booster vaccination with the 7.5 μ g dose of the A/ Vietnam strain vaccine.
Another study investigated a booster vaccination with 7.5 μ g of the heterologous A/ Indonesia/ 05/ 2005 vaccine strain administered 12 – 15 months after an initial 2-dose priming with various dose levels of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations of the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 strain vaccine in subjects aged 18 – 45 years.
In subjects who received the 7.5 μ g non-adjuvanted formulation for primary vaccination (N = 12) seroprotection rates as measured by SRH 21 days after the booster vaccination were 66.7% and 83.3%, and 100% and 91.7% of subjects achieved neutralising antibody titres > 20 when tested against the homologous A/ Indonesia and the heterologous A/ Vietnam strain, respectively.
The A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced by full survivorship, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain and olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals.
Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version RMP V 2.0 (dated 14 Aug 2008) of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
11 In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
A minor infection such as a cold should not be problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be vaccinated with CELVAPAN. • if you have a poor immune response (as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, e. g. corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer);
You should be aware that the side effects may be intensified. • If you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment (such as radiotherapy) that affects the immune system, CELVAPAN can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor. • CELVAPAN should not be given at the same time as immunoglobulins.
The frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (affects more than 1 user in 10) common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) 21 uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Common: • runny nose and sore throat, • headache, dizziness, vertigo (motion sickness) • sweating more than usual, • joint or muscle pain, • chills, fatigue (feeling tired), malaise (generally feeling unwell), fever, • tissue hardening, redness, swelling or bruising at the injection site
Uncommon: • swollen glands, • insomnia (difficulty sleeping), restlessness, • impaired perception of touch, pain, heat and cold, sleepiness, • conjunctivitis (an inflammation of the eye), • sudden hearing loss, • reduced blood pressure, • shortness of breath, cough, congestion of the nose, • nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, • rash, itching, • irritation at the injection site
Very rare: • Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) with s transient kidney problems • Inflammation of the brain and spinal chord (encephalomyelitis) • Temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness and paralysis in the extremities and often progressing to the chest and face
The study looked at the ability of two 7.5-microgram doses of Celvapan, given 21 days apart, to trigger the production of antibodies (‘ immunogenicity’). The main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies against the flu virus in the blood before vaccination, on the day of the second injection (day 21), and 21 days after the second vaccination (day 42).

The results of the main measures of effectiveness (the number of patients in whom treatment had been successful and the average time to the failure of treatment) were not available at the time of the assessment, so the company presented information on the change in the levels of HIV in the patients’ blood (viral load) after 24 weeks of treatment.
APTIVUS should not be used in patients with moderate or severe problems with their liver or who are taking any of the following medicines: • rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis), • St John’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression), • medicines that are broken down in the same way as APTIVUS or ritonavir and are harmful at high levels in the blood.
These active substances include antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine), antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (cisapride), neuroleptics (pimozide, sertindole), sedatives/ hypnotics (orally administered midazolam and triazolam.
In addition, co-administration of APTIVUS with low dose ritonavir, with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol given in heart failure, is contraindicated (see section 4.5).
Increased monitoring (i. e. prior to initiation of therapy, every two weeks during the first three months of treatment, then monthly until 48 weeks, and then every eight to twelve weeks thereafter) is warranted when APTIVUS and low dose ritonavir are administered to patients with elevated ASAT and ALAT levels, mild hepatic impairment, chronic hepatitis-B or – C or other underlying liver disease.
In a study performed in antiretroviral naïve patients, APTIVUS/ ritonavir 500/ 200 mg twice daily, as compared to lopinavir/ ritonavir, was associated with an excess in the occurrence of significant (grade 3 and 4) transaminase elevations without any advantage in terms of efficacy (trend towards a lower efficacy).
APTIVUS, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other medical conditions, or who are receiving medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants or who are taking supplemental vitamin E.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Concomitant use of APTIVUS, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with the protease inhibitors amprenavir, lopinavir or saquinavir (each co-administered with low dose ritonavir) in a dual-boosted regimen, results in significant decreases in plasma concentrations of these protease inhibitors.
Concomitant use of APTIVUS, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
The in vivo net effect of tipranavir/ ritonavir on CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19, indicates, through a preliminary study, an inducing potential of APTIVUS/ ritonavir on CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, on CYP2C9 and P-gp after several days of treatment.
Steady-state efavirenz 600 mg qd co-administered with steady-state APTIVUS and low- dose ritonavir (500/ 200 mg bid) did not significantly alter tipranavir AUC and Cmax and increased Cp12h by 19.2% which is not considered as clinically relevant.
In a clinical study of dual-boosted protease inhibitor combination therapy in multiple-treatment experienced HIV-positive adults, APTIVUS, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, caused a 55%, 70% and 78% reduction in the Cmin of amprenavir, lopinavir and saquinavir, respectively.
Therefore the concomitant administration of APTIVUS, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with amprenavir/ ritonavir, lopinavir/ ritonavir or saquinavir/ ritonavir, is not recommended, as the clinical relevance of the reduction in their levels has not been established.
In a study performed in healthy volunteers co-administration of atazanavir 300 mg with TPV/ r 500/ 100 mg bid resulted on one hand in a marked increase of Tipranavir exposure (notably Cp12h ratio of 1.75 with 90% CI [1.39-2.20]) and ritonavir exposure (AUC ratio of 1.51 with 90% CI [1.24- 1.83] and Cmax ratio of 1.38 with 90% CI [1.13-1.67]) associated with a risk of over-toxicity and on the other hand on a marked decrease of atazanavir exposure associated with a risk of loss of efficacy (AUC0-24h ratio of 0.32 with 90% CI [0.29-0.36], Cmax ratio of 0.43 with 90% CI [0.38-0.50] and Cp24h ratio of 0.19 with 90% CI [0.15-0.24]).
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A for metabolism, thus concomitant use of APTIVUS co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with simvastatin or lovastatin are contra-indicated due to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).
These active substances include antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine), antihistamines (astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastointestinal motility agents (cisapride), neuroleptics (pimozide, sertindole) and sedatives/ hypnotics (triazolam) (see section 4.3).
11 In addition, co-administration of APTIVUS with low dose ritonavir, with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol given in heart failure, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Co-administration of APTIVUS and low dose ritonavir with single dose methadone was demonstrated to decrease methadone pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24h ratio of 0.47 with 90% CI [0.44; 0.51] and Cmax ratio of 0.45 with 90% CI [0.41; 0.49]), in a study conducted in fasted healthy subjects.
Concentrations of cyclosporin, tacrolimus, or sirolimus cannot be predicted when co-administered with APTIVUS co-administered with low dose ritonavir, due to conflicting effect of APTIVUS, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, on CYP 3A and Pgp.
In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).
The following clinical safety features (hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidaemia, bleeding events, rash) were seen at higher frequency among APTIVUS/ ritonavir treated patients when compared with the comparator arm treated patients in the RESIST trials, or have been observed with APTIVUS/ ritonavir administration.
Clinically meaningful adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in less than 1% (< 1/ 100) of adult patients in all Phase II and III trials treated with the 500 mg/ 200 mg tipranavir/ ritonavir dose (n=1397) are listed below by system organ class and frequency according to the following categories:
16 Frequencies of marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in at least 2% of patients in the APTIVUS/ ritonavir arms in the phase III clinical studies (RESIST-1 and RESIST-2) after 48-weeks were increased ASAT (6.1%), increased ALAT (9.7%), increased amylase (6.0%), increased cholesterol (4.2%), increased triglycerides (24.9%), and decreased white blood cell count (5.7%).
Tipranavir inhibits the replication of laboratory strains of HIV-1 and clinical isolates in acute models of T-cell infection, with 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50 and EC90) ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 µM (18-42 ng/ ml) and 0.07 to 0.18 µM (42-108 ng/ ml), respectively.
Reverse genetic experiments showed that the presence of 6 mutations in the protease (I13V, V32I, L33F, K45I, V82L, I84V) was required to confer > 10-fold resistance to tipranavir while the full 10-mutation genotype conferred 69-fold resistance to tipranavir.
RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 are ongoing, randomised, open-label, multicentre studies in HIV-positive, triple-class experienced patients, evaluating treatment with APTIVUS co-administered with low dose ritonavir (500 mg/ 200 mg twice daily) plus an optimised background regimen (OBR) individually defined for each patient based on genotypic resistance testing and patient history.
At least one primary protease gene mutation from among 30N, 46I, 46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or 90M had to be present at baseline, with not more than two mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.
In the APTIVUS and comparator arms median baseline CD4 cell counts were 158 and 166 cells/ mm3, respectively, (ranges 1-1893 and 1-1184 cells/ mm3); median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.79 and 4.80 log10 copies/ ml, respectively (ranges 2.34-6.52 and 2.01-6.76 log10 copies/ ml).
Patients had baseline HIV-1 isolates with a median of 16 HIV-1 protease gene mutations, including a median of 3 primary protease gene mutations D30N, L33F/ I, V46I/ L, G48V, I50V, V82A/ F/ T/ L, I84V, and L90M.
There was an average decrease in susceptibility of 2-fold wild type (WT) for tipranavir, 12-fold WT for amprenavir, 55-fold WT for atazanavir, 41-fold WT for indinavir, 87-fold WT for lopinavir, 41- fold WT for nelfinavir, 195-fold WT for ritonavir, and 20-fold WT for saquinavir.

Among all randomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the last measurement up to Week 48 was -0.64 log10 copies/ ml in patients receiving APTIVUS/ ritonavir versus -0.22 log10 copies/ ml in the comparator PI/ ritonavir arm.
19 Among all randomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at the last measurement up to Week 48 was +23 cells/ mm3 in patients receiving APTIVUS/ ritonavir (N=740) versus +4 cells/ mm3 in the comparator PI/ ritonavir (N=727) arm.
Of note, patients in the RESIST studies had a specific mutational pattern at baseline of at least one primary protease gene mutation among codons 30N, 46I, 46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or 90M, and no more than two mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.
10V, 13V, 20M/ R/ V, 33F, 35G, 36I, 43T, 46L, 47V, 54A/ M/ V, 58E, 69K, 74P, 82L/ T, 83D and 84V) was applied to baseline viral protease sequences.

Dosing with APTIVUS 500 mg concomitant with 200 mg ritonavir twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks and without meal restriction produced a mean tipranavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 94.8 ± 22.8 µM for female patients (n=14) and 77.6 ± 16.6 µM for male patients (n=106), occurring approximately 3 hours after administration.
Administration of 14C-tipranavir to subjects (n = 8) that received tipranavir/ ritonavir 500 mg/ 200 mg twice daily dosed to steady-state demonstrated that most radioactivity (median 82.3%) was excreted in faeces, while only a median of 4.4% of the radioactive dose administered was recovered in urine.
The effective mean elimination half-life of tipranavir/ ritonavir in healthy volunteers (n = 67) and HIV- infected adult patients (n = 120) was approximately 4.8 and 6.0 hours, respectively, at steady state following a dose of 500 mg/ 200 mg twice daily with a light meal.
Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 4.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Dossier and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
pimozide or sertindole (used to treat schizophrenia), triazolam or oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders), ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches), astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergies or hay fever), the statins simvastatin or lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) or amioradone, bepridil, flecainide, propafenone or quinidine (used to treat heart disorders), and metoprolol (used to treat heart failure).
Examples include the cholesterol-reducing agent atorvastatin, the antibiotics rifabutin and clarithromycin, the asthma treatment theophylline, the antidepressants desipramine, trazodone and bupropion (also used for smoking cessation), the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, the proton pump inhibitors omeprazole and esomeprazole and sedative agents (e. g. midazolam administered by injection).
Uncommon side effects (which can occur in less than one in a hundred but more than one in a thousand patients treated) are reduction in red and white blood cells, reduction in blood platelets, allergic reactions, decreased appetite, diabetes, increased blood levels of the pancreas enzymes amylase and lipase, increased cholesterol blood levels, sleeplessness and other sleep disorders (including sleepiness), dizziness, numbness and/ or tingling and/ or pain in the feet or hands, breathing difficulties, heartburn, inflammation of the pancreas, skin inflammation, loss or gain of body fat and other changes in fat distribution (see below), muscle cramp, muscle pain, kidney malfunction, flu like symptoms, general feelings of illness, fever and weight loss.
It is used in patients with: • compensated liver disease (when the liver is damaged but functions normally), who also show signs that the virus is still multiplying, and have signs of liver damage (raised levels of the liver enzyme ‘ alanine aminotransferase’ [ALT] and signs of damage when liver tissue is examined under a microscope); • decompensated liver disease (when the liver is damaged and does not function normally).
The first study included 511 patients who were ‘ HBeAg positive ’ (infected with the common type of the hepatitis B virus) and the second included 184 patients who were ‘ HBeAg negative ’ (infected with a virus that has mutated [changed], leading to a form of chronic hepatitis B that is more difficult to treat).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Hepsera’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum ALT levels and histological evidence of active liver inflammation and fibrosis, and in adults with decompensated liver disease.
In HBeAg positive patients, treatment should be administered at least until HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg and HBV DNA loss with HBeAb detection on 2 consecutive serum samples at least 3 months apart) or until HBsAg seroconversion or in case of evidence of loss of efficacy (see section 4.4).
In that case, the limited data available suggest that for patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 29 ml/ min, adefovir dipivoxil (one 10 mg tablet) may be administered every 72 hours; for haemodialysis patients, adefovir dipivoxil (one 10 mg tablet) may be administered every 7 days following 12 hours continuous dialysis (or 3 dialysis sessions, each of 4 hours duration).
Lamivudine-refractory patients and patients harbouring HBV with evidence of resistance to lamivudine (mutations at rtL180M, rtA181T and/ or rtM204I/ V) should not be treated with adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy in order to reduce the risk of resistance to adefovir.
Caution is advised in patients receiving other medicinal products that may affect renal function or are excreted renally (e. g. cyclosporin and tacrolimus, intravenous aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, pentamidine, vancomycin, or medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal transporter, human Organic Anion Transporter 1 (hOAT1), such as cidofovir).
The potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving adefovir with other medicinal products is low, based on the results of in vitro experiments in which adefovir did not influence any of the common CYP isoforms known to be involved in human drug metabolism and based on the known elimination pathway of adefovir.
• two placebo-controlled studies in which 522 patients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received double-blind treatment with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil (n=294) or placebo (n=228) for 48 weeks. • an open-label study in which pre- (n=226) and post-liver transplantation patients (n=241) with lamivudine-resistant HBV were treated with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil once daily, for up to 203 weeks (median 51 and 99 weeks, respectively).
In a long-term safety study of 65 HBeAg positive patients with compensated liver disease (after a median exposure of 234 weeks), 6 patients (9%) had confirmed increases in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg/ dl from baseline with 2 patients discontinuing from the study due to the elevated serum creatinine concentration.
Adefovir is active against hepadnaviruses in vitro, including all common forms of lamivudine-resistant HBV (rtL180M, rtM204I, rtM204V, rtL180M/ rtM204V), famciclovir-associated mutations (rtV173L, rtP177L, rtL180M, rtT184S or rtV207I) and hepatitis B immunoglobulin escape mutations (rtT128N and rtW153Q), and in in vivo animal models of hepadnavirus replication.
In two placebo-controlled studies (total n=522) in HBeAg positive or in HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B patients with compensated liver disease, significantly more patients (p < 0.001) in the 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil groups (53 and 64%, 8 respectively) had histological improvement from baseline at week 48 than in the placebo groups (25 and 33%).
In the two studies mentioned above, treatment with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil was associated with significant reductions in serum HBV DNA (3.52 and 3.91 log10 copies/ ml, respectively, versus 0.55 and 1.35 log10 copies/ ml), increased proportion of patients with normalisation of ALT (48 and 72% versus 16 and 29%) or increased proportion of patients with serum HBV DNA below the limits of quantification (< 400 copies/ ml Roche Amplicor Monitor PCR assay) (21 and 51% versus 0%) when compared with placebo.
In a clinical study in 394 chronic hepatitis B patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV (pre-liver transplantation (n=186) and post-liver transplantation (n=208)), treatment with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil resulted in a median reduction in serum HBV DNA of 4.1 and 4.2 log10 copies/ ml, respectively, at week 48.
In 40 HBeAg positive or HBeAg negative patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV and decompensated liver disease receiving treatment with 100 mg lamivudine, addition of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil treatment for 52 weeks resulted in a median reduction in HBV DNA of 4.6 log10 copies/ ml.
In an open-label investigator study in 35 chronic hepatitis B patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV and co-infected with HIV, continued treatment with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil resulted in progressive reductions in serum HBV DNA levels and ALT levels throughout the course of treatment up to 144 weeks.
Due to the small sample size and the study design, in particular the lack of treatment arms with pegylated interferon alpha-2a monotherapy and with adefovir monotherapy, it is not possible to draw formal conclusions on the best therapeutic management of HIV co-infected patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV.
The efficacy and safety of a daily dose of 0.25 mg/ kg to 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil in children (aged from 2 to < 18 years) was examined in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in 173 paediatric patients (115 on adefovir dipivoxil, 58 on placebo) who had HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B, serum ALT levels ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and compensated liver disease.
In several clinical studies (HBeAg positive, HBeAg negative, pre- and post-liver transplantation with lamivudine-resistant HBV and lamivudine-resistant HBV co-infected with HIV patients), genotypic analyses were conducted on HBV isolates from 379 of a total of 629 patients, treated with adefovir dipivoxil for 48 weeks.
In addition, the long-term (4 to 5 years) development of resistance to adefovir dipivoxil was significantly lower in patients who had serum HBV DNA below the limit of quantification (< 1,000 copies/ ml) at week 48 as compared to patients with serum HBV DNA above 1,000 copies/ ml at week 48.
Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that adefovir exposure was comparable among 3 age groups, 2 to 6 years (0.3 mg/ kg), 7 to 11 years (0.25 mg/ kg) and 12 to 17 years (10 mg) and all age groups achieved adefovir exposure in the target range (for efficacy results see section 5.1), which was based on adefovir plasma concentrations in adult patients with chronic hepatitis B with established safety and efficacy profiles.
When adefovir was administered intravenously to pregnant rats at doses associated with notable maternal toxicity (systemic exposure 38 times that achieved in humans at the therapeutic dose) embryotoxicity and an increased incidence of foetal malformations (anasarca, depressed eye bulge, umbilical hernia and kinked tail) were observed.
The most common side effects when taking Ziagen (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are anorexia (loss of appetite), headache, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, fever, lethargy (lack of energy) and fatigue (tiredness).
Symptoms almost always include fever or rash, but also very commonly include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), cough, fever, lethargy, malaise (feeling unwell), headache, signs of liver damage in the blood and myalgia (muscle pain).
As with all other NRTIs, Ziagen may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Ziagen during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
In populations similar to that enrolled in the PREDICT-1 study, it is estimated that 48% to 61% of patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele will develop a hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 0% to 4% of patients who do not have the HLA-B*5701 allele.
Other signs and symptoms may include respiratory signs and symptoms such as dyspnoea, sore throat, cough and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localised), gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain, and may lead to misdiagnosis of hypersensitivity as respiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis), or gastroenteritis.
To avoid a delay in diagnosis and minimise the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, Ziagen must be permanently discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (respiratory diseases, flu-like illness, gastroenteritis or reactions to other medications).
Hypersensitivity reactions with rapid onset, including life-threatening reactions have occurred after restarting Ziagen in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity (skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and malaise) prior to stopping Ziagen.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).

In a meta-analysis of five clinical trials where abacavir was added to intensify therapy, of 166 subjects, 123 (74%) had M184V/ I, 50 (30%) had T215Y/ F, 45 (27%) had M41L, 30 (18%) had K70R and 25 (15%) had D67N.
Logistic regression modelling of the predictive value for genotype (adjusted for baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA [vRNA], CD4+ cell count, number and duration of prior antiretroviral therapies), showed that the presence of 3 or more NRTI resistance-associated mutations was associated with reduced response at Week 4 (p=0.015) or 4 or more mutations at median Week 24 (p≤ 0.012).
Although a similar antiviral effect was observed between the abacavir and indinavir containing regimens in terms of proportion of patients with undetectable viral load (≤ 400 copies/ ml; intention to treat analysis (ITT), 47% versus 49%; as treated analysis (AT), 86% versus 94% for abacavir and indinavir combinations respectively), results favoured the indinavir combination, particularly in the subset of patients with high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ ml at baseline; ITT, 46% versus 55%; AT, 84% versus 93% for abacavir and indinavir respectively).
In a multicentre, double-blind, controlled study (CNA30024), 654 HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve patients were randomised to receive either abacavir 300 mg twice daily or zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily.
ACTG5095 was a randomised (1:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in 1147 antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected adults, comparing 3 regimens: zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC), efavirenz (EFV) vs ZDV/ 3TC/ EFV vs ZDV/ 3TC/ ABC.
After a median follow-up of 32 weeks, the tritherapy with the three nucleosides ZDV/ 3TC/ ABC was shown to be virologically inferior to the two other arms regardless of baseline viral load (< or > 100 000 copies/ml) with 26% of subjects on the ZDV/3TC/ABC arm, 16% on the ZDV/3TC/EFV arm and 13% on the 4 drug arm categorised as having virological failure (HIV RNA > 200 copies/ml).
In a study comparing the unblinded NRTI combinations (with or without blinded nelfinavir) in children, a greater proportion treated with abacavir and lamivudine (71%) or abacavir and zidovudine (60%) had HIV-1 RNA ≤ 400 copies/ ml at 48 weeks, compared with those treated with lamivudine and zidovudine (47%)[ p=0.09, intention to treat analysis].
In study CAL30001, 182 treatment-experienced patients with virologic failure were randomised and received treatment with either the fixed-dose combination of abacavir/ lamivudine (FDC) once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily, both in combination with tenofovir and a PI or an NNRTI for 48 weeks.
Results indicate that the FDC group was non-inferior to the abacavir twice daily group, based on similar reductions in HIV-1 RNA as measured by average area under the curve minus baseline (AAUCMB, -1.65 log10 copies/ ml versus -1.83 log10 copies/ ml respectively, 95% CI -0.13, 0.38).
In study ESS30008, 260 patients with virologic suppression on a first line therapy regimen containing abacavir 300 mg plus lamivudine 150 mg, both given twice daily and a PI or NNRTI, were randomised to continue this regimen or switch to abacavir/ lamivudine FDC plus a PI or NNRTI for 48 weeks.
In a study of 20 HIV-infected patients receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily, with only one 300 mg dose taken prior to the 24 hour sampling period, the geometric mean terminal carbovir-TP intracellular half-life at steady-state was 20.6 hours, compared to the geometric mean abacavir plasma half-life in this study of 2.6 hours.
In populations similar to that enrolled in the PREDICT-1 study, it is estimated that 48% to 61% of patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele will develop a hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 0% to 4% of patients who do not have the HLA-B*5701 allele.
Other signs and symptoms may include respiratory signs and symptoms such as dyspnoea, sore throat, cough and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localised), gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain, and may lead to misdiagnosis of hypersensitivity as respiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis), or gastroenteritis.
To avoid a delay in diagnosis and minimise the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, Ziagen must be permanently discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (respiratory diseases, flu-like illness, gastroenteritis or reactions to other medications).
Hypersensitivity reactions with rapid onset, including life-threatening reactions have occurred after restarting Ziagen in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity (skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and malaise) prior to stopping Ziagen.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).

In a meta-analysis of five clinical trials where abacavir was added to intensify therapy, of 166 subjects, 123 (74%) had M184V/ I, 28 50 (30%) had T215Y/ F, 45 (27%) had M41L, 30 (18%) had K70R and 25 (15%) had D67N.
Logistic regression modelling of the predictive value for genotype (adjusted for baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA [vRNA], CD4+ cell count, number and duration of prior antiretroviral therapies), showed that the presence of 3 or more NRTI resistance-associated mutations was associated with reduced response at Week 4 (p=0.015) or 4 or more mutations at median Week 24 (p≤ 0.012).
Although a similar antiviral effect was observed between the abacavir and indinavir containing regimens in terms of proportion of patients with undetectable viral load (≤ 400 copies/ ml; intention to treat analysis (ITT), 47% versus 49%; as treated analysis (AT), 86% versus 94% for abacavir and indinavir combinations respectively), results favoured the indinavir combination, particularly in the subset of patients with high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ ml at baseline; ITT, 46% versus 55%; AT, 84% versus 93% for abacavir and indinavir respectively).
In a multicentre, double-blind, controlled study (CNA30024), 654 HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve patients were randomised to receive either abacavir 300 mg twice daily or zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily.
ACTG5095 was a randomised (1:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in 1147 antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected adults, comparing 3 regimens: zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC), efavirenz (EFV) vs ZDV/ 3TC/ EFV vs ZDV/ 3TC/ ABC.
After a median follow-up of 32 weeks, the tritherapy with the three nucleosides ZDV/ 3TC/ ABC was shown to be virologically inferior to the two other arms regardless of baseline viral load (< or > 100 000 copies/ml) with 26% of subjects on the ZDV/3TC/ABC arm, 16% on the ZDV/3TC/EFV arm and 13% on the 4 drug arm categorised as having virological failure (HIV RNA > 200 copies/ml).
In a study comparing the unblinded NRTI combinations (with or without blinded nelfinavir) in children, a greater proportion treated with abacavir and lamivudine (71%) or abacavir and zidovudine (60%) had HIV-1 RNA ≤ 400 copies/ ml at 48 weeks, compared with those treated with lamivudine and zidovudine (47%)[ p=0.09, intention to treat analysis].
In study CAL30001, 182 treatment-experienced patients with virologic failure were randomised and received treatment with either the fixed-dose combination of abacavir/ lamivudine (FDC) once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily, both in combination with tenofovir and a PI or an NNRTI for 48 weeks.
Results indicate that the FDC group was non-inferior to the abacavir twice daily group, based on similar reductions in HIV-1 RNA as measured by average area under the curve minus baseline (AAUCMB, -1.65 log10 copies/ ml versus -1.83 log10 copies/ ml respectively, 95% CI -0.13, 0.38).
In study ESS30008, 260 patients with virologic suppression on a first line therapy regimen containing abacavir 300 mg plus lamivudine 150 mg, both given twice daily and a PI or NNRTI, were randomised to continue this regimen or switch to abacavir/ lamivudine FDC plus a PI or NNRTI for 48 weeks.
In a study of 20 HIV-infected patients receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily, with only one 300 mg dose taken prior to the 24 hour sampling period, the geometric mean terminal carbovir-TP intracellular half-life at steady-state was 20.6 hours, compared to the geometric mean abacavir plasma half-life in this study of 2.6 hours.

Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination results in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.5).
Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e. g. ritonavir, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin) should be approached cautiously, as the combination results in increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.5).
Although the concomitant administration of methylprednisolone with the single 40 mg dose of aprepitant has not been studied, a single 40 mg dose of aprepitant produces a weak inhibition of CYP3A4 and it is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of methylprednisolone to a clinically significant degree.
Effect of other active substances on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant CYP3A4 inhibitors Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e. g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin) should be approached cautiously, as the combination results in increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant.
CYP3A4 inducers Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination results in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in decreased efficacy.
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) and very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Additional adverse reactions were observed in patients treated with the aprepitant (125 mg/ 80 mg) regimen for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and at a greater incidence than with standard therapy: abdominal pain, acid reflux, acne, alkaline phosphatase increased, anaemia, anorexia, anxiety, AST increased, asthaenia/ fatigue, candidiasis, chest discomfort, cognitive disorder, conjunctivitis, constipation, cough, diarrhoea, disorientation, dizziness, dream abnormality, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, dysuria, enterocolitis, epigastric discomfort, eructation, euphoria, febrile neutropenia, flatulence, flushing, gastroesophageal reflux disease, headache, hiccups, hot flush, hyperglycaemia, hyperhidrosis, hyponatraemia, lethargy, microscopic haematuria, muscle cramp, myalgia, nausea*, obstipation, oedema, oily skin, perforating duodenal ulcer, pharyngitis, photosensitivity, pollakiuria,
5 polydipsia, polyuria, postnasal drip, pruritus, rash, skin lesion, sneezing, staphylococcal infection, stomatitis, thirst, throat irritation, tinnitus, vomiting*, weight decreased, weight gain. *Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5 days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were reported as reactions only thereafter.
Fosaprepitant 115 mg, a lyophilized prodrug of aprepitant, may be substituted for oral EMEND (125 mg), 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy, on Day 1 only of the chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) regimen as an intravenous infusion administered over 15 minutes.
Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination results in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.5).

EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg with dexamethasone co-administered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and EMEND when given as 80 mg/ day with dexamethasone co- administered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate, 2.2-fold on Days 1 and 5.
EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/ day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of methylprednisolone, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.3-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when methylprednisolone was co-administered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on Days 2 and 3.
In pharmacokinetic studies, EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/ day on Days 2 and 3, did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered intravenously on Day 1 or vinorelbine administered intravenously on Day 1 or Day 8.
Because the effect of EMEND on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered CYP3A4 substrates is greater than the effect of EMEND on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered CYP3A4 substrates, an interaction with orally administered chemotherapeutic agents metabolised primarily or in part by CYP3A4 (e. g. etoposide, vinorelbine) cannot be excluded.
EMEND increased the AUC of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, 2.3-fold on Day 1 and 3.3- fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam was co-administered on Days 1 and 5 of a regimen of EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/ day on Days 2 to 5.
In another study with intravenous administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/ day on Days 2 and 3, and 2 mg midazolam was given intravenously prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15.
When a single 125 mg dose of EMEND was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/ day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilised on chronic warfarin therapy, there was no effect of EMEND on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3; however, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in INR 5 days after completion of dosing with EMEND.
EMEND, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/ day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15.
Aprepitant, when given once daily for 14 days as a 100 mg capsule with an oral contraceptive containing 35 μ g of ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg of norethindrone, decreased the AUC of ethinyl estradiol by 43%, and decreased the AUC of norethindrone by 8%.
In another study, single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were administered on Days 1 through 21 with EMEND, given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 8 and 80 mg/ day on Days 9 and 10 with ondansetron 32 mg intravenouslyon Day 8 and oral dexamethasone given as 12 mg on Day 8 and 8 mg/ day on Days 9, 10, and 11.

The most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy were: hiccups (4.6% versus 2.9%), asthenia/ fatigue (2.9% versus 1.6%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2.8% versus 1.5%), constipation (2.2% versus 2.0%), headache (2.2% versus 1.8%), and anorexia (2.0% versus 0.5%).
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) and very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Additional adverse reactions were observed in patients treated with aprepitant (40 mg) for postoperative nausea and vomiting and a greater incidence than with ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, bowel sounds abnormal, dysarthria, dyspnoea, hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, sensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, visual acuity reduced, wheezing.
In 2 randomised, double-blind studies encompassing a total of 1,094 patients receiving chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≥ 70 mg/ m2, aprepitant in combination with an ondansetron/ dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with a standard regimen (placebo plus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4).
* The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and concomitant chemotherapy, which were included in the primary analysis of odds ratios and logistic models. † One patient in the Aprepitant Regimen only had data in the acute phase and was excluded from the overall and delayed phase analyses; one patient in the Standard Regimen only had data in the delayed phase and was excluded from the overall and acute phase analyses.
19 In a randomised, double-blind study in a total of 866 patients (864 females, 2 males) receiving chemotherapy that included cyclophosphamide 750-1500 mg/ m2; or cyclophosphamide 500- 1500 mg/ m2 and doxorubicin (< 60 mg/ m2) or epirubicin (< 100 mg/ m2), aprepitant in combination with an ondansetron/ dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with standard therapy (placebo plus ondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1).
* The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for age category (< 55 years, ≥ 55 years) and investigator group, which were included in the primary analysis of odds ratios and logistic models. † One patient in the Aprepitant Regimen only had data in the acute phase and was excluded from the overall and delayed phase analyses.
Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3, the AUC0-24hr (mean±SD) was 19.6±2.5 microgram x h/ ml and 21.2±6.3 microgram x h/ ml on Days 1 and 3, respectively.

Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) and very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Additional adverse reactions were observed in patients treated with aprepitant (40 mg) for postoperative nausea and vomiting and a greater incidence than with ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, bowel sounds abnormal, dysarthria, dyspnoea, hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, sensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, visual acuity reduced, wheezing.
In 2 randomised, double-blind studies encompassing a total of 1,094 patients receiving chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≥ 70 mg/ m2, aprepitant in combination with an ondansetron/ dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with a standard regimen (placebo plus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4).
* The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and concomitant chemotherapy, which were included in the primary analysis of odds ratios and logistic models. † One patient in the Aprepitant Regimen only had data in the acute phase and was excluded from the overall and delayed phase analyses; one patient in the Standard Regimen only had data in the delayed phase and was excluded from the overall and acute phase analyses.
In a randomised, double-blind study in a total of 866 patients (864 females, 2 males) receiving chemotherapy that included cyclophosphamide 750-1500 mg/ m2; or cyclophosphamide 500- 1500 mg/ m2 and doxorubicin (< 60 mg/ m2) or epirubicin (< 100 mg/ m2), aprepitant in combination with an ondansetron/ dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with standard therapy (placebo plus ondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1).
* The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for age category (< 55 years, ≥ 55 years) and investigator group, which were included in the primary analysis of odds ratios and logistic models. † One patient in the Aprepitant Regimen only had data in the acute phase and was excluded from the overall and delayed phase analyses.
Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3, the AUC0-24hr (mean±SD) was 19.6±2.5 microgram x h/ ml and 21.2±6.3 microgram x h/ ml on Days 1 and 3, respectively.

The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that AZILECT’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson’ s disease as monotherapy (without levodopa) or as adjunct therapy (with levodopa) in patients with end of dose fluctuations.
In vitro studies showed that rasagiline at a concentration of 1 µg/ ml (equivalent to a level that is 160 times the average Cmax ~ 5.9-8.5 ng/ ml in Parkinson’ s disease patients after 1 mg rasagiline multiple dosing), did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP4A.
Results of four tyramine challenge studies (in volunteers and PD patients), together with results of home monitoring of blood pressure after meals (of 464 patients treated with 0.5 or 1 mg/ day of rasagiline or placebo as adjunct therapy to levodopa for six months without tyramine restrictions), and the fact that there were no reports of tyramine/ rasagiline interaction in clinical studies conducted without tyramine restriction, indicate that rasagiline can be used safely without dietary tyramine restrictions.
The difference between the mean change from baseline to week 26/ termination (LOCF, Last Observation Carried Forward) was statistically significant (UPDRS, parts I-III: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -4.2, 95% CI [-5.7, -2.7]; p < 0.0001; for rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -3.6, 95% CI [-5.0, -2.1]; p < 0.0001, UPDRS Motor, part II: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -2.7, 95% CI [-3.87, -1.55], p < 0.0001; for rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -1.68, 95% CI [-2.85, -0.51], p=0.0050).
In study II patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (229 patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/ day (231 patients) or the catechol-O– methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, entacapone, 200 mg taken along with scheduled doses of levodopa (LD)/ decarboxylase inhibitor (227 patients), and were treated for 18 weeks.
Certain antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants), the antibiotic ciprofloxacin used against infections, the cough suppressant dextromethorphan, sympathomimetics such as those present in nasal and oral decongestants and cold medications containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine.
Abdominal pain, accidental injury (primary falls), allergic reaction, fever, flu syndrome, malaise, neck pain, angina pectoris, low blood pressure when rising to a standing position (postural hypotension), anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, dry mouth, vomiting, abnormal results of blood tests (leucopenia), joint pain (arthralgia), arthritis, tenosynovitis, weight loss, abnormal dreams, difficulty in muscular co- ordination (ataxia), depression, vertigo, prolonged muscle contractions (dystonia), rhinitis, contact dermatitis, rash, vesiculobullous rash, conjunctivitis, urinary urgency
Zavesca is used in patients who cannot receive the standard treatment of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) given by infusion (drip into a vein);  adults, adolescents and children with Niemann-Pick type C disease, a potentially fatal disease in which glycosphingolipids build up within cells in the brain and elsewhere in the body.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Zavesca’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the oral treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom ERT is unsuitable, and of progressive neurological manifestations in adult and paediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease.
The company that makes Zavesca will complete the following studies to address the product’ s effectiveness and safety in type 1 Gaucher disease:  a post-marketing plan to inform doctors on how to use Zavesca and to get patients to report information on the safety of the medicine;  a study to follow up patients already in clinical trials, to continue assessment of the medicine’ s safety and effectiveness and to find out more about the neurological aspects of the disease;  a study to look at the effectiveness and safety of Zavesca in patients who switch from ERT;  a further study of the natural history of the disease, together with the European Working Group for Gaucher Disease (EWGGD).
In patients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 50– 70 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2, administration should commence at a dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a dose of 200 mg twice daily (adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease.
In patients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 30– 50 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2, administration should commence at a dose of 100 mg once daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease.
The benefit of treatment with Zavesca for neurological manifestations in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease should be evaluated on a regular basis, e. g. every 6 months; continuation of therapy should be re-appraised after at least 1 year of treatment with Zavesca, (see section 4.4).
Dosing in children at 200 mg t. i. d. adjusted for body surface area resulted in Cmax and AUCτ values which were approximately two-fold those attained after 100 mg t. i. d. in type 1 Gaucher disease patients, consistent with the dose-linear pharmacokinetics of miglustat.
Further effects seen in animals at doses that result in exposure levels similar to or moderately higher than the clinical exposure level were: changes in lymphoid organs in all species tested, transaminase changes, vacuolation of thyroid and pancreas, cataracts, nephropathy and myocardial changes in rats.
Administration of miglustat to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats by oral gavage for 2 years at dose levels of 30, 60 and 180 mg/ kg/ day resulted in an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell (Leydig cell) hyperplasia and adenomas in male rats at all dose levels.
8 Administration of miglustat to male and female CD1 mice by oral gavage at dose levels of 210, 420 and 840/ 500 mg/ kg/ day (dose reduction after half a year) for 2 years resulted in an increased incidence of inflammatory and hyperplastic lesions in the large intestine in both sexes.

The most common side effects seen with Targretin (in more than 1 patient in 10) are leucopenia (reduced white cell count), hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland), hyperlipaemia (high levels of fats in the blood), hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol), exfoliative dermatitis (skin peeling), pruritus (itching), rash, pain, headache and asthenia (weakness).
Targretin should also not be used in the following situations:  women who are pregnant or breast-feeding  women who could become pregnant  anyone who has had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)  uncontrolled hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol).  uncontrolled hypertriglyceridaemia (high blood triglycerides [fat]).  hypervitaminosis A (high levels of vitamin A)  uncontrolled thyroid disease.  liver disease  where there is a body infection.
If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institution of antilipaemic therapy is recommended, and if necessary, dose reductions (from 300 mg/ m2/ day of bexarotene to 200 mg/ m2/ day, and if necessary to 100 mg/ m2/ day) or treatment discontinuation.
Patients with CTCL having risk factors for pancreatitis (e. g., prior episodes of pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) should not be treated with bexarotene, unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
Caution is advised in case of combination with CYP3A4 substrates having a narrow therapeutic margin i. e. immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) as well as CYP3A4- metabolised cytotoxics, i. e. cyclophosphamide, etoposide, finasteride, ifosfamide, tamoxifen, vinca- alcaloids.
Therefore, repeated administration of bexarotene may result in an auto-induction of its own metabolism and, particularly at dose levels greater than 300 mg/ m2/ day, may increase the rate of metabolism and reduce plasma concentrations of other substances metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4, such as tamoxifen.
In 109 patients with CTCL treated at the recommended initial dose of 300 mg/ m2/ day, the most commonly reported adverse reactions to Targretin were hyperlipaemia ((primarily elevated triglycerides) 74%), hypothyroidism (29%), hypercholesterolaemia (28%), headache (27%), leucopenia (20%), pruritus (20%), asthenia (19%), rash (16%), exfoliative dermatitis (15%), and pain (12%).

Taking other medicines Before starting treatment, make sure your doctor knows if you are taking medicines (including those not prescribed by your doctor), such as ketoconazole and itraconazole (used against fungal infections), erythromycin, clarithromycin and rifampicin (used against bacterial infections), phenytoin and phenobarbital (used against seizures), gemfibrozil (used to reduce high levels of fats in the blood such as triglycerides and cholesterol), vitamin A supplements, protease inhibitors (used against viral infections), tamoxifen (used against some forms of cancer) or dexamethasone (used for inflammatory conditions).
The capsule shell consists of gelatin, sorbitol special-glycerine blend (glycerin, sorbitol, sorbitol anhydrides (1,4-sorbitan), mannitol and water), titanium dioxide (E171) and printing ink (SDA 35A alcohol (ethanol & ethyl acetate), propylene glycol (E1520), iron oxide black (E172), polyvinyl acetate phthalate, purified water, isopropyl alcohol, macrogol 400, ammonium hydroxide 28%)
Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents Compared with placebo, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms (comprising rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, sneezing and nasal itching) and ocular symptoms (comprising itching/ burning, tearing/ watering and redness of the eyes) in all 4 studies.
A study of a single 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in increased Cmax (42%) and AUC(0-∞) (172%) and a modest (on average 23%) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects.
The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version GM2006/ 00247/ 02 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

In a phase III study in combination with cyclophosphamide (CPA) comparing Myocet (60 mg/ m2) + CPA (600 mg/ m2) versus doxorubicin (60 mg/ m2) + CPA (600 mg/ m2), 6% versus 21% of patients, respectively, developed a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
Myocet (60 mg/ m2) + CPA (600 mg/ m2) was compared with conventional doxorubicin + CPA (at the same doses) and Myocet (75 mg/ m2) + CPA (600 mg/ m2) was compared to epirubicin + CPA (at the same doses).
In general however, the plasma levels of total doxorubicin are substantially higher with Myocet than with conventional doxorubicin, while the data indicate that peak plasma levels of free (not liposome-encapsulated) doxorubicin are lower with Myocet than with conventional doxorubicin.
The clearance of total doxorubicin was 5.1 ± 4.8 l/ h and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vd) was 56.6 ± 61.5 l whereas after conventional doxorubicin, clearance and Vd were 46.7 ± 9.6 l/ h and 1,451 ± 258 l, respectively.
Reconstitute doxorubicin HCl • Withdraw 20 ml sodium chloride for injection (0.9%), preservative free, (not provided in the package), and inject into each Myocet doxorubicin HCl, intended for preparation. • Shake well in the inverted position to ensure doxorubicin is fully dissolved.
After reconstitution the finished product must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/ v) sodium chloride for injection, or 5% (w/ v) glucose for injection to a final volume of 40 ml to 120 ml per 50 mg reconstituted Myocet so that a final concentration of 0.4 to 1.2 mg/ ml doxorubicin is obtained.
You should tell your doctor if: • you are allergic to doxorubicin or any of the ingredients contained in Myocet. • you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant, or are breast-feeding. • you have a history of cardiovascular disease (for example heart attacks, heart failure or long- standing high blood pressure) • you have problems with your liver.
Other less common side effects may include: • shortness of breath and swollen ankles because of heart failure, irregular heart beat, low potassium level in the blood (which may be noticed as weakness and cramps), • breathing difficulties, cough, chest pains and fainting, coughing blood, • swelling and reddening and blistering of the skin around the injection site, • stomach pains from an open sore on the lining of the stomach, also called gastric ulcer and pain and swelling of the food pipe, • fever and chills (covers pneumonitis, plus breathing difficulties and cough), muscle weakness and aches, • yellowing of the skin and/ or eyes, also called jaundice, • change in frequency of urination, painful urination and blood in the urine, • constipation, feeling thirsty and loss of appetite, • skin problems including itchiness of the skin, tender, swollen areas around hair roots and nail disorders, • abnormal manner of walking, • speech difficulties, • back pain, • nose bleeds, • agitation, • sleepiness or drowsiness but sometimes insomnia.
Reconstitute doxorubicin HCl • Withdraw 20 ml sodium chloride for injection (0.9%), preservative free, (not provided in the package), and inject into each Myocet doxorubicin HCl, intended for preparation. • Shake well in the inverted position to ensure doxorubicin is fully dissolved.
Heat in water bath or dry heat block • Heat the reconstituted Myocet doxorubicin HCl vial in the Techne DB-3 Dri Block heater with the thermometer in the block reading (75-76°C) for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). • If using the water bath heat the Myocet doxorubicin HCl vial with the thermometer temperature reading 55-60°C for 10 minutes (not to exceed 15 minutes). • While heating proceed to step 4
After reconstitution the finished product must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for injection, or 5% (w/v) glucose for injection to a final volume of 40 ml to 120 ml per 50 mg reconstituted Myocet so that a final concentration of 0.4 to 1.2 mg/ml doxorubicin is obtained.
The most common side effects with Myocet (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are infection, neutropenic fever (fever associated with low white blood cell counts), neutropenia (low white blood cell counts), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting, stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth) or mucositis (inflammation of the mouth and throat), diarrhoea, alopecia (hair loss), skin effects such as rash and dry skin, and fatigue, malaise (feeling unwell) or asthenia (weakness).
The daily dose should be preferably optimised using one of the four available tablet strengths (50 mg/ 12.5 mg/ 200 mg, 100 mg/ 25 mg/ 200 mg, 150 mg/ 37.5 mg/ 200 mg or 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 200 mg levodopa/ carbidopa/ entacapone).
While the experience with total daily dosage greater than 200 mg carbidopa is limited, the maximum recommended daily dose of entacapone is 2000 mg and therefore the maximum dose is 10 tablets per day for the Stalevo strengths of 50 mg/ 12.5 mg/ 200 mg, 100 mg/ 25 mg/ 200 mg and 150 mg/ 37.5 mg/ 200 mg.
2 For example, a patient taking one tablet of 50 mg/ 12.5 mg of levodopa/ carbidopa with one tablet of entacapone 200 mg four times daily can take one 50 mg/ 12.5 mg/ 200 mg Stalevo tablet four times daily in place of their usual levodopa/ carbidopa and entacapone doses.
When initiating Stalevo therapy for patients currently treated with entacapone and levodopa/ carbidopa in doses not equal to Stalevo 50 mg/ 12.5 mg/ 200 mg, (or 100 mg/ 25 mg/ 200 mg, or 150 mg/ 37.5 mg/ 200 mg or 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 200 mg) tablets, Stalevo dosing should be carefully titrated for optimal clinical response.
If Stalevo treatment (levodopa/ carbidopa/ entacapone) is discontinued and the patient is transferred to levodopa/ DDC inhibitor therapy without entacapone, it is necessary to adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian treatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian symptoms.
NMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e. g., agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase.
A significant number of Parkinson's disease patients have been treated with the combination of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone with several active substances including MAO-A inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline and venlafaxine and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e. g. catechol-structured compounds, paroxetine).
Patients being treated with Stalevo and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see section 4.4).
Gastrointestinal bleeding, development of duodenal ulcer, hypertension, phlebitis, leucopenia, haemolytic and non-haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, chest pain, dyspnoea and paraesthesia have occurred rarely with levodopa/ carbidopa.
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (1≥ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical trials or epidemiological studies).

It is available as a range of brown oval tablets containing levodopa and carbidopa in four doses (50 mg levodopa and 12.5 mg carbidopa, 100 mg levodopa and 25 mg carbidopa, 150 mg levodopa and 37.5 mg carbidopa, or 200 mg levodopa and 50 mg carbidopa).
Stalevo is used in patients who are being treated with a combination of levodopa and an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase (two standard treatments for Parkinson’ s disease) but are having ‘ fluctuations’ towards the end of the period between two doses of their medication that cannot be treated with the standard combination alone.
The most common side effects with Stalevo are dyskinesia (uncontrollable movements), nausea (feeling sick), harmless urine discoloration and mental changes including symptoms of paranoia and psychosis (altered sense of reality), depression (possibly with thoughts of suicide) and problems with memory or thinking.
Stalevo should not be used in patients with: • severe liver disease; • narrow-angle glaucoma (increased pressure within the eye); • phaeochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland); • a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a dangerous nervous disorder usually caused by antipsychotic medicines) or rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle fibres).

The Company that makes Tygacil will monitor the development of resistance (when a germ that was sensitive to the action of an antibiotic develops ways of fighting its effects), they will also look at the mechanism of interaction of Tygacil with warfarin (a medicine used to thin blood), and the use of Tygacil in patients who have problems eliminating bile (cholestasis)
3 In clinical trials in complicated intra-abdominal infections, the most common type of infection in tigecycline treated-patients was complicated appendicitis (51%), followed by other diagnoses less commonly reported such as complicated cholecystitis (14%), intra-abdominal abscess (10%), perforation of intestine (10%) and gastric or duodenal ulcer perforation less than 24 hours (5%).
As it is known for tetracycline class antibiotics, tigecycline may also induce permanent dental defects (discolouration and enamel defects) and a delay in ossification processes in foetuses, exposed in utero during the last half of gestation, and in children under eight years of age due to the enrichment in tissues with a high calcium turnover and formation of calcium chelate complexes (see section 4.4).

Do not take any diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor. • Tell your doctor if you have or previously had any side effects due to antibiotics belonging to the tetracycline class (e. g., skin sensitization to sun light, staining on developing teeth, pancreas inflammation, and alteration of certain laboratory values aimed at measuring how well your blood clots).
22 • In certain serious infections, your doctor may consider to use Tygacil in combination with other antibiotics. • Tell your doctor if you are taking certain medicines (named anticoagulants) aimed at avoiding an excess of blood clotting (see also Using other medicines in this leaflet). • Tell your doctor if you are taking the contraceptive pill as you may need an additional method of contraception while receiving Tygacil (see also Using other medicines in this leaflet). • Tell your doctor if you have, or previously had liver problems.
Common side effects reported in at least 1 in 100 patients but in less than 1 in 10 patients receiving Tygacil are: • Abscess (collection of pus), infections • Laboratory measurements of decreased ability to form blood clots • Dizziness • Vein irritations from the injection, including pain, inflammation, swelling and clotting • Abdominal pain, dyspepsia (stomach ache and indigestion), anorexia (loss of appetite) • Increases in liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia (excess of bile pigment in the blood) • Pruritus (itching), rash • Headache • Increase in amylase, which is an enzyme found in the salivary glands and pancreas, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
Uncommon side effects reported in at least 1 in 1,000 patients but less than 1 in 100 patients receiving Tygacil are: • Sepsis (severe infection in the body and blood stream)/ septic shock (serious medical condition which can lead to multiple organ failure and death as a result of sepsis) • Low protein levels in the blood • Acute pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas which may result in severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting) • Jaundice • Injection site reaction (pain, redness, inflammation). • Inflammation of the liver
Other side effects reported (frequency not known) in patients receiving Tygacil are: • Anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions (that may range from mild to severe, including a sudden, generalised allergic reaction that may lead to a life-threatening shock [e. g. difficulty in breathing, drop of blood pressure, fast pulse]). • Low platelet levels in the blood (which may lead to an increased bleeding tendency and bruising/ haematoma)

The following adverse effects were reported very rarely: allergic reaction, chills, fatigue, hypotonic- hyporesponsive episode, malaise, oedema, pallor, swelling or oedema of the entire limb(s), transient local lymph node swelling, convulsions (febrile and non febrile), encephalitis, encephalopathy with acute brain oedema, eyes rolling, Guillain Barré Syndrome, hypotonia, neuritis, abdominal pain, meteorism, nausea, petechiae, purpura, purpura thrombocytopenic, thrombocytopenia, agitation, sleep disorder, dyspnoea or Stridor inspiratory, angioedema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria and flushing.
INTRODUCTION The EMEA published its initial review on the benefit/ risk profile of hexavalent vaccines (EMEA/ 8519/ 03, EMEA/ CHMP/ 5889/ 03) in April and December 2003, concluding that there was no change to the benefit/ risk profile and therefore no changes to the conditions of use were recommended, for, among others, the following reasons:
The CHMP, upon review of the safety of Hexavac, acknowledged the finding of a statistical signal of an excess occurrence of SUD after Hexavac booster vaccination in the 2nd year of life, but also the inability to identify a biological mechanism in spite of meticulous expert considerations, and the initiation of epidemiological studies.
Nevertheless, in accordance with the current knowledge, the CHMP considers that childhood Hepatitis B vaccines should be as immunogenic as possible necessitating a maximum of a single booster dose during adolescence to ensure protective efficacy at the time vaccinated subjects might be exposed to a higher risk of infection compared to infancy and childhood.
• The CHMP considered that the benefit/ risk balance of Hexavac for primary and booster vaccination of children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hepatitis B caused by all known subtypes of viruses, poliomyelitis and invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, was not favourable.
Undesirable effects reported in clinical trials and the marketed use to date of Sanofi Pasteur MSD diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b and inactivated poliomyelitis adsorbed vaccine are included in the list of undesirable effects for HEXAVAC.
Immune response after booster injection In the pivotal clinical study where toddlers received HEXAVAC as a booster dose after having been primed with HEXAVAC, antibody titres equal to or greater than 0.1 IU/ ml were achieved by all toddlers to tetanus and by 98.8% to diphtheria.

HEXAVAC is indicated to help protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, infection of the liver caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus and invasive disease (infection of brain and spinal cord tissues, infection of the blood, etc.) caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacterium in children 8 weeks to 18 months of age.
Very rarely there may be allergic reaction; chills; fatigue; malaise; oedema; swelling of the entire limb(s); Guillain Barré Syndrome; hypotonic hyporesponsive episode; pallor; convulsions (with or without fever); brain inflammation, acute brain swelling; eyes rolling; decrease in muscle tone; neuritis; nausea; abdominal gas and/ or pain; low platelet count; purple or red brown spots visible through the skin; agitation; difficulty sleeping; breathing difficulty; wheezing; swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing; rash; skin redness; generalized hives; generalized itching; flushing; temporary swelling of local lymph nodes.
After administration of sugammadex at reappearance of T2 following a rocuronium induced blockade, the median time to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 in adults (18-64 years) was 2.2 minutes, in elderly adults (65-74 years) it was 2.6 minutes and in very elderly adults (75 years or more) it was 3.6 minutes.
5 Two thorough QTc trials (N=146), both in conscious volunteers, demonstrated that sugammadex alone or in combination with rocuronium or vecuronium is not associated with QTc interval prolongation. The one-sided 95% upper confidence limits for the QTc difference to placebo were well below the 10 ms margin for each of the 12-13 evaluated timepoints in both studies.
Sugammadex has been administered in doses ranging from 0.5 mg/ kg to 16 mg/ kg in dose response studies of rocuronium induced blockade (0.6, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.2 mg/ kg rocuronium bromide with and without maintenance doses) and vecuronium induced blockade (0.1 mg/ kg vecuronium bromide with or without maintenance doses) at different time points/ depths of blockade.
If Bridion is administered via the same infusion line that is also used for other medicinal products, it is important that the infusion line is adequately flushed (e. g. with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9% solution)) between administration of Bridion and medicinal products for which incompatibility with Bridion has been demonstrated or for which compatibility with Bridion has not been established.
Sugammadex can be injected into the intravenous line of a running infusion with the following intravenous solutions: sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%), glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%), sodium chloride 4.5 mg/ ml (0.45%) and glucose 25 mg/ ml (2.5%), Ringers lactate solution, Ringers solution, glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) in sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%).
Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 2.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
This is important as Bridion is removed from your body by the kidneys. • if you have heart disease or have had it in the past. • if you have liver disease or have had it in the past. • if you have fluid retention (oedema). • if you are on a controlled salt diet. → Tell your anaesthetist if any of the above applies to you.
The amount of progestogen lost by using Bridion is about the same as missing one oral contraceptive Pill. → If you are taking the Pill on the same day as Bridion is given to you, follow the instructions for a missed dose in the Pill’ s package leaflet. → If you are using other hormonal contraceptives (for example a vaginal ring, implant or IUS) you should use an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method (such as a condom) for the next 7 days and follow the advice in the package leaflet.
Uncommon side effects (in 1 to 10 users in 1,000) • Being awake during the operation (anaesthesia awareness) • Shortness of breath due to muscle cramps of the airways (bronchospasm) occurred in patients with a history of asthma • Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions - such as a rash or red skin.
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure.
3 As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see section 5.1).
Diuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Winthrop has been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics.
Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i. e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease: in addition to the adverse drug reactions mentioned under hypertension, in diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i. e., uncommon) but in excess of placebo.
Paediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%).
In patients not adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/ 3-6 mm Hg (systolic/ diastolic).
Reduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/ kg (low), 1.5 mg/ kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/ kg (high) target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of hypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period.
Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).
In 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria ≥ 900 mg/ day and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/ dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Winthrop on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined.
Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (e. g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of ≤ 135/ 85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg.
Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)].
As for the secondary endpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups in the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo- based regimen.
While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/ kg/ day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion.

While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/ kg/ day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion.
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure.
44 As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see section 5.1).
Diuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Irbesartan Winthrop has been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics.
Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i. e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (see section 5.3).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease: in addition to the adverse drug reactions mentioned under hypertension, in diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i. e., uncommon) but in excess of placebo.
Paediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%).
In patients not adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/ 3-6 mm Hg (systolic/ diastolic).
Reduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/ kg (low), 1.5 mg/ kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/ kg (high) target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of hypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period.
Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).
In 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria ≥ 900 mg/ day and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/ dl, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Irbesartan Winthrop on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined.
Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (e. g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of ≤ 135/ 85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg.
Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)].

Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).
Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening undesirable effects [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).
Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Renal insufficiency: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2).
Contraindications of concomitant use Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3).
Other interactions Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “ q8h” or “ q12h”).
AUC: ↔ */ ** (↓ 10% to ↑ 26%) Cmax: ↔ */ ** (↓ 5% to ↑ 26%) Cmin: ↑ 12%*/ ** (↓ 16% to ↑ 49%) (CYP3A4 induction). * When compared to atazanavir 300 mg/ ritonavir 100 mg once daily in the evening without efavirenz.
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction The geometric mean Cmin for indinavir (0.33 mg/ l) when given with ritonavir and efavirenz was higher than the mean historical Cmin (0.15 mg/ l) when indinavir was given alone at 800 mg q8h.
Morning AUC: ↑ 18% (↑ 6 to ↑ 33) Evening AUC: ↔ Morning Cmax: ↑ 24% (↑ 12 to ↑ 38) Evening Cmax: ↔ Morning Cmin: ↑ 42% (↑ 9 to ↑ 86)b Evening Cmin: ↑ 24% (↑ 3 to ↑ 50)b Efavirenz:

AUC: ↓ 60% (↓ 52 to ↓ 68) Cmax: ↓ 62% (↓ 55 to ↓ 78) (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values.
AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/ or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%).
The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks).
Analysis of long-term data from study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.
Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000) including isolated reports.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Liver enzymes: elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5-8% after long-term treatment in study 006).
Elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5 - 2% of patients treated with control regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term treatment).
In the long-term data set from study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/ or C (hepatitis C antibody positive).
Among these co-infected patients, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of those in the control arm, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of the patients in the control arm.
Postmarketing experience with efavirenz has shown the following additional adverse reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens: cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, delusion, hepatic failure, neurosis, photoallergic dermatitis, psychosis and completed suicide.
Antiviral activity: the free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/ monocyte cultures.
The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold resistance).
Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/ or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients.
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry.
In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who terminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/ ml at the missing time points.
Long-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with EFV +IDV, 196 patients with EFV + ZDV + 3TC and 127 patients with IDV + ZDV + 3TC, respectively), suggest durability of response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ ml, HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.

ACTG 382 is an ongoing uncontrolled study of 57 NRTI-experienced paediatric patients (3 - 16 years) which characterises the pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity and safety of efavirenz in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/ kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs.
Effect of food: the bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of efavirenz hard capsules in uninfected volunteers was increased 22% and 17%, respectively, when given with a meal of high fat or normal composition, relative to the bioavailability of a 600 mg dose given under fasted conditions (see section 4.4).
Paediatric pharmacokinetics: in 49 paediatric patients receiving the equivalent of a 600 mg dose of efavirenz (dose adjusted from calculated body size based on weight), steady state Cmax was 14.1 μ M, steady state Cmin was 5.6 μ M, and AUC was 216 μ M·h.
Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).
Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening undesirable effects [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).
Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Renal insufficiency: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2).
Contraindications of concomitant use Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3).
Other interactions Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “ q8h” or “ q12h”).

No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction The geometric mean Cmin for indinavir (0.33 mg/ l) when given with ritonavir and efavirenz was higher than the mean historical Cmin (0.15 mg/ l) when indinavir was given alone at 800 mg q8h.

AUC: ↑ 21% (↑ 10 to ↑ 34) Cmax: ↑ 14% (↑ 4 to ↑ 26) Cmin: ↑ 25% (↑ 7 to ↑ 46)b (inhibition of CYP-mediated oxidative metabolism) When efavirenz was given with ritonavir 500 mg or 600 mg twice daily, the combination was not well tolerated (for example, dizziness, nausea, paraesthesia and elevated liver enzymes occurred).
AUC: ↓ 60% (↓ 52 to ↓ 68) Cmax: ↓ 62% (↓ 55 to ↓ 78) (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values.
AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/ or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%).
The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks).
Analysis of long-term data from study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.
Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000) including isolated reports.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Liver enzymes: elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5 - 8% after long-term treatment in study 006).
Elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5 - 2% of patients treated with control regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term treatment).
In the long-term data set from study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/ or C (hepatitis C antibody positive).
Among these co-infected patients, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of those in the control arm, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of the patients in the control arm.
Postmarketing experience with efavirenz has shown the following additional adverse reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens: cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, delusion, hepatic failure, neurosis, photoallergic dermatitis, psychosis and completed suicide.
Antiviral activity: the free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/ monocyte cultures.
The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold resistance).

Postmarketing experience with efavirenz has shown the following additional adverse reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens: cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, delusion, hepatic failure, neurosis, photoallergic dermatitis, psychosis and completed suicide.
Antiviral activity: the free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/ monocyte cultures.
The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold resistance).
Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/ or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients.
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry.
In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who terminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/ ml at the missing time points.
Long-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with EFV +IDV, 196 patients with EFV + ZDV + 3TC and 127 patients with IDV + ZDV + 3TC, respectively), suggest durability of response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ ml, HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.

ACTG 382 is an ongoing uncontrolled study of 57 NRTI-experienced paediatric patients (3 - 16 years) which characterises the pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity and safety of efavirenz in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/ kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs.
In 17 paediatric patients receiving an investigational oral solution similar to the commercial formulation adjusted on the basis of body size to be equivalent to an adult 600 mg capsule dose, the steady-state Cmax was 11.8 μ M, steady state Cmin was 5.2 μ M, and AUC was 188 μ M·h.
Renal impairment: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.4).
Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) because competition for CYP3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening undesirable effects [for example, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression] (see section 4.5).
Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Renal insufficiency: the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal impairment on efavirenz elimination should be minimal (see section 4.2).
Contraindications of concomitant use Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine) since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3).
Other interactions Interactions between efavirenz and protease inhibitors, antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “ q8h” or “ q12h”).

AUC: ↓ 60% (↓ 52 to ↓ 68) Cmax: ↓ 62% (↓ 55 to ↓ 78) (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values.
AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
In a subset of 1,008 adult patients who received 600 mg efavirenz daily in combination with PIs and/ or NRTIs in controlled clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse reactions of at least moderate severity reported in at least 5% of patients were rash (11.6%), dizziness (8.5%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%) and fatigue (5.5%).
The long-term safety profile of efavirenz-containing regimens was evaluated in a controlled trial (006) in which patients received efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 412, median duration 180 weeks), efavirenz + indinavir (n = 415, median duration 102 weeks), or indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine (n = 401, median duration 76 weeks).
Analysis of long-term data from study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for patients treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the control arm.
Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000) including isolated reports.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Liver enzymes: elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5 - 8% after long-term treatment in study 006).
Elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5 - 2% of patients treated with control regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term treatment).

Liver enzymes: elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) were seen in 3% of 1,008 patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz (5 - 8% after long-term treatment in study 006).
Elevations of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to greater than five times ULN were observed in 4% of all patients treated with 600 mg of efavirenz and 1.5 - 2% of patients treated with control regimens (7% of efavirenz-treated patients and 3% of control-treated patients after long-term treatment).
In the long-term data set from study 006, 137 patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/ or C (hepatitis C antibody positive).
Among these co-infected patients, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of those in the control arm, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20% of patients in the efavirenz arms and 7% of the patients in the control arm.
Postmarketing experience with efavirenz has shown the following additional adverse reactions to occur in association with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral treatment regimens: cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, delusion, hepatic failure, neurosis, photoallergic dermatitis, psychosis and completed suicide.
Antiviral activity: the free concentration of efavirenz required for 90 to 95% inhibition of wild type or zidovudine-resistant laboratory and clinical isolates in vitro ranged from 0.46 to 6.8 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophage/ monocyte cultures.
The single substitutions which led to the highest resistance to efavirenz in cell culture correspond to a leucine-to-isoleucine change at position 100 (L100I, 17 to 22-fold resistance) and a lysine-to-asparagine at position 103 (K103N, 18 to 33-fold resistance).
Two controlled studies (006 and ACTG 364) of approximately one year duration with efavirenz in combination with NRTIs and/ or PIs, have demonstrated reduction of viral load below the limit of quantification of the assay and increased CD4 lymphocytes in antiretroviral therapy-naïve and NRTI-experienced HIV-infected patients.
Study 006, a randomized, open-label trial, compared efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine or efavirenz + indinavir with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine in 1,266 patients who were required to be efavirenz-, lamivudine-, NNRTI-, and PI-naive at study entry.
In the analysis of responder rates (the non-completer equals failure analysis [NC = F]), patients who terminated the study early for any reason, or who had a missing HIV-RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV-RNA above 50 or above 400 copies/ ml at the missing time points.
Long-term results at 168 weeks of study 006 (160 patients completed study on treatment with EFV +IDV, 196 patients with EFV + ZDV + 3TC and 127 patients with IDV + ZDV + 3TC, respectively), suggest durability of response in terms of proportions of patients with HIV-RNA < 400 copies/ ml, HIV-RNA < 50 copies/ ml and in terms of mean change from baseline CD4 cell count.

ACTG 382 is an ongoing uncontrolled study of 57 NRTI-experienced paediatric patients (3 - 16 years) which characterises the pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity and safety of efavirenz in combination with nelfinavir (20 - 30 mg/ kg given three times a day) and one or more NRTIs.
Paediatric pharmacokinetics: in 49 paediatric patients receiving the equivalent of a 600 mg dose of efavirenz (dose adjusted from calculated body size based on weight), steady state Cmax was 14.1 μ M, steady state Cmin was 5.6 μ M, and AUC was 216 μ M·h.

Stocrin has been studied in three main studies involving over 1,100 adults:  in the first study, Stocrin in combination with lamivudine and zidovudine or with indinavir (other antiviral medicines) was compared with the combination of indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine;  the second study compared Stocrin in combination with nelfinavir and two other antiviral medicines with the same combination without Stocrin;  the third study compared adding Stocrin or placebo (a dummy treatment) to a combination of antiviral medicines that included indinavir and two other antiviral medicines, in patients who had already been receiving treatment for HIV infection.
All of the studies showed that combinations including Stocrin were at least as effective as the comparator medicines:  the first study showed that 67% of the adults treated with Stocrin in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine had viral loads below 400 copies/ ml after 48 weeks, compared with 54% of the patients treated with Stocrin and indinavir, and 45% of the patients treated with indinavir, lamivudine and zidovudine;  in the second study, Stocrin in combination with nelfinavir was superior to the combination without Stocrin:
Stocrin is also associated with nervous system symptoms, such as dizziness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), somnolence (sleepiness), impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming, and with psychiatric disorders, including severe depression, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and aggressive behaviour, especially in patients with a history of mental illness.
It must not be used in patients with severe liver disease or who are taking any of the following medicines:  astemizole, terfenadine (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms - these medicines may be available without prescription);  dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine (used to treat migraine headache);  midazolam, triazolam (used to relieve anxiety or difficulty sleeping);  pimozide (used to treat mental illnesses);  cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems);  bepridil (used to treat angina);  St John ’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression).
The most common side effects with Epivir (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, headache, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), cough, nasal symptoms, rash, muscle disorders, arthralgia (joint pain), alopecia (hair loss), fever, abdominal (tummy) pain or cramps, malaise (feeling unwell) and fatigue (tiredness).
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage when lamivudine was combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and abacavir as well as with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine as a once daily regimen.

When Ambirix was administered concomitantly with, but as a separate injection to a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV/ Hib) or with a combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in the second year of life, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory (see section 5.1)
During post-marketing surveillance with the three dose combined vaccine containing either 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml (recommended for subjects 1 year up to and including 15 years of age) or 720 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 20 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 1 ml (recommended from the age of 16 years onwards), the following adverse reactions have been reported.
In a clinical study, 102 subjects aged from 12 years up to and including 15 years received the second dose of Ambirix at month 12, seropositivity rates for anti-HAV were 99.0% and seropositivity rates for anti-HBs were 99.0% at month 13 with seroprotection rates of 97.0%.
When the first dose of Ambirix was administered concomitantly with a booster dose of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV/ Hib) or with the first dose of a combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in the second year of life, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory.

The most common side effects (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are reactions at the injection site, headache, somnolence (sleepiness), nausea (feeling sick), abdominal (tummy) pain, pelvic (lower abdominal) pain, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (e. g. feeling sick, weight gain, diarrhoea), ovarian cyst, and breast pain.
Due to the active substance zidovudine, Trizivir is contraindicated in patients with abnormally low neutrophil counts (< 0.75 x 109/ l), or abnormally low haemoglobin levels (< 7.5 g/ dl or 4.65 mmol/ l) (see section 4.4).
In populations similar to that enrolled in the PREDICT-1 study, it is estimated that 48% to 61% of patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele will develop a hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 0% to 4% of patients who do not have the HLA-B*5701 allele.
Other signs and symptoms may include respiratory signs and symptoms such as dyspnoea, sore throat, cough, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localised), gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain, and may lead to misdiagnosis of hypersensitivity as respiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis), or gastroenteritis.
Hypersensitivity reactions with rapid onset, including life-threatening reactions have occurred after restarting abacavir in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity (skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and malaise) prior to stopping abacavir.
Additionally dosage adjustment of zidovudine may be required if severe anaemia or myelosuppression occurs during treatment with Trizivir, or in patients with pre-existing bone marrow compromise e. g. haemoglobin < 9 g/ dl (5.59 mmol/ l) or neutrophil count < 1.0 x 109/ l (see section 4.2).
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive medicinal products (e. g. systemic pentamidine, dapsone, pyrimethamine, co-trimoxazole, amphotericin, flucytosine, ganciclovir, interferon, vincristine, vinblastine and doxorubicin) may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine.
Limited data from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine with co-trimoxazole (see interaction information above relating to lamivudine and cotrimoxazole) aerosolised pentamidine, pyrimethamine and acyclovir at doses used in prophylaxis.
To avoid a delay in diagnosis and minimise the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, Trizivir must be permanently discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (respiratory disease, flu-like illness, gastroenteritis or reactions to other medications).
Hypersensitivity reactions with rapid onset, including life-threatening reactions have occurred after restarting abacavir in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity (skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and malaise) prior to stopping abacavir.
Most patients experiencing virological failure with a regimen containing abacavir in a pivotal clinical trial with Combivir (fixed dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine) showed either no NRTI-related changes from baseline (15%) or only M184V or M184I selection (78%).
In a meta-analysis of five clinical trials where abacavir was added to intensify therapy, of 166 subjects, 123 (74%) had M184V/ I, 50 (30%) had T215Y/ F, 45 (27%) had M41L, 30 (18%) had K70R and 25 (15%) had D67N.
Logistic regression modelling of the predictive value for genotype (adjusted for baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA [vRNA], CD4+ cell count, number and duration of prior antiretroviral therapies) showed that the presence of 3 or more NRTI resistance-associated mutations was associated with reduced response at Week 4 (p=0.015) or 4 or more mutations at median Week 24 (p≤ 0.012).
Although a similar antiviral effect was observed between the abacavir and indinavir containing regimens in terms of proportion of patients with undetectable viral load (≤ 400 copies/ ml; intention to treat analysis (ITT), 47% versus 49%; as treated analysis (AT), 86% versus 94% for abacavir and indinavir combinations respectively), results favoured the indinavir combination, particularly in the subset of patients with high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ ml at baseline; ITT, 46% versus 55%; AT, 84% versus 93% for abacavir and indinavir respectively).
ACTG5095 was a randomised (1:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in 1147 antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected adults, comparing 3 regimens: zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC), efavirenz (EFV) vs ZDV/ 3TC/ EFV vs ZDV/ 3TC/ ABC.
After a median follow-up of 32 weeks, the tritherapy with the three nucleosides ZDV/ 3TC/ ABC was shown to be virologically inferior to the two other arms regardless of baseline viral load (< or > 100 000 copies/ml) with 26% of subjects on the ZDV/3TC/ABC arm, 16% on the ZDV/3TC/EFV arm and 13% on the 4 drug arm categorised as having virological failure (HIV RNA > 200 copies/ml).
In antiretroviral-naive patients treated with a combination of abacavir, lamivudine, zidovudine and efavirenz in a small, ongoing, open label pilot study, the proportion of patients with undetectable viral load (< 400 copies/ ml) was approximately 90% with 80% having < 50 copies/ ml after 24 weeks of treatment.
In a pharmacokinetic study in HIV-1 infected patients, the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine were similar when either Trizivir alone or the combination tablet lamivudine/ zidovudine and abacavir in combination were administered, and also similar to the values obtained in the bioequivalence study of Trizivir in healthy volunteers.
At a therapeutic dosage (one Trizivir tablet twice daily) in patients, the mean (CV) steady-state Cmax of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in plasma are 3.49 µg/ ml (45%), 1.33 µg/ ml (33%) and 1.56 µg/ ml (83%), respectively.
The mean (CV) AUCs for abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine over a dosing interval of 12 hours are 6.39 µg. h/ ml (31%), 5.73 µg. h/ ml (31%) and 1.50 µg. h/ ml (47%), respectively.

Symptoms almost always include fever or rash, but also very commonly include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, signs of liver damage in the blood, myalgia (muscle pain), dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), cough, lethargy and malaise (feeling unwell).
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Trizivir may be at risk of developing lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), immune reactivation syndrome (reactions to disease-causing organisms by the recovering immune system) and osteonecrosis (death of cells in the bone, which makes the bones fragile).
For liver transplants in adults, mycophenolate mofetil should be given as an infusion (drip into a vein) for the first four days after the transplant, before the patient is switched to 1.5 g Mycophenolate mofetil Teva twice a day as soon as it can be tolerated.

Children and adolescents: the recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/ m2 administered orally twice daily (up to a maximum of 2 g daily). Mycophenolate mofetil Teva capsules should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area of at least 1.25 m2.
Patients with a body surface area greater than 1.5 m2 may be prescribed Mycophenolate mofetil Teva capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). As some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with adults, temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction.
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including Mycophenolate mofetil Teva, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.
Because mycophenolate has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation, Mycophenolate mofetil Teva should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.
In view of the significant reduction in the AUC (area under the curve) of MPA by cholestyramine, caution should be used in the concomitant administration of Mycophenolate mofetil Teva with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Mycophenolate mofetil Teva.
Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in 4 the presence of renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir, or its prodrugs, e. g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in concentrations of both substances may occur.
Cholestyramine: following single dose administration 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects pre-treated with 4 g three times a day (TID) of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA (see section 4.4 and section 5.2).
Ganciclovir; based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate and intravenous ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co- administration of these agents (which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and mycophenolate mofetil dose adjustment is not required.
Rifampicin: in patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of Mycophenolate mofetil and rifampicin resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC 0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA exposure levels and to adjust Mycophenolate mofetil Teva doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin is administered concomitantly.
Sirolimus: in renal transplant patients, concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and CsA resulted in reduced MPA exposures by 30-50% compared with patients receiving the combination of sirolimus and similar doses of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4).
Sevelamer: decrease in MPA C max and AUC 0-12 by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i. e. graft rejection). It is recommended, however, to administer Mycophenolate mofetil Teva at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA.
However, in hepatic transplant patients, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g taken twice a day [BID], morning and evening]) were administered to patients taking tacrolimus (see also section 4.4).
Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.6% of patients receiving mycophenolate (2 g or 3 g daily) in combination with other immunosuppressants 6 in controlled clinical trials of renal (2 g data), cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year.
The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving mycophenolate (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials of renal (2 g data), cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, cytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia/ syndrome and Herpes simplex.
Within the system organ classes, undesirable effects are listed under headings of frequency, using the following categories: very common ( 1/ 10); common ( 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare ( 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare ( 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness
Agranulocytosis (uncommon) and neutropenia have been reported; therefore regular monitoring of patients taking Mycophenolate mofetil Teva is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow depression in patients treated with mycophenolate, some of which have been fatal.
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section 4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with Mycophenolate mofetil Teva should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see section 4.4).
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA is a potent, selective, uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA.
In a single dose study (6 subjects/ group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml min-1 1.73 m-2) were 28-75% higher relative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were unaffected by co-administration of mycophenolate (see also section 4.5). A study of the co-administration of mycophenolate (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives.
The highest dose tested in the animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or C max) observed in renal transplant patients as the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/ day and 1.3-2 times the systemic exposure (AUC or C max) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/ day.
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg kg-1 day-1. The systemic exposure at this dose represents 2-3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/ day in renal transplant patients and 1.3-2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/ day in cardiac transplant patients.
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 6 mg kg-1 day-1 (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg kg-1 day-1 (including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity.
Gastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical toxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see section 4.8).
Because mycophenolate has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation, Mycophenolate mofetil Teva should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.
In view of the significant reduction in the area under the curve (AUC) of MPA by cholestyramine, caution should be used in the concomitant administration of Mycophenolate mofetil Teva with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Mycophenolate mofetil Teva.

Although there were inconsistencies across studies in the results obtained with the different doses, in the two studies where Xeristar taken at a dose of 60 mg once a day was compared with placebo, symptom scores had fallen by around 9 points in the patients taking Xeristar after eight weeks, from a starting point of around 21 points.
Caution is advisable if XERISTAR is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like SSRIs, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum), venlafaxine or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.
Caution is advised if XERISTAR is co-administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as 6 nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).
Effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine Antacids and H2 antagonists: co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium- containing antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.
Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, agitation or anxiety, nausea and/ or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, diarrhoea, hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions.
Female rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/ kg/ day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

The most common side effects with PhotoBarr (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are dehydration, oesophageal stenosis (narrowing of the oesophagus), vomiting, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), constipation, nausea (feeling sick), photosensitivity reactions (sunburn-like reactions) and pyrexia (fever).
PhotoBarr must not be used in patients with porphyria (an inability to break down porphyrins), severe problems with the liver or kidneys, varices (swollen veins) in the oesophagus or stomach, large ulcers in the oesophagus, fistulae (abnormal passageways) between the oesophagus and either the trachea (windpipe) or the bronchi (airways in the lungs), or suspected damage to major blood vessels.
Repeat light application A second laser light application may be given to a previously treated segment that shows a'skip 'area, (i. e., an area that does not show sufficient mucosal response) using a short < 2.5 cm fibre optic diffuser at the light dose of 50 J/ cm of diffuser length (see Table 3).
Photosensitivity All patients who receive PhotoBarr will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid exposure of skin and eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light (from examination lamps, including dental lamps, operating room lamps, unshaded light bulbs at close proximity, neon lights, etc.) for at least 90 days after treatment, as some patients may remain photosensitive for up to 90 days or more.
It is possible that concomitant use of other photosensitising agents (e. g., tetracyclines, sulphonamides, phenothiazines, sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin and fluoroquinolones) could increase the photosensitivity reaction.

For metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum, Erbitux was studied in five main studies: • two studies involved 1,535 patients who had not received chemotherapy before, looking at the effects of adding Erbitux to a treatment combination containing either irinotecan or oxaliplatin; • three studies involved 2,199 patients whose disease had got worse while they were on previous treatment including irinotecan, oxaliplatin or both, or who could not receive these medicines.
For cancers of the head and neck, Erbitux was investigated in two main studies: • the first study involved 424 patients with locally advanced cancer, looking at the effects of adding Erbitux to radiotherapy; • the second study involved 442 patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer, looking at the effects of adding Erbitux to a platinum-based anticancer medicine combination.
In the studies of cancer of the colon or rectum, it took longer until the disease got worse in the patients with wild-type KRAS in their tumours when they received Erbitux: • in patients who had not received chemotherapy before, it took longer for the disease to get worse when they received Erbitux in addition to chemotherapy than when they did not add Erbitux.
This included chemotherapy including irinotecan (9.9 months compared with 8.7 months, on average) and including oxaliplatin (7.7 months compared with 7.2 months, on average) in patients who did not receive Erbitux. • the first study in patients who had taken chemotherapy before did not look at KRAS mutations.
The most common side effects with Erbitux (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are skin reactions such as rash, hypomagnesaemia (low blood magnesium levels), reactions linked to the infusion (such as fever, chills, dizziness and difficulty breathing), mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth) and raised levels of some liver enzymes.
While there was no specific safety signal in the 800 patients treated in combination with oestrogens, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine with other moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e. g. propranolol, grepafloxacine, enoxacine) until more experience has been gained (see section 4.4).
Adverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
In a specific study involving cirrhotic patients with chronic mild (Child-Pugh type A) or moderate (Child-Pugh type B) liver impairment, exposure to agomelatine 25 mg was substantially increased (70- times and 140-times, respectively), compared to matched volunteers (age, weight and smoking habit) with no liver failure (see section 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).
The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in the version 4.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in the module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

In the third study, the estimated risk of having a second attack of demyelination was lower in the patients taking Avonex than in the patients taking placebo: with Avonex, the risk was 21% in two years and 35% in three years, whereas the risk with placebo was 39% in two years and 50% in three years.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Avonex’ s benefits are greater than its risks for treatment of patients diagnosed with relapsing MS, or with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process if it is severe enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids.
• Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1).
Very common (≥ 1/ 10 patient-years); Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 patient-years); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1, 000 to < 1/ 100 patient-years); Rare (≥ 1/ 10, 000 to < 1/ 1,000 patient-years); Very rare (< 1/ 10,000 patient-years); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The effects of lyophilised AVONEX in the treatment of MS were demonstrated in a placebo- controlled study of 301 patients (AVONEX n=158, placebo n=143) with relapsing MS characterised by at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 3 years or at least one exacerbation per year prior to entry when the duration of the disease was less than 3 years.
A double-blind randomised dose comparison study of 802 relapsing MS patients (AVONEX 30 micrograms n=402, AVONEX 60 micrograms n=400) has shown no statistically significant differences or trends between the 30 micrograms and the 60 micrograms doses of AVONEX in clinical and general MRI parameters.
Furthermore, for the time-being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient although a more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least three months after the initial scan.

In clinical studies, the most common side effects with Nexavar (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were lymphopenia (low levels of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell), hypophosphataemia (low levels of phosphate in the blood), haemorrhage (bleeding), hypertension (high blood pressure), diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, rash, alopecia (hair loss), ‘ hand foot syndrome’ (rash and pain on the palms and soles), erythema (redness), pruritus (itchiness), fatigue (tiredness), pain, and increased amylase and lipase (enzymes produced by the pancreas).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Nexavar’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, and of advanced renal cell carcinoma in patients who have failed prior interferon alfa or interleukin-2 based therapy, or who are considered unsuitable for such therapy.
It cannot be excluded that sorafenib may increase the concentrations of concomitantly administered substrates of CYP2B6 (e. g. bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, ifosfamide, methadone) and CYP2C8 (e. g. paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide).
Docetaxel (75 or 100 mg/ m2 administered once every 21 days) when co-administered with sorafenib (200 mg twice daily or 400 mg twice daily administered on Days 2 through 19 of a 21-day cycle with a 3-day break in dosing around administration of docetaxel) resulted in a 36-80% increase in docetaxel AUC and a 16-32% increase in docetaxel Cmax.

 Hypersensitivity and antibody formation  Embryo-foetotoxicity and the need for women with childbearing potential to use effective contraception for 2 years following implant  the risks of ectopic bone formation  interaction with bone void fillers  that the product should only be used once
It must not be used in the following groups:  patients with an auto-immune disease (a disease caused by the body’ s own defence system attacking normal tissue);  patients who have an active infection at the operation site or have had repeated infections;  patients who do not have adequate skin covering or blood supply at the operation site;  patients who have received a medicine containing BMP in the past;  patients with cancer or being treated for cancer;  patients whose bones are still growing such as children and adolescents.
Trevaclyn is indicated for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, particularly in patients with combined mixed dyslipidaemia (characterised by elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol) and in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial).
Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-disposing factors for rhabdomyolysis. • Age > 70 years • Renal impairment • Uncontrolled hypothyroidism • Personal or familial history of hereditary muscular disorders • Previous history of muscular toxicity with a statin or fibrate • Alcohol abuse.
4 Acute coronary syndrome As with other nicotinic acid medicinal products, caution should be used when Trevaclyn is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of an MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive medicinal products such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or adrenergic blocking agents.
In these studies, the percentage of patients taking Trevaclyn, nicotinic acid (pooled prolonged-release formulations) or pooled placebo/ simvastatin who discontinued due to any flushing-related symptom (redness, warmth, itching and tingling) was 7.2%, 16.6%, and 0.4%, respectively.
7 Overall adverse reactions with Trevaclyn In addition to flushing, clinical adverse reactions reported by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely related to Trevaclyn in ≥ 1% of patients treated with Trevaclyn alone (n=947) or co-administered with statin (n=1601) and clinically meaningful adverse reactions (< 1%), for up to one year are listed below.
An apparent hypersensitivity reaction has been reported (< 1%) This is characterised by multiple symptoms that may include: angio-oedema, pruritus, erythema, paraesthesia, loss of consciousness, vomiting, urticaria, flushing, dyspnoea, nausea, incontinence of urine and stool, cold sweats, shivering, chills, increased blood pressure, lip swelling, burning sensation, drug eruption, arthralgia, leg swelling, and tachycardia.
Nicotinic acid-related adverse reactions The following nicotinic acid-related adverse reactions have been seen in clinical trials or post-marketing experience with other nicotinic acid medicinal products at unknown frequency or in clinical trials with Trevaclyn (or the nicotinic acid component of Trevaclyn) in < 1% of the patients treated:
The most commonly reported adverse reactions from the subjects who received this higher dose were consistent with a high dose of nicotinic acid and included: flushing, headache, pruritus, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric and abdominal pain/ discomfort, and back pain.
Nicotinic acid lowers the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B, the major LDL protein), triglycerides (TG), and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a), a modified LDL particle) and elevates the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I, the major protein component of HDL).
Nicotinic acid inhibits release of free fatty acids (FFA) from adipose tissue, which may contribute to the reduced plasma LDL-C, TC, VLDL-C, apo B, TG, and Lp(a), as well as elevated HDL-C, and apo A-I, all of which are associated with lower cardiovascular risk.
Patients receiving Trevaclyn, nicotinic acid (prolonged-released formulation), or placebo were also taking statins (29% atorvastatin [5-80 mg], 54% simvastatin [10-80 mg], 17% other statins [2.5-180 mg] (pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin)), of which 9% were also taking ezetimibe [10 mg].
In a multicentre, double-blind, 12-week factorial study, Trevaclyn 1000 mg/ 20 mg co-administered with simvastatin, when compared with simvastatin alone or Trevaclyn 1000 mg/ 20 mg alone, for 4 weeks, significantly lowered LDL-C (-44.2%, -37.4%, -8.2% respectively), TG (-25.8%, -15.7%, -18.7% respectively), TC (-27.9%, -25.8%, -4.9% respectively) and significantly increased HDL-C (19.2%, 4.2%, 12.5% respectively).
Trevaclyn (2000 mg/ 40 mg) co-administered with simvastatin when compared with simvastatin alone or Trevaclyn (2000 mg/ 40 mg) alone for 12 weeks, significantly lowered LDL-C (-47.9%, -37.0%, -17.0% respectively), TG (-33.3%, -14.7%, -21.6% respectively), apo B
11 (-41.0%, -28.8%, -17.1% respectively), and TC (-29.6%, -24.9%, -9.1% respectively), as well as LDL-C: HDL-C (-57.1%, -39.8%, -31.2% respectively), non-HDL-C (-45.8%, -33.4%, -18.1% respectively), and TC: HDL-C (-43.0%, -28.0%, -24.9% respectively), and significantly increased HDL-C (27.5%, 6.0%, 23.4% respectively).
In patients continuing in the first study (24 weeks), the frequency of moderate or greater flushing in patients treated with Trevaclyn declined and approached that of patients receiving placebo (see Figure 1), whereas in patients treated with nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation) the flushing frequency remained constant (after Week 6).
● Trevaclyn (1000 mg/ 20 mg to 2000 mg/ 40 mg at week 5) ▲ Nicotinic acid (prolonged-release 1000 mg to 2000 mg at week 5) ○ Placebo *Includes patients with moderate, severe, or extreme flushing symptoms † Dose advancement at Week 5
In the second study (16 weeks) where acetylsalicylic acid was allowed, patients taking Trevaclyn experienced significantly fewer days per week with moderate or greater flushing compared to nicotinic acid (prolonged-release formulation taken as a 12-week multi-step 500 mg to 2000 mg titration) (p < 0.001).
Absorption Nicotinic acid Following a 2000 mg dose of nicotinic acid administered orally as two modified-release tablets of nicotinic acid/ laropiprant with food, nicotinic acid was absorbed with a median time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of 4 hours, a mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-last) of approximately 58.0 μ M·hr and a mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of approximately 20.2 μ M.
Laropiprant Following a 40 mg dose of laropiprant administered orally as two modified-release tablets of nicotinic acid/ laropiprant with food, laropiprant is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1 hour, a mean AUC0-∞ of approximately 13 μ M·hr, and a mean Cmax of approximately 1.6 μ M.
In in vitro studies, nicotinic acid and its metabolites did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4-mediated reactions or UGT1A1-mediated 3-glucuronidation of estradiol.
Reproduction toxicity studies showed slight treatment-related decreases in mean maternal weight gain and foetal body weight, slight increases in pup mortality, and increased incidence of supernumerary rib and incomplete ossification of the sternebra in the foetus were observed in rats at systemic exposure levels at least 513 times the human exposure based on the AUC of the recommended daily human dose.

Trevaclyn is used if you need to improve cholesterol and fat levels in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia): • when you cannot control your cholesterol levels with a statin (class of cholesterol-lowering medicines working in the liver); • when you cannot tolerate a statin or when a statin is not recommended for you.
Do not take Trevaclyn if • you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nicotinic acid, to laropiprant, or to any of the other ingredients of Trevaclyn (listed in section 6). • you currently have liver problems. • you have an ulcer in your stomach. • you have arterial bleeding.
Check with your doctor or pharmacist before and while taking your medicine if: • you have any allergies. • you have ever had liver disease, jaundice (a liver disorder causing yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), or hepatobiliary (liver and bile duct) disease. • you have kidney problems. • you have thyroid problems. • you drink large amounts of alcohol. • you or close family members have a hereditary muscle disorder, or you have ever had muscle problems during treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines called “ statins” or fibrates. • you have unexplained muscle pain, muscle tenderness, or muscle weakness.
Blood tests and monitoring • See your doctor regularly to check your LDL (bad) and HDL (good) cholesterol levels and your triglyceride level. • Your doctor should do a blood test before you start taking Trevaclyn to check how well your liver is working. • Your doctor may also want you to periodically have blood tests after you start taking Trevaclyn, to check how well your liver is working and for other side effects.
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: • medicines used to lower blood pressure. • medicines used to lower cholesterol called ‘ statins’, a class of medicine that works in the liver. • medicines used to lower cholesterol called ‘ bile acid sequestrants’, such as colestyramine. • zidovudine, a medicine used for HIV. • midazolam, a medicine to make you sleepy before some medical procedures. • vitamins or supplements that contain nicotinic acid. • clopidogrel, a medicine to help prevent harmful blood clots.
If you take more Trevaclyn than you should • In the event of an overdose, the following adverse events were reported: flushing, headache, pruritus (itching), nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain/ discomfort, and back pain. • If you take more than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away.
Common (affects less than 1 in 10 patients) • diarrhoea • nausea (feeling sick) • dizziness • rash • pruritus (itching) • hives • upset stomach or heartburn • getting sick (vomiting) • headache • tingling or numbness of the hands or feet

Further to discussions at the CHMP October 2004 plenary meeting, the European Commission recommended that this public health issue on all aspects of cardiovascular safety including thrombotic events and cardio-renal events is the subject of Community referrals under Article 31 of Directive 2001/ 83/ EC, as amended regarding decentrally authorised products containing celecoxib, etoricoxib and lumiracoxib and subject to a review procedure under Article 18 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/ 93, as amended regarding the centrally authorised products containing celecoxib (Onsenal), parecoxib (Dynastat/ Rayzon) and valdecoxib (Bextra/ Valdyn), which were started in November 2004.
On 7 April 2005, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the EMEA requested that Pfizer voluntarily withdraw Bextra (valdecoxib) from the market and Pfizer agreed to suspend sale and marketing of Bextra worldwide pending further discussions on the unfavorable risk versus benefit due to data on serious skin reactions.
Experience with celecoxib in FAP patients below the age of 18 years is limited to a single pilot study in a very small population, in which patients were treated with celecoxib at doses up to 16 mg/ kg daily, which corresponds to the recommended adult FAP dose of 800 mg daily (see section 5.1).
2 • Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). • Known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides. • Active peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. • Patients who have experienced asthma, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including COX-2 (cyclooxigenase-2) selective inhibitors. • In pregnancy and in women who can become pregnant unless using an effective method of contraception (see sections 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3) • Breast feeding (see sections 4.6 and 5.3) • Severe hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin< 25 g/l or Child-Pugh score > 10) (Class C). • Patients with renal insufficiency with estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min. • Inflammatory bowel disease. • Congestive heart failure (NYHA II-IV). • Established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and/or cerebrovascular disease
Blood and lymphatic system disorder / Cardio-vascular disorder Increased number of serious cardiovascular events, mainly myocardial infarction, has been found in a long- term placebo-controlled study in subjects with sporadic adenomatous polyps treated with celecoxib at doses of 200 mg BID and 400 mg BID compared to placebo (see section 5.1).
As the cardiovascular risks of celecoxib were increased with the 400 mg twice daily dose in the APC trial (section 5.1), the response of the FAP patient to celecoxib should be re-examined periodically in order to avoid unnecessary exposure in FAP patients for whom celecoxib is not effective (sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.1)
As for NSAIDs, the risk of acute renal insufficiency, which is usually reversible, may be increased in some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients) when ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists are combined with NSAIDs, including celecoxib.
In a 28-day clinical study in patients with lisinopril-controlled Stage I and II hypertension, administration of celecoxib 200 mg BID resulted in no clinically significant increases, when compared to placebo treatment, in mean daily systolic or diastolic blood pressure as determined using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
Among patients treated with celecoxib 200 mg BID, 48% were considered unresponsive to lisinopril at the final clinic visit (defined as either cuff diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg or cuff diastolic blood pressure increased > 10% compared to baseline), compared to 27% of patients treated with placebo; this difference was statistically significant.
2 In a pooled analysis of 20 placebo-controlled studies with duration greater than 2 weeks up to 1 year in patients with OA and RA, the excess rate of myocardial infarction in patients treated with celecoxib 200 or 400 mg daily over placebo was 0.7 events per 1000 patients (Rare) and there was no excess of strokes.
The additional adverse reactions listed by system organ class and ranked by frequency in Table 2 were reported at incidence rates greater than placebo for subjects treated with celecoxib 400 mg to 800 mg daily in long-term polyp prevention trials of duration up to 3 years (the APC and PreSAP trials; see Section 5.1, Pharmacodynamic properties:
In final data (adjudicated) from the APC trial in patients treated with celecoxib 800 mg daily for up to 3 years, the excess rates over placebo were 11 events per 1000 patients for myocardial infarction (common); and 5 events per 1000 patients for stroke (uncommon; types of stroke not differentiated).
Celecoxib is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole, chemically similar to other non-arylamine sulfonamides (e. g. thiazides, furosemide) but differing from arylamine sulfonamides (e. g. sulfamethoxizole and other sulfonamide antibiotics).
A total of 18 children 10 to 14 years of age who had genotype or phenotype positive FAP were treated with celecoxib 4 mg/ kg/ day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients treated with placebo), celecoxib 8 mg/ kg/ day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients treated with placebo), or celecoxib 16 mg/ kg/ day (4 patients, compared to 2 patients treated with placebo).
In the APC trial, the relative risks compared to placebo for a composite endpoint (adjudicated) of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 - 8.5) with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 - 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily.
11 In a pharmacokinetic study of celecoxib 200 mg administered once daily in healthy volunteers, genotyped as either CYP2C9*1/ *1, CYP2C9*1/ *3, or CYP2C9*3/ *3, the median Cmax and AUC 0-24 of celecoxib on day 7 were approximately 4-fold and 7-fold, respectively, in subjects genotyped as CYP2C9*3/ *3 compared to other genotypes.
Conventional embryo-foetal toxicity studies resulted in dose dependent occurrences of diaphragmatic hernia in rat foetuses and of cardiovascular malformations in rabbit foetuses at systemic exposures to free celecoxib approximately 3 times (rat) and 2 times (rabbit) higher than those achieved at the recommended daily human dose (800 mg).
Experience with celecoxib in FAP patients below the age of 18 years is limited to a single pilot study in a very small population, in which patients were treated with celecoxib at doses up to 16 mg/ kg daily, which corresponds to the recommended adult FAP dose of 800 mg daily (see section 5.1).

CRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with amiodarone, terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), pimozide, ergot derivatives, simvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.4).
3 In addition, indinavir with ritonavir should not be administered with alfuzosin, meperidine, piroxicam, propoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, flecanide, propafenone, quinidine, fusidic acid, clozapine, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam.
Co– administration of CRIXIVAN with sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil (PDE5 inhibitors) are expected to substantially increase the plasma concentrations of these compounds and may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor– associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism (see section 4.5).
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
CRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with amiodarone, terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see Table 1 and 2 below), pimozide, ergot derivatives, simvastatin or lovastatin.
In addition, indinavir with ritonavir should not be administered with alfuzosin, meperidine, piroxicam, propoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, flecanide, propafenone, quinidine, fusidic acid, clozapine, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam.
Interactions between indinavir and other medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change (≤ +/ - 20%) as “↔”, single dose as “ SD”, once daily as “ QD”, twice daily as “ BID”, three times daily as “ TID”, and four times as "QID").

Cyclosporine A Following initiation of indinavir/ ritonavir (Indinavir/ ritonavir 800/ 100 800/ 100 BID or lopinavir/ ritonavir 400/ 100 BID) BID, dose reduction of cyclosporine A to 5- 20% of prior dose was needed to maintain cyclosporine A levels within therapeutic range in one study.
In controlled clinical trials conducted world– wide, indinavir was administered alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents (zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, and/ or lamivudine) to approximately 2,000 patients, the majority of whom were adult Caucasian males (15% females).
These adverse reactions were: nausea (35.3%), headache (25.2%), diarrhoea (24.6%), asthenia/ fatigue (24.3%), rash (19.1%), taste perversion (19.1%), dry skin (16.2%), abdominal pain (14.6%), vomiting (11.0%), dizziness (10.7%).
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); Common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); Very rare (< 1/ 10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
In clinical trials in paediatric patients 3 years of age and older, the adverse experience profile was similar to that for adult patients except for a higher frequency of nephrolithiasis of 29% (20/ 70) in paediatric patients who were treated with CRIXIVAN at the recommended dose of 500 mg/ m2 every 8 hours.
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal fat and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Hepato-biliary disorders: isolated asymptomatic hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin ≥ 2.5 mg/ dl, 43 mcmol/ l), reported predominantly as elevated indirect bilirubin and rarely associated with elevations in ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase, has occurred in approximately 14% of patients treated with CRIXIVAN alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
Microbiology Indinavir at concentrations of 50 to 100 nM mediated 95% inhibition (IC95) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus– infected control) in human T– lymphoid cell cultures and primary human monocytes/ macrophages infected with HIV− 1 variants LAI, MN, RF, and a macrophage– tropic variant SF– 162, respectively.
Indinavir at concentrations of 25 to 100 nM mediated 95% inhibition of viral spread in cultures of mitogen– activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical isolates of HIV− 1, including isolates resistant to zidovudine and non– nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).
AUC0-8h of 27,813 nM*h (90% confidence interval = 22,185, 34,869), peak plasma concentrations 11,144 nM (90% confidence interval = 9,192, 13,512) and plasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose 211 nM (90% confidence interval = 163, 274).

Pharmacokinetic analysis in one study was performed on nineteen of the patients, with a median (range) indinavir AUC 0-12hr, Cmax, and Cmin of 25421 nM*h (21489-36236 nM*h), 5758 nM (5056-6742 nM) and 239 (169-421 nM), respectively.
In HIV− infected paediatric patients, a dosage regimen of indinavir hard capsules, 500 mg/ m2 every 8 hours, produced AUC0– 8hr values of 27,412 nM*h, peak plasma concentrations of 12,182 nM, and plasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose of 122 nM.
Biotransformation Seven major metabolites were identified and the metabolic pathways were identified as glucuronidation at the pyridine nitrogen, pyridine– N– oxidation with and without 3’– hydroxylation on the indane ring, 3’– hydroxylation of indane, p– hydroxylation of phenylmethyl moiety, and N– depyridomethylation with and without the 3’– hydroxylation.

The most common side effects when taking Crixivan (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are headache, dizziness, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia (heartburn), rash, dry skin, asthenia (weakness), fatigue (tiredness), taste perversion (an unusual taste in the mouth), and abdominal (tummy) pain.
Crixivan should not be used in patients who are taking any of the following medicines: • medicines that are broken down in the same way as Crixivan and are harmful at high levels in the blood; • amiodarone (used to correct irregular heartbeat); • terfenadine, astemizole (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms – these medicines may be available without a prescription); • cisapride (used to treat certain stomach problems); • alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam taken by mouth (used to treat anxiety or difficulty sleeping); • pimozide (used to treat mental illness); • ergot derivatives (used to treat migraine headache); • simvastatin, lovastatin (used to lower cholesterol in the blood); • rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis); • St John ’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression).
Betaine was rapidly distributed into a relatively large volume (V/ F = 1.3 l/ kg), with a slow elimination rate (mean half life = 14 h, mean total body clearance, CL/ F, = 84 ml/ h/ kg), renal clearance being negligible (5% of total body clearance), assuming 100% bioavailability.
The following side effects were reported as follows: very common (more than 1 out of 10 persons), common (more than 1 out of 100 persons and less than 1 out of 10 persons), uncommon (more than 1 out of 1,000 persons and less than 1 out of 100 persons), rare (more than 1 out of 10,000 persons and less than 1 out of 1,000 persons), very rare (less than 1 out of 10,000 persons).
17 Uncommon: decreased appetite, agitation, depression, irritability, personality disorder, sleep disturbance, oedema of the brain (see heading “Take special care with Cystadane” in section 2), dental disorders, diarrhoea, inflammation of the tongue, nausea, stomach discomfort, vomiting, hair loss, hives, skin odour abnormality and urinary incontinence.
Cystadane is used in patients with all three known types of homocystinuria, caused by a lack of the substances required for the breakdown of methionine (‘ cystathionine beta-synthase’ [CBS] or ‘ 5,10- methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase’ [MTHFR]), or by defects in ‘ cobalamin cofactor metabolism’ (cbl).

The most common side effects with Zonegran (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are anorexia (loss of appetite), agitation, irritability, confusion, depression, ataxia (inability to co-ordinate muscle movements), dizziness, memory impairment, somnolence (sleepiness), diplopia (double vision) and decreased blood bicarbonate levels.
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes show no or little (< 25%) inhibition of cytochrome P450 isozymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4 at zonisamide levels approximately two- fold or greater than clinically relevant unbound serum concentrations.
These effects are unlikely to be of clinical significance when Zonegran is added to existing therapy; however, changes in zonisamide concentrations may occur if concomitant CYP3A4-inducing anti-epileptic or other medicinal products are withdrawn, dose adjusted or introduced, an adjustment of the Zonegran dose may be required.

The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Zeffix’ s benefits are greater than its risks for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum ALT levels and histological evidence of active liver inflammation and/ or fibrosis, and in adults with decompensated liver disease.
• In patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment should be administered for at least 3-6 months after HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg and HBV DNA loss with HBeAb detection) is confirmed, to limit the risk of virological relapse, or until HBsAg seroconversion.
Treatment discontinuation may be considered following HBsAg seroconversion. • In patients with either HBeAg positive or HBeAg negative CHB, the development of YMDD variant HBV may result in a diminished therapeutic response to lamivudine, indicated by a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from previous on-treatment levels.
For the treatment of patients who are co-infected with HIV and are currently receiving or plan to receive treatment with lamivudine or the combination lamivudine-zidovudine, the dose of lamivudine prescribed for HIV infection (usually 150 mg/ twice daily in combination with other antiretrovirals) should be maintained.
Experience in patients with HBeAg positive CHB and compensated liver disease: in controlled studies, 1 year of lamivudine therapy significantly suppressed HBV DNA replication [34-57% of patients were below the assay detection limits (Abbott Genostics solution hybridization assay, LLOD < 1.6pg/ ml)}, normalised ALT level (40-72% of patients), induced HBeAg seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBeAb detection with HBV DNA loss [by conventional assay], 16-18% of patients), improved histology (38-52% of patients had a ≥ 2 point decrease in the Knodell Histologic Activity Index [HAI]) and reduced progression of fibrosis (in 3-17% of patients) and progression to cirrhosis.
Experience in patients with HBeAg negative CHB: initial data indicate the efficacy of lamivudine in patients with HBeAg negative CHB is similar to patients with HBeAg positive CHB, with 71% of patients having HBV DNA suppressed below the detection limit of the assay, 67% ALT normalisation and 38% with improvement in HAI after one year of treatment.
In a double-blind study in CHB patients with YMDD variant HBV and compensated liver disease (NUC20904), with a reduced virological and biochemical response to lamivudine (n=95), the addition of adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily to ongoing lamivudine 100mg for 52 weeks resulted in a median decrease in HBV DNA of 4.6 log10 copies/ ml compared to a median increase of 0.3 log10 copies/ ml in those patients receiving lamivudine monotherapy.
Experience in CHB patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis: in a placebo-controlled study in 651 patients with clinically compensated chronic hepatitis B and histologically confirmed fibrosis or cirrhosis, lamivudine treatment (median duration 32 months) significantly reduced the rate of overall disease progression (34/ 436, 7.8% for lamivudine versus 38/ 215, 17.7% for placebo, p=0.001), demonstrated by a significant reduction in the proportion of patients having increased Child-Pugh scores (15/ 436, 3.4% versus 19/ 215, 8.8%, p=0.023) or developing hepatocellular carcinoma (17/ 436, 3.9% versus 16/ 215, 7.4%, p=0.047).
Confirmed HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 47% (118/ 252) of subjects treated with lamivudine and 93% (320/ 345) of subjects receiving lamivudine became HBV DNA negative (VERSANT [version 1], bDNA assay, LLOD < 0.7 MEq/ ml) during the study.
The difference in the HBeAg seroconversion rates (HBeAg and HBV DNA loss with HBeAb detection) between placebo and lamivudine was not statistically significant in this population (rates after one year were 13% (12/ 95) for placebo versus 22% (42/ 191) for lamivudine; p=0.057).

Significant cardiovascular disease, e. g. congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II, III or IV), severe angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction within a 3 month period prior to treatment, venous thrombosis, occlusive peripheral arterial disease, recent pulmonary embolism.
Potential leakage should be measured by radioactively labelled albumin or erythrocytes injected into the perfusion circuit, with appropriate measures for continuous monitoring of radioactivity leakage into the systemic circulation (Hoekstra HJ, Naujocks T, Schraffordt Koops H, Beekhuis H, van Groningen a Stuling R, ter Veen H, et. al..
Proliferation of activated B- and T-lymphocytes, development of cytotoxic T cells and immunoglobulin-secreting cells is enhanced, monocytes/ macrophages are activated for killing of tumour cells, granulocytes are activated to display enhanced phagocytic activity, respiratory burst and degranulation, and adherence to endothelium.
BEROMUN is supplied as a powder and solvent for solution for infusion, in cartons of four glass vials, each containing 1 mg (3.0-6.0 x 107 IU) of the active substance tasonermin, together with four glass ampoules containing sterile sodium chloride solution (physiological saline) for dissolving the contents of the glass vials.
In the unlikely event that your doctor believes you have suffered, or might suffer, dangerous side- effects due either to overdose or systemic leakage, you will be immediately transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) within the hospital, where your doctor can more closely monitor you and prescribe suitable treatment to deal with any dangerous side-effects which have developed.
If your doctor notices that you are suffering from, or are likely to suffer from, any of these severe side- effects described above, you will be immediately transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) within the hospital, where your doctor can more closely monitor you and prescribe suitable treatment to deal with any dangerous side-effects which have developed.
Beromun is used in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (a type of cancer) of the limb (arm or leg), together with melphalan (an anticancer medicine), using a technique called ‘ isolated limb perfusion’ (ILP): both medicines are injected into the limb while the blood circulation in the limb is kept isolated (cut off) from the rest of the body.
Other side effects seen very commonly (in more than 1 patient in 10) are infection, cardiac arrhythmia (unstable heartbeat), nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, liver damage, fatigue (tiredness), chills, pain in the limb, nerve injury, skin reactions, oedema (swelling) and wound infection.
It must not be used in patients with significant cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease, severe lung disease, a recent or active stomach ulcer, severe ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), blood disorders, kidney or liver disease, or hypercalcaemia (high blood calcium levels), or in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Beromun’ s benefits are greater than its risks as an adjunct to surgery for subsequent removal of the tumour so as to prevent or delay amputation, or in the palliative situation, for irresectable soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs, used in combination with melphalan via mild hyperthermic ILP.
Some cancer patients receive high doses, and, because of this, can experience toxic effects, such as damage to the kidneys, bone marrow suppression (leading to anaemia, an increased risk of infection and bleeding) and mucositis (an inflammation of the mucosa, the lining of organs such as the mouth, with soreness, redness and ulceration).
Voraxaze would have been used either as a treatment in patients who had developed such toxic effects, or as prevention in patients who were at risk of developing them, such as patients who have high levels of methotrexate in their blood, or those who have poorly functioning kidneys (when methotrexate may be eliminated more slowly).
Based on the review of the data and the company’ s response to the CHMP list of questions at the time of the withdrawal, the CHMP had some concerns and was of the provisional opinion that Voraxaze could not have been approved for the adjunctive treatment of patients experiencing or at risk of methotrexate toxicity.

In view of the significant reduction in the AUC (area under the curve) of MPA by cholestyramine, caution should be used in the concomitant administration of Myfenax with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfenax.
Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir, or its prodrugs, e. g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in concentrations of both substances may occur.
Cholestyramine: following single dose administration 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects pre-treated with 4 g three times a day (TID )of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA (see section 4.4 and section 5.2).
Ganciclovir; based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate and intravenous ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co- administration of these agents (which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration.
However, in hepatic transplant patients, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g taken twice [BID] a day, morning and evening]) were administered to patients taking tacrolimus (see also section 4.4).
The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving mycophenolate (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials of renal (2 g data), cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, cytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia/ syndrome and Herpes simplex.
Within the system organ classes, undesirable effects are listed under headings of frequency, using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (≤ 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, peritonitis, ileus, colitis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, oesophagitis, stomatitis, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, eructation
Sepsis, gastrointestinal candidiasis, urinary tract infection, herpes simplex, herpes zoster Pneumonia, influenza, respiratory tract infection, respiratory moniliasis, gastrointestinal infection, candidiasis, gastroenteritis, infection, bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, fungal skin infection, skin candida, vaginal candidiasis, rhinitis
A study of the co administration of mycophenolate (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives.
The highest dose tested in the animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in renal transplant patients as the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/ day and 1.3-2 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/ day.
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 6 mg kg-1 day-1 (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg kg-1 day-1 (including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity.

Sirolimus: in renal transplant patients, concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and CsA resulted in reduced MPA exposures by 30-50% compared with patients receiving the combination of sirolimus and similar doses of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4).
However, in hepatic transplant patients, there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g taken twice a day, morning and evening[BID) were administered to patients taking tacrolimus (see also section 4.4).

Agranulocytosis (uncommon) and neutropenia have been reported; therefore regular monitoring of patients taking Myfenax is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow depression in patients treated with mycophenolate, some of which have been fatal.
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section 4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with Myfenax should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see section 4.4).
A study of the co administration of mycophenolate (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.15 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral contraceptives.

In addition, more than 1 patient in 100 with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease have the following side effects: hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels), orthostatic dizziness (dizziness when standing up), musculoskeletal (joint) pain and orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up).
General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure.
Diuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Karvea has been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics.
Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i. e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Paediatric patients: in a randomised trial of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following related adverse events occurred in the 3-week double-blind phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%), cough (0.9%).
In patients not adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/ 3-6 mm Hg (systolic/ diastolic).
Reduction of blood pressure with 0.5 mg/ kg (low), 1.5 mg/ kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/ kg (high) target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family history of hypertension) children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period.
Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).
Patients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (e. g., diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of ≤ 135/ 85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was > 160 mmHg.
Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine (p = 0.006)].
As for the secondary endpoint of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups in the overall population, although an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo- based regimen.
While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/ kg/ day) degenerative changes in the kidney (such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion.

It must not be used in patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones and acids in the blood), diabetic pre-coma, problems with their kidneys or liver, conditions that may affect the kidneys, or a disease that causes a reduced supply of oxygen to the tissues such as failure of the heart or lungs or a recent heart attack.
Therefore, the Committee decided that the benefits of Zomarist are greater than its risks for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral metformin alone or who are already treated with the combination of vildagliptin and metformin as separate tablets.
2 Hepatic impairment Zomarist should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment, including those with pre-treatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8).
 Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients  Diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma  Renal failure or renal dysfunction defined as creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min (see section 4.4)  Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function, such as:
In data from controlled monotherapy and add-on therapy trials of up to 24 weeks in duration, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3x ULN (classified as present on at least 2 consecutive measurements or at the final on-treatment visit) was 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.2% for vildagliptin 50 mg once daily, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily and all comparators, respectively.
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100, < 1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000, < 1/100); rare (≥1/10,000, < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
In comparative controlled monotherapy studies, hypoglycaemia was uncommon, reported in 0.4% (7 of 1,855) of patients treated with vildagliptin 100 mg daily compared to 0.2% (2 of 1,082) of patients in the groups treated with an active comparator or placebo, with no serious or severe events reported.
Zomarist combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complimentary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: vildagliptin, a member of the islet enhancer class, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
Vildagliptin added to patients whose glycaemic control was not satisfactory despite treatment with metformin monotherapy resulted after 6-month treatment in additional statistically significant mean reductions in HbA 1c compared to placebo (between group differences of -0.7% to -1.1% for vildagliptin 50 mg and 100 mg, respectively).

Luminity is an ultrasound contrast-enhancing agent for use in patients in whom non-contrast echocardiography was suboptimal (suboptimal is considered to indicate that at least two of six segments in the 4- or 2-chamber view of the ventricular border were not evaluable) and who have suspected or established coronary artery disease, to provide opacification of cardiac chambers and improvement of left ventricular endocardial border delineation at both rest and stress.
These states include adult respiratory distress syndrome, severe heart failure (NYHA IV), endocarditis, acute myocardial infarction with on-going angina or unstable angina, hearts with prosthetic valves, acute states of systemic inflammation or sepsis, known states of hyperactive coagulation system and/ or recurrent thromboembolism.
Allergic type reactions (eg: anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid type reactions, hypotension and angioedema) (see section 4.4) Central nervous system reactions (including seizures and seizure-like reactions), which may be associated with immediate hypersensitivity reactions Muscle spasm, musculoskeletal pain and discomfort, and myalgia.

Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over): one dose of Aerius oral lyophilisate placed in the mouth once a day for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over): two 2.5 mg Aerius orodispersible tablets placed in the mouth once a day for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).
The prevalence of this poor metaboliser phenotype was comparable for adult (6%) and paediatric subjects 2- to 11-year old (6%), and greater among Blacks (18% adult, 16% paediatric) than Caucasians (2% adult, 3% paediatric) in both populations however the safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general population.
Aerius 2.5 mg tablets has not been evaluated in paediatric patients however in conjunction with the dose finding studies in paediatrics, the pharmacokinetics data for Aerius orodispersible tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dose in paediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age.
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over): one 5 mg Aerius orodispersible tablet placed in the mouth once a day for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).

In the comparative study, Fasturtec was more effective than allopurinol: over the first 96 hours after treatment, patients treated with Fasturtec had a lower average blood level of uric acid compared that in the patients treated with allopurinol (128.1 and 328.5 mg. h/ dl, respectively).
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Fasturtec’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment and prophylaxis of acute hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent acute renal failure, in patients with haematological malignancy with a high tumour burden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy.
In adults, the most common side effects (seen in more than 20% of patients) were constipation, urinary tract infections (infection of the structures that carry urine), pain, nausea (feeling sick), peripheral oedema (swelling), hypertension (high blood pressure), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), headache, hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels), hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol levels), surgical wound complication, weight increase, increased serum creatinine (a marker of kidney problems), hypophosphataemia (low blood phosphate levels), diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infection (colds).
In children, the side effects seen in more than 20% of patients were urinary tract infections, hypertrichosis (excess body hair), rhinitis (stuffy and runny nose), pyrexia (fever), hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, sepsis (blood infection) and constipation.
It is to be used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion- and corticosteroid-based immunosuppression, in patients with panel reactive antibodies less than 80%, or in a triple maintenance immunosuppressive regimen containing ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.
In the original phase III studies during the first 3 months post-transplantation, 14% of patients in the basiliximab group and 27% of patients in the placebo group had an acute rejection episode treated with antibody therapy (OKT 3 or antithymocyte globulin/ antilymphocyte globulin (ATG/ ALG)), with no increase in adverse events or infections in the basiliximab group as compared to placebo.
Basiliximab has been tested in four randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in renal transplant recipients as an induction agent in combination with the following immunosuppressive regimens: ciclosporin for microemulsion and corticosteroids in two studies (346 and 380 patients), ciclosporin for microemulsion, azathioprine and corticosteroids in one study (340 patients), and ciclosporin for microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids in another study (123 patients).
Adult patients The most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual or triple therapy in both treatment groups (basiliximab vs. placebo) were constipation, urinary tract infection, pain, nausea, peripheral oedema, hypertension, anaemia, headache, hyperkalaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, postoperative wound complication, weight increase, increase in blood creatinine, hypophosphataemia, diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infection.
Paediatric patients The most commonly reported (> 20%) events following dual therapy in both (< 35 kg vs. ≥ 35 kg weight) cohorts were urinary tract infection, hypertrichosis, rhinitis, pyrexia, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infection, sepsis and constipation.
Post-marketing adverse reactions Hypersensitivity/ anaphylactoid reactions such as rash, urticaria, sneezing, wheezing, bronchospasm, pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, respiratory failure and capillary leak syndrome (see section 4.4), and cytokine release syndrome have been reported during post-marketing experience with Simulect.
Basiliximab specifically binds with high affinity (KD-value 0.1 nM) to the CD25 antigen on activated T-lymphocytes expressing the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL- 2R) and thereby prevents binding of interleukin-2, a critical signal for T-cell proliferation in the cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection.
Results from two multicentre double-blind studies comparing basiliximab with placebo (463 patients in total) show that basiliximab significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes within 6 months after transplantation when used concomitantly with ciclosporin for microemulsion, corticosteroids, and either azathioprine (21% vs.

Other common side effects (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are neutropenia (low white blood cell count), electrolyte imbalance, anorexia (lack of appetite), dizziness, paresthesia (pins and needles), somnolence (sleepiness), vomiting, abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia (indigestion), dry mouth, flatulence (gas), signs of liver damage in the blood, rash, asthenia (weakness), fatigue (tiredness) and pyrexia (fever).
Posaconazole SP should not be used in patients who are taking any of the following drugs: • Ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (used to treat migraine), • Terfenadine, astemizole (used for allergy), • Cisapride (used for stomach problems), • Pimozide (used for treating mental illness), • Quinidine (used for irregular heart beat), • Halofantrine (used to treat malaria), • Simvastatin, lovastatin or atorvastatin (used to lower cholesterol).
The Committee decided that Posaconazole SP’ s benefits are greater than its risks for treatment of invasive aspergillosis, fusariosis, coccidioidomycosis, chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients who cannot tolerate other antifungal drugs or have not improved after at least 7 days of treatment.
It also decided that Posaconazole SP’ s effectiveness had been shown as first-line therapy in oropharyngeal candidiasis and in the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in patients receiving chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease.
Co-administration with the CYP3A4 substrates terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, halofantrine or quinidine since this may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, leading to QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
Posaconazole SP should be administered with caution to patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions such as: • Congenital or acquired QTc prolongation • Cardiomyopathy, especially in the presence of cardiac failure • Sinus bradycardia • Existing symptomatic arrhythmias • Concomitant use with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval (other than those mentioned in section 4.3).
Therefore, inhibitors (e. g. verapamil, ciclosporin, quinidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, etc.) or inducers (e. g. rifampicin, rifabutin, certain anticonvulsants, etc.) of these clearance pathways may increase or decrease posaconazole plasma concentrations, respectively.
The effect of other H2 receptor antagonists (e. g. famotidine, ranitidine) and proton pump inhibitors (e. g. omeprazole) that may suppress gastric acidity for several hours on plasma levels of posaconazole has not been studied but a reduction in bioavailability may occur so that co- administration should be avoided if possible.
Following co-administration of oral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold (range 1.2 to 26- fold), respectively.
Following co-administration of oral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily) with atazanavir and ritonavir (300/ 100 mg once daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects Cmax and AUC of atazanavir increased by an average of 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold (range 0.9 to 4.1-fold), respectively.
In another study in healthy volunteers, repeat dose administration of oral posaconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of IV midazolam (0.4 mg single dose) by an average of 1.3- and 4.6-fold (range 1.7 to 6.4-fold), respectively; Posaconazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days increased the IV midazolam Cmax and AUC by 1.6 and 6.2-fold (range 1.6 to 7.6-fold), respectively.
Aspergillus species (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ustus), Candida species (Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. inconspicua, C. lipolytica, C. norvegensis, C. pseudotropicalis), Coccidioides immitis, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus.
Clinical experience Invasive aspergillosis Oral posaconazole 800 mg/ day in divided doses was evaluated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease refractory to amphotericin B (including liposomal formulations) or itraconazole or in patients who were intolerant of these medicinal products in a non-comparative salvage therapy trial.
Study 1899 was a randomised, evaluator-blinded study of posaconazole oral suspension (200 mg three times a day) versus fluconazole suspension (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole oral solution (200 mg twice a day) in neutropenic patients who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.
Effect of food on oral absorption in healthy volunteers The AUC of posaconazole is about 2.6 times greater when administered with a non-fat meal or nutritional supplement (14 grams fat) and 4 times greater when administered with a high-fat meal (~ 50 grams fat) relative to the fasted state.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations Children (< 18 years) Following administration of 800 mg per day of posaconazole as a divided dose for treatment of invasive fungal infections, mean trough plasma concentrations from 12 patients 8 - 17 years of age (776 ng/ ml) were similar to concentrations from 194 patients 18 - 64 years of age (817 ng/ ml).
Hepatic impairment In a study with small number of subjects (n=12) who had hepatic impairment, there was an increase in exposure associated with prolongation of half-life in hepatic impaired patients (26.6, 35.3, and 46.1 hours for the mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively compared to 22.1 hours in subjects with normal hepatic function).
these medicines, which can lead to very serious disturbances in heart rhythm: • terfenadine (used to treat allergies) • astemizole (used to treat allergies) • cisapride (used to treat stomach problems) • pimozide (used to treat symptoms of Tourette's disorder) • halofantrine (used to treat malaria) • quinidine (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms).
If you are already being treated with rifabutin, your blood counts and some possible side effects to rifabutin will need to be monitored. • Some medicines used to treat or prevent fits, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone. • Efavirenz, which is used to treat HIV infection.
These include: • Vincristine, vinblastine and other vinca alkaloids (used to treat cancer) • Ciclosporin (used in transplant surgery) • Tacrolimus and sirolimus (used in transplant surgery) • Rifabutin (used to treat certain infections) • Medicines used to treat HIV called protease inhibitors (including lopinavir and atazanavir, which are given with ritonavir) and non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) • Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam and some similar medicines called benzodiazepines (used as sedatives or muscle relaxants) • Diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, nisoldipine and some of the other medicines called calcium channel blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) • Digoxin (used to treat heart failure) • Sulfonylureas such as glipizide (used to treat high blood sugar).

Micafungin treatment should be conducted on a careful risk/ benefit basis, particularly in patients having severe liver function impairment or chronic liver diseases known to represent preneoplastic conditions, such as advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, neonatal liver disease or congenital enzyme defects, or receiving a concomitant therapy including hepatotoxic and/ or genotoxic properties.
Drug interaction studies in healthy human subjects were conducted to evaluate the potential for interaction between micafungin and mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, prednisolone, sirolimus, nifedipine, fluconazole, ritonavir, rifampicin, itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B.
At the time of entering the study, the proportion of paediatric patients with neutropenia was several-fold higher than in adult patients (40.2% and 7.3% of children and adults, respectively), as well as allogeneic HSCT (29.4% and 13.4%, respectively) and haematological malignancy (29.1% and 8.7%, respectively).

Mycamine is used in babies, children and adults in the following situations: • to treat invasive candidiasis (a type of fungal infection caused by a yeast-like fungus called Candida). ‘ Invasive ’ means that the fungus has spread into tissue and blood vessels; • to prevent infection with Candida in patients who are having a bone marrow transplant (to treat bone marrow or blood problems, or certain types of cancer) or who are expected to have neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) for 10 days or more.
The most common side effects with Mycamine (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are leucopenia (low levels of leucocytes, a type of white blood cell), neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels), hypomagnesaemia (low blood magnesium levels), hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium levels), headache, phlebitis (inflammation of a vein), nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal (tummy) pain, signs of liver problems in the blood (increased levels of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin), rash, pyrexia (fever) and rigors (shaking chills).
Additional common side effects in children (seen in between 1 and 10 children in 100) are thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension (low blood pressure), hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), acute renal failure (sudden kidney failure) and increased blood urea levels.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Mycamine’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and of oesophageal candidiasis, and for the prophylaxis of Candida infection in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or who are expected to have neutropenia for 10 or more days, but that it should only be used if other antifungals are not appropriate.
• Patients receiving sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole in combination with Mycamine should be monitored for sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole toxicity and the sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole dosage should be reduced if necessary. • Patients should be carefully monitored for liver damage and for worsening of renal function. • To minimise the risk of adaptive regeneration and potentially subsequent liver tumour formation, early discontinuation in the presence of significant and persistent elevation of ALT/ AST is recommended.

Although the clinical trial experience with sodium oxybate in narcolepsy/ cataplexy patients at therapeutic doses does not show clear evidence of a withdrawal syndrome, in rare cases, adverse events such as insomnia, headache, anxiety, dizziness, sleep disorder, somnolence, hallucination, and psychotic disorders were observed after GHB discontinuation.
The effectiveness of sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy symptoms was established in four multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials (Trial 1, 2, 3 and 4) in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy except for trial 2 where cataplexy was not required for enrolment Concomitant stimulant use was permitted in all trials (except for the active-treatment phase of Trial 2); antidepressants were withdrawn prior to active treatment in all trials with the exception of Trial 2.
After a single oral dose of 25 mg/ kg, AUC values were double in cirrhotic patients, with apparent oral clearance reduced from 9.1 in healthy adults to 4.5 and 4.1 ml/ min/ kg in Class A (without ascites) and Class C (with ascites) patients, respectively.
11 Gamma Butyrolactone (GBL), a pro-drug of GHB tested at exposures similar to the expected in man (1.21-1.64 times) has been classified by NTP as non-carcinogenic in rats and equivocal carcinogen in mice, due to slight increase of pheochromocytomas which was difficult to interpret due to high mortality in the high dose group.

In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.
The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti- inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
In preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals.

The most common side effects with Revasc (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are anaemia (low red blood cell counts), nausea (feeling sick), wound secretion (oozing of fluid from wounds), hypotension (low blood pressure), deep thrombophlebitis (inflammation of deep veins that can be caused by a blood clot), fever, injection site mass (lumps at the site of injection), haematomas (collections of blood), oedema (swelling) in legs, and non-fatal allergic reactions.
Desirudin should be used with caution in conditions with increased risks of haemorrhage such as major surgery, biopsy or puncture of a non-compressible vessel within the last month; a history of haemorrhagic stroke, intracranial or intraocular bleeding including diabetic (haemorrhagic) retinopathy; a cerebral ischaemic attack within the last 6 months, a known haemostatic disorder (congenital or acquired, e. g. haemophilia, liver disease) or a history of gastrointestinal or pulmonary bleeding within the past 3 months.
As with other anticoagulants desirudin should be used with caution in conjunction with medicinal products which affect platelet function these medicinal products include: acetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs, ticlopidine and clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa antagonists (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) and iloprost.
The following related adverse reactions were listed below by system organ class and within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness: common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000).
Increase in liver enzymes, dizziness, sleeplessness, confusion, feeling breathless, vomiting (with or without blood), constipation, blood in your urine, difficulty in urinating, rash, itching (urticaria), low levels of potassium in the blood, burning feeling when passing urine with also an increased frequency of urination, slow healing of wounds, nose bleeds, high blood pressure, pain (including pain in legs, stomach and/ or chest).
Efient, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (i. e. unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [UA/ NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
This concern applies especially to patients: • ≥ 75 years of age (see below). • with a propensity to bleed (e. g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, or active peptic ulcer disease) • with body weight < 60 kg (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Although not studied in specific interaction studies, Efient has been co-administered in the phase 3 clinical trial with low molecular weight heparin, bivalirudin, and GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitors (no information available regarding the type of GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitor used) without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
Therefore, CYP3A inhibitors such as azol antifungals, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, verapamil, diltiazem, indinavir, ciprofloxacin, and grapefruit juice are not anticipated to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite.
Safety in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI was evaluated in one clopidogrel- controlled study (TRITON) in which 6741 patients were treated with prasugrel (60 mg loading dose and 10 mg once daily maintenance dose) for a median of 14.5 months (5802 patients were treated for over 6 months, 4136 patients were treated for more than 1 year).
The most common site of spontaneous bleeding was the gastrointestinal tract (1.7% rate with prasugrel and 1.3% rate with clopidogrel); the most frequent site of provoked bleeding was the arterial puncture site (1.3% rate with prasugrel and 1.2% with clopidogrel).
a Centrally adjudicated events defined by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group criteria. b Other standard therapies were used as appropriate. c Any intracranial haemorrhage or any clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in haemoglobin ≥ 5 g/ dL.
In patients ≥ 60 kg and age < 75 years, non-CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding rates were 3.6% for prasugrel and 2.8% for clopidogrel; rates for fatal bleeding were 0.2% for prasugrel and 0.1% for clopidogrel.
For patients who received their thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI major or minor bleeding were 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the prasugrel group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the clopidogrel group.
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Following administration of a 900 mg loading dose of clopidogrel (with ASA), 56 subjects with ACS were treated for 14 days with either prasugrel 10 mg once daily or clopidogrel 150 mg once daily, and then switched to either clopidogrel 150 mg or prasugrel 10 mg for another 14 days.
The benefits associated with prasugrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/ low molecular weight heparin, bivalirudin, intravenous GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitors, lipid-lowering medicinal products, beta-blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
In the All ACS population, prasugrel was associated with a lower incidence of CV death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke compared to clopidogrel, regardless of baseline characteristics such as age, sex, body weight, geographical region, use of GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitors, and stent type.
These included definite or probable stent thrombosis at study end (0.9% vs 1.8%; HR 0.498; CI 0.364, 0.683); CV death, nonfatal MI, or urgent target vessel revascularisation through 30 days (5.9% vs 7.4%; HR 0.784; CI 0.688,0.894); all cause death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke through study end (10.2% vs 12.1%; HR 0.831; CI 0.751, 0.919); CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke or rehospitalisation for cardiac ischaemic event through study end (11.7% vs 13.8%; HR 0.838; CI 0.762, 0.921).
Analysis of all cause death did not show any significant difference between prasugrel and clopidogrel in the All ACS population (2.76% vs 2.90%), in the UA/ NSTEMI population (2.58% vs 2.41%), and in the STEMI population (3.28% vs 4.31%).
Although bleeding was increased with prasugrel, an analysis of the composite endpoint of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and non-CABG-related TIMI major haemorrhage favoured Efient compared to clopidogrel (Hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95; p=0.004).
In healthy subjects, patients with stable atherosclerosis, and patients with ACS receiving Efient, there was no relevant effect of genetic variation in CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 on the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel or its inhibition of platelet aggregation.
Efient, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (i. e. unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [UA/ NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
This concern applies especially to patients: • ≥ 75 years of age (see below). • with a propensity to bleed (e. g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, or active peptic ulcer disease) • with body weight < 60 kg (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Although not studied in specific interaction studies, Efient has been co-administered in the phase 3 clinical trial with low molecular weight heparin, bivalirudin, and GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitors (no information available regarding the type of GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitor used) without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.

M-M-RVAXPRO is very similar to another presentation of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine already authorised (M-M-R II) but with a slight difference: where the existing presentation is manufactured with a protein, albumin, that is extracted from human serum (the liquid part of the blood); M-M-RVAXPRO is manufactured with the same protein, but made using ‘ recombinant DNA technology’ (a technique where a yeast is given a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce human albumin).

Since live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture, persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e. g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions.
Use with other vaccines Published clinical data support concomitant administration of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. with other childhood vaccinations, including DTaP (or DTwP), IPV (or OPV), HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b), HIB-HBV (Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella).
(1) In a 10 year survey involving over 700 pregnant women who received rubella vaccine within 3 months before or after conception (of whom 189 received the Wistar RA 27/ 3 strain), none of the newborns had abnormalities compatible with congenital rubella syndrome; (2) Mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of spontaneous abortion.
Additionally, other adverse experiences reported with post-marketing use of M-M-RVAXPRO and/ or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of previous formulations of monovalent and of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. without regard to causality or frequency are available and are summarised below (frequency not known).

There are no data available to support the efficacy of 4 mg/ kg daily in patients with RIE or cSSTI associated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia whose creatinine clearance is between 30-49 ml/ min or to support the use of 4 mg/ kg every 48 hours in such patients whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/ min.
Creatine phosphokinase and myopathy Increases in plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK; MM isoenzyme) levels associated with muscular pains and/ or weakness and cases of myositis, myoglobinaemia and rhabdomyolysis have been reported during therapy with Cubicin (see also sections 4.5, 4.8 and 5.3).
Therefore, it is recommended that: • Plasma CPK should be measured at baseline and at regular intervals (at least once weekly) during therapy in all patients. • It cannot be ruled out that those patients with CPK greater than 5 times upper limit of normal at baseline may be at increased risk of further increases during daptomycin therapy.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates and ciclosporin). • Cubicin should not be administered to patients who are taking other medications associated with myopathy unless it is considered that the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. • Patients should be reviewed regularly while on therapy for any signs or symptoms that might represent myopathy. • Any patient that develops unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, weakness or cramps should have CPK levels monitored every 2 days.
For subjects who received Cubicin, the adverse reactions that were most frequently reported during therapy plus follow-up were: headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fungal infections, rash, infusion site reaction, increased Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and abnormal liver enzymes; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase.

Cubicin has been studied in two large studies involving 1,118 patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (mainly wound infections and major abscesses) and in one study involving 246 patients with bacteraemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including 35 patients with right-sided infective endocarditis.
The most common side effects with Cubicin (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are infections caused by fungi (moulds and yeasts), headache, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, infusion site reactions, abnormal liver tests and raised levels in the blood of an enzyme called CPK (a marker of muscle damage).
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Cubicin’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of adults with complicated skin and soft-tissue infections and right-sided infectious endocarditis, and with bacteraemia due to Staphylococcus aureus associated with either of these infections.
Refludan is used to prevent blood clotting in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT, a certain type of allergy to heparin which causes a lack of platelets in the blood or clots in the blood vessels) and who have thromboembolic disease (abnormal development of blood clots) that needs injected antithrombotic treatment, usually heparin.

This particularly includes the following situations with increased bleeding risk: – Recent puncture of large vessels or organ biopsy – Anomaly of vessels or organs – Recent cerebrovascular accident, stroke, or intracerebral surgery – Severe uncontrolled hypertension – Bacterial endocarditis – Advanced renal impairment – Haemorrhagic diathesis – Recent major surgery – Recent bleeding (e. g. intracranial, gastrointestinal, intraocular, pulmonary) – Overt signs of bleeding – Recent active peptic ulcer – Age > 65 years.
Treatment initiation with Refludan should be undertaken only in a setting where medical assistance is readily available and where there is access to treatment for anaphylactic reactions. – Patients should be informed that they have received Refludan. – In case of renal impairment relative overdose may occur even under a standard dosage regimen.
Serious liver injury (e. g. liver cirrhosis) may enhance the anticoagulant effect of lepirudin due to coagulation defects secondary to reduced generation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. – Formation of anti-hirudin antibodies was observed in about 40% of HIT type II patients and have been reported especially with a treatment period exceeding five days.
Concomitant use with – antiplatelet agents other than acetylsalicylic acid, such as ticlopidine or clopidogrel, – GpIIb/ IIIa receptor antagonists such as eptifibatide, tirofiban, or abciximab, – other thrombin inhibitors such as low molecular weight heparins has not been assessed.
If life-threatening bleeding occurs and excessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected, the following recommendations should be followed: – Immediately STOP Refludan administration – Determine aPTT and other coagulation parameters as appropriate – Determine haemoglobin and prepare for blood transfusion – Follow the current guidelines for shock-therapy.

CYP2D6 inducers and inhibitors: in a population pharmacokinetic analysis, it has been shown that there was no significant effect on palonosetron clearance when co-administered with CYP2D6 inducers (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and inhibitors (including amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, quinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline or terbinafine).
In two randomised, double-blind studies with a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≤ 50 mg/ m2, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide ≤ 1,500 mg/ m2 and doxorubicin > 25 mg/ m2, palonosetron 250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were compared with ondansetron 32 mg (half-life 4 hours) or dolasetron 100 mg (half-life 7.3 hours) administered intravenously on Day 1, without dexamethasone.
In a randomised, double-blind study with a total of 667 patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≥ 60 mg/ m2, cyclophosphamide > 1,500 mg/ m2 and dacarbazine, palonosetron 250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were compared with ondansetron 32 mg administered intravenously on Day 1.
High doses of palonosetron (each dose causing at least 30 times the human therapeutic exposure) applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice.
• Aloxi is a clear colourless solution for injection into a vein. • The active ingredient (palonosetron) belongs to a group of medicines known as serotonin (5HT3) antagonists. • These have the ability to block the action of the chemical, serotonin, which can cause nausea and vomiting. • Aloxi is used for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.
Other uncommon side effects are: high or low blood pressure abnormal heart rate or lack of blood flow to the heart discolouration or widening of the veins abnormally high or low levels of potassium in the blood high levels of sugar in the blood or sugar in the urine low levels of calcium in the blood high levels of the pigment bilirubin in the blood high levels of certain liver enzymes elevated moods or feelings of anxiousness sleepiness or trouble sleeping decrease or loss of appetite weakness, tiredness, fever or flu like symptoms numbness, burning, prickling or tingling sensations on the skin itchy skin rash impaired vision or eye irritation motion sickness ringing in the ear hiccups, flatulence, dry mouth or indigestion, abdominal (stomach) pain difficulty urinating joint pain electrocardiogram abnormalities (QT prolongation)

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Fuzeon’ s benefits are greater than its risks in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients who have received treatment with and failed on regimens containing at least one medicinal product from each of the following classes, protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or who have intolerance to previous antiretroviral regimens.
Fuzeon is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients who have received treatment with and failed on regimens containing at least one medicinal product from each of the following antiretroviral classes: protease inhibitors, non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or who have intolerance to previous antiretroviral regimens.
In an in-vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone).
In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.
Grade 3= severe pain requiring analgesics (or narcotic analgesics for ≤ 72 hours) and/ or limiting usual activities; Grade 4= severe pain requiring hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, resulting in death, or persistent or significant disability/ incapacity, or life- threatening, or medically significant. c Grade 3= ≥ 50 mm but < 85 mm average diameter; Grade 4= ≥ 85 mm average diameter. d Grade 3= ≥ 25 mm but< 50 mm average diameter; Grade 4= ≥ 50 mm average diameter. e Grade 3= ≥ 3 cm; Grade 4= If draining. f Grade 3= refractory to topical treatment or requiring oral or parenteral treatment; Grade 4= not defined. g Grade 3= > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm; Grade 4= > 5 cm.
The most frequently reported events occurring in the TORO 1 and TORO 2 studies were diarrhoea (38 versus 73 patients with event per 100 patient years for Fuzeon + OB versus OB) and nausea (27 versus 50 patients with event per 100 patient years for Fuzeon + OB versus OB).
The susceptibility to enfuvirtide of 612 HIV recombinants containing the env genes from HIV RNA samples taken at baseline from patients in Phase III studies gave a geometric mean EC 50 of 0.259 μ g/ ml (geometric mean + 2SD = 1.96 μ g/ ml) in a recombinant phenotype HIV entry assay.
Due to its novel viral target enfuvirtide is equally active in vitro against both wild- type laboratory and clinical isolates and those with resistance to 1, 2 or 3 other classes of antiretrovirals (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors).
Fuzeon+OB therapy was associated with a higher proportion of patients reaching < 400 copies/ ml (or < 50 copies/ ml) across all subgroups based on baseline CD4, baseline HIV-1 RNA, number of prior antiretrovirals (ARVs) or number of active ARVs in the OB regimen.
However, subjects with baseline CD4 > 100 cells/ mm3, baseline HIV-1 RNA < 5.0 log10 copies/ ml, ≤ 10 prior ARVs, and/ or other active ARVs in their OB regimen were more likely to achieve a HIV-1 RNA of < 400 copies/ ml (or < 50 copies/ ml) on either treatment.
In 25 paediatric patients ranging in age from 5 to 16 years and receiving the 2 mg/ kg bid dose into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen, the mean steady-state AUC was 54.3 ± 23.5 μ g*h/ ml, Cmax was 6.14 ± 2.48 μ g/ ml, and Ctrough was 2.93 ± 1.55 μ g/ ml.

4 A probable case of toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg/ kg/ d) was reported in an 18-year old anorectic female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalaemia, pancytopaenia, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis.
With haemodialysis, use of alternative waste nitrogen excretion pathways (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), dietary protein restriction, and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation, the survival rate in new-borns diagnosed after birth (but within the first month of life) increased to almost 80% with most deaths occurring during an episode of acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy.
Plasma and urine concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites have been obtained from fasting normal adults who received a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and from patients with urea cycle disorders, haemoglobinopathies and cirrhosis receiving single and repeated oral doses up to 20 g/ day (uncontrolled studies).

Clopidogrel BMS can be started between seven days and six months after the attack; • patients with peripheral arterial disease (problems with blood flow in the arteries); • patients who have a condition known as ‘ acute coronary syndrome ’, when it should be given in combination with aspirin (another anticoagulant), including patients who have had a stent inserted (a short tube placed in an artery to prevent it closing up).
The most common side effects with Clopidogrel BMS (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are haematoma (a collection of blood under the skin), epistaxis (nosebleeds), gastrointestinal haemorrhage (bleeding in the stomach or gut), diarrhoea, abdominal (tummy) pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), bruising and bleeding where the skin is punctured.

In patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: − Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction): clopidogrel treatment should be initiated with a single 300-mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once a day (with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75 mg-325 mg daily).
As with other antiplatelet agents, clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other pathological conditions and in patients receiving treatment with ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including Cox-2 inhibitors.
However, patients entered into clinical trials with clopidogrel received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diuretics, beta blockers, ACEI, calcium antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents (including insulin), antiepileptic agents, and GPIIb/ IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
In CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel + ASA group (17.4%) vs. the placebo + ASA group (12.9%). The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups (1.3% versus 1.1% for the clopidogrel + ASA and the placebo + ASA groups, respectively).
The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been evaluated in 4 double-blind studies involving over 80,000 patients: the CAPRIE study, a comparison of clopidogrel to ASA, and the CURE, CLARITY and COMMIT studies comparing clopidogrel to placebo, both medicinal products given in combination with ASA and other standard therapy.
In a subgroup analysis by qualifying condition (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and PAD) the benefit appeared to be strongest (achieving statistical significance at p = 0.003) in patients enrolled due to PAD (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) (RRR = 23.7%; CI:
8 The number of patients experiencing the primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke] was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p=0.00009) for the clopidogrel-treated group (17% relative risk reduction when patients were treated conservatively, 29% when they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent and 10% when they underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)).
12.8, 46.4), 4% (CI: -26.9, 26.7), 6% (CI: -33.5, 34.3) and 14% (CI: -31.6, 44.2), during the 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, 6-9 and 9-12 month study intervals, respectively.
The number of patients experiencing the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia) was 1,035 (16.5%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 1,187 (18.8%) in the placebo- treated group, a 14% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 6%-21%, p=0.0005) for the clopidogrel- treated group.
In particular, in a post-hoc analysis in 2,172 patients (17% of the total CURE population) who underwent stent placement (Stent-CURE), the data showed that clopidogrel compared to placebo, demonstrated a significant RRR of 26.2% favouring clopidogrel for the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke or refractory ischaemia).
Patients received clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, followed by 75 mg/ day, n=1,752) or placebo (n=1,739), both in combination with ASA (150 to 325 mg as a loading dose, followed by 75 to 162 mg/ day), a fibrinolytic agent and, when appropriate, heparin.
After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day, plasma levels of the main circulating metabolite were lower in subjects with severe renal disease (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 ml/ min) compared to subjects with moderate renal disease (creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 ml/ min) and to levels observed in other studies with healthy subjects.

4 Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease.
QT interval In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.
However, as with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).
Adults The most frequently (seen in ≥ 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, cholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, dizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue and oedema.
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/ l) which increased to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.016 mmol/ l - < 1.467 mmol/ l) to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l).
In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) for serotonin 5 HT2A/ 2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5; α 1 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors.
In a multinational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms (baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p=0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1).
In a second 12 month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p = 0.055).
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence, defined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria.

46 Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease.
QT interval In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.
However, as with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).
Adults The most frequently (seen in ≥ 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, cholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, dizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue and oedema.
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/ l) which increased to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.016 mmol/ l - < 1.467 mmol/ l) to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l).
In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) for serotonin 5 HT2A/ 2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5; α 1 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors.
In a multinational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms (baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p=0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1).

TORISEL should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to temsirolimus, to its metabolites (the substances that it is broken down into) including sirolimus (a medicine used to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys), to polysorbate 80 or to any of the other ingredients of the medicine.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that TORISEL’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have at least three of the following prognostic risk factors: • less than one year from time of initial renal cell carcinoma diagnosis, • Karnofsky score status of less than 70, • haemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, • corrected calcium of greater than 10 mg/ dl, • lactate dehydrogenase over 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, • more than one metastatic organ site.
Hypersensitivity/ infusion reactions Hypersensitivity/ infusion reactions (including some life-threatening and rare fatal reactions), including and not limited to flushing, chest pain, dyspnoea, hypotension, apnoea, loss of consciousness, hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been associated with the administration of temsirolimus (see section 4.8).
At the discretion of the physician, treatment may be resumed after the administration of an H1-receptor antagonist (diphenhydramine or similar antihistamine) and a H2-receptor antagonist (intravenous famotidine 20 mg or intravenous ranitidine 50 mg) approximately 30 minutes before restarting the TORISEL infusion.
Because it is recommended that an H1 antihistamine be administered to patients before the start of the intravenous temsirolimus infusion, temsirolimus should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to the antihistamine or in patients who cannot receive the antihistamine for other medical reasons.
Agents inhibiting CYP3A metabolism Agents such as protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir), antifungals (e. g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole), calcium channel blockers (e. g., diltiazem, verapamil), macrolide antibiotics (e. g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), and cimetidine, grapefruit juice, aprepitant, fluvoxamine and nefazodone are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and may increase blood concentrations of the active moieties, temsirolimus and its metabolite, sirolimus.
Agents inducing CYP3A metabolism Co-administration of TORISEL with rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4/ 5 inducer, had no significant effect on temsirolimus Cmax (maximum concentration) and AUC (area under the concentration vs. time curve) after intravenous administration, but decreased sirolimus Cmax by 65% and AUC by 56%, compared to TORISEL treatment alone.
Agents inhibiting CYP3A metabolism Co-administration of TORISEL 5 mg with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, had no significant effect on temsirolimus Cmax or AUC; however, sirolimus AUC increased 3.1-fold, and AUCsum (temsirolimus + sirolimus) increased 2.3-fold compared to TORISEL alone.
The most serious reactions observed with TORISEL are hypersensitivity/ infusion reactions (including some life-threatening and rare fatal reactions), hyperglycaemia/ glucose intolerance, infections, interstitial lung disease, hyperlipaemia, intracerebral bleeding, renal failure, bowel perforation, and wound healing complication.
The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions (all grades) observed with TORISEL include anaemia, nausea, rash (including rash, pruritic rash, maculopapular rash, pustular rash), anorexia, oedema (including facial oedema and peripheral oedema), and asthenia.
Study 1 Study 1 was a phase 3, multi-centre, three-arm, randomised, open-label study in previously untreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and with 3 or more of 6 pre-selected prognostic risk factors (less than one year from time of initial RCC diagnosis to randomisation, Karnofsky performance status of 60 or 70, haemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium of greater than 10 mg/ dl, lactate dehydrogenase > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, more than one metastatic organ site).
Patients were stratified for prior nephrectomy status within three geographic regions and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive IFN-α alone (n = 207), TORISEL alone (25 mg weekly; n = 209), or the combination of IFN-α and TORISEL (n = 210).
Treatment with the combination of TORISEL and IFN-α resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of certain grade 3-4 adverse events (weight loss, anaemia, neutropaenia, thrombocytopaenia and mucosal inflammation) when compared with the adverse events observed in the IFN-α or TORISEL-alone arms.
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to or even lower than clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use, were as follows: pancreatic islet cell vacuolation (rat), testicular tubular degeneration (mouse, rat and monkey), lymphoid atrophy (mouse, rat and monkey), mixed cell inflammation of the colon/ caecum (monkey), and pulmonary phospholipidosis (rat).
DILUTION OF TORISEL 25 MG/ ML CONCENTRATE WITH THE SUPPLIED DILUENT • Withdraw 1.8 ml of the supplied diluent. • Inject the 1.8 ml of diluent into the vial of TORISEL 25 mg/ ml concentrate which contains 30 mg of temsirolimus (1.2 ml of concentrate). • Mix the diluent and the concentrate well by inversion of the vial.
One vial of 1.2 ml of TORISEL 25 mg/ ml concentrate contains 30 mg of temsirolimus: when the 1.2 ml concentrate is combined with 1.8 ml of withdrawn diluent, a total volume of 3.0 ml is obtained, and the concentration of temsirolimus will be 10 mg/ ml.
ADMINISTRATION OF CONCENTRATE-DILUENT MIXTURE IN SODIUM CHLORIDE INFUSION • Withdraw the required amount of concentrate-diluent mixture (containing temsirolimus 10 mg/ ml) from the vial; i. e., 2.5 ml for a temsirolimus dose of 25 mg. • Inject the withdrawn volume rapidly into 250 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure adequate mixing.

The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements: • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) • That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increased with the subcutaneous (sc) route. • There is insufficient data on Binocrit to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with sc use • Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CKD • The loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
Binocrit is used in the following situations: • to treat anaemia (low red blood cell counts) that is causing symptoms in patients with ‘ chronic renal failure’ (long-term, progressive decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or other kidney problems; • to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusions; • to increase the amount of blood that can be taken in adult patients with moderate anaemia who are going to have an operation and donate their own blood before surgery (autologous blood transfusion); • to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults with mild anaemia who are about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery, such as hip surgery.
It must not be used in the following groups: • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia (reduced or stopped red blood cell production) following treatment with any erythropoietin; • patients with high blood pressure that is not controlled; • patients who are going to donate their own blood who have had a heart attack or stroke within the last month, who have angina pectoris (a severe type of chest pain) or who are at risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT: formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body, usually in the leg); 2/ 3 • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots; • patients about to undergo major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).

If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
124 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), as measured by the following instruments and scales:
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.

Prior to launch and as agreed with competent authorities in the Member States, the MAH shall provide healthcare professionals in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies with the following: • Educational leaflet • Summary of product characteristics (SPC) and Package Leaflet and Labelling • Cool boxes for patients clearly labelled with a visual aid indicating correct use of product.
The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements: • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) • That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increased with the subcutaneous (sc) route. • There is insufficient data on Binocrit to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with subcutaneous use • Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CKD • The loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
Binocrit is used: for treating symptomatic anaemia associated with kidney disease (given by injection into a vein) in children and adults on dialysis in adults on peritoneal dialysis for treating severe symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease in adults not yet undergoing dialysis (given by injection into a vein) for treating anaemia and reducing the need for a blood transfusion in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the doctor in moderately anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it, donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery (autologous predonation) as an alternative to a blood transfusion in adult patients about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery where there is a potentially high risk from blood transfusion complications
This risk should be carefully weighted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e. g. if you are obese or have a history of thrombotic vascular events (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
heart, heart attack, cerebral haemorrhages, stroke, temporary disturbance of blood perfusion in the brain, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, dilatation of the wall of a blood vessel (aneurysm), retinal thrombosis, and blood clot in an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietin treatment.

Angiox is used to treat adults with ‘ acute coronary syndromes’ (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), such as unstable angina (a type of chest pain that varies in severity) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without ‘ ST segment elevation’ (an abnormal reading on the electrocardiogram or ECG).

For the treatment of ACS, the main study involved almost 14,000 patients and compared the effectiveness of Angiox, taken alone or with a glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another type of medicine that helps to prevent blood clots), with the standard treatment combination of heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.
• a known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, or to hirudins • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding because of haemostasis disorders and/ or irreversible coagulation disorders • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis • severe renal impairment (GFR < 30ml/ min) and in dialysis-dependent patients.
The following adverse reaction data are based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in 13,819 patients with ACS; 4612 were randomised to bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin plus GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor.
ACUITY major bleeding defined as any one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, access site haemorrhage requiring radiological or surgical intervention, ≥ 5cm diameter haematoma at puncture site, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥ 4g/ dL without an overt source of bleeding, reduction in haemaglobin concentration of ≥ 3g/ dL with an overt source of bleeding, re-operation for bleeding, use of any blood product transfusion.
Major bleeding was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: intracranial haemorrhage, retroperitoneal haemorrhage, blood loss leading to a transfusion of at least two units of whole blood or packed red blood cells, or bleeding resulting in a haemoglobin drop of more than 3 g/ dl, or a fall in haemoglobin greater than 4 g/ dl (or 12% of haematocrit) with no bleeding site identified.
In vitro studies have also shown that bivalirudin prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) thrombin time (TT) and pro-thrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration- dependent manner and that bivalirudin does not induce a platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia/ Thrombosis Syndrome (HIT/ HITTS).
The ACUITY trial was a prospective, randomised open-label, trial of bivalirudin with or without GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor (Arms B and C respectively) versus unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin with GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor (Arm A) in 13,819 high risk ACS patients.

Such a reaction is rare (occurring in fewer than 1 in every 1,000 patients treated). • Extra care will be taken if you are having radiation treatment in the vessels that supply blood to the heart (treatment called beta or gamma brachytherapy). • The dose given depends on your weight and on the kind of treatment you are being given.
2 During situations when commercially manufactured Tamiflu oral suspension is not readily available, adults, adolescents or children who are unable to swallow capsules may receive appropriate doses of Tamiflu (see section 3 in Package Leaflet) by opening capsules and pouring the contents of capsules into a suitable, small amount (1 teaspoon maximum) of sweetened food product such as regular or sugar-free chocolate syrup, honey (only for children two years or older), light brown or table sugar dissolved in water, dessert toppings, sweetened condensed milk, apple sauce or yogurt to mask the bitter taste.
Very Common (≥ 1/ 10), Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), Very rare (< 1/ 10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
In patients with influenza who were receiving Tamiflu, there have been postmarketing reports of convulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of consciousness, confusion, abnormal behaviour, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, nightmares), in a very few cases resulting in accidental injury or fatal outcomes.
In a pooled analysis of all influenza-positive adults and adolescents (N = 2413) enrolled into treatment studies, oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced the median duration of influenza illness by approximately one day from 5.2 days (95% CI 4.9 – 5.5 days) in the placebo group to 4.2 days (95% CI 4.0 – 4.4 days; p ≤ 0.0001).
Oseltamivir treatment, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, significantly reduced the time to freedom from illness (defined as the simultaneous return to normal health and activity and alleviation of fever, cough and coryza) by 1.5 days (95% CI 0.6 – 2.2 days; p < 0.0001) compared to placebo.
Oseltamivir reduced the time to alleviation of all symptoms by 0.7 days (95% CI 0.1 – 1.6 days; p = 0.022) and the duration of fever (≥ 37.8 °C), cough and coryza by one day (95% CI 0.4 – 1.7 days; p < 0.001) compared to placebo.
In the total population, there was a reduction in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in households from 20% (27/ 136) in the group not receiving prevention to 7% (10/ 135) in the group receiving prevention (62.7% reduction [95% CI 26.0 – 81.2; p = 0.0042]).
According to subgroup analysis in children at 1 to 12 years of age, the incidence of laboratory- confirmed clinical influenza among children was significantly reduced from 19% (21/ 111) in the group not receiving prevention to 7% (7/ 104) in the group receiving prevention (64.4% reduction [95% CI 15.8 – 85.0; p = 0.0188]).
Among children who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was reduced from 21% (15/ 70) in the group not receiving prevention to 4% (2/ 47) in the group receiving prevention (80.1% reduction [95% CI 22.0 – 94.9; p = 0.0206]).
A study in elderly residents of nursing homes, where 80% of participants received vaccine in the season of the study, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 12/ 272 (4.4%) in the placebo group to 1/ 276 (0.4%) in the oseltamivir group (92% reduction [95% CI 1.5 – 6.6; p = 0.0015]).

In a pooled analysis of two other studies conducted in unvaccinated otherwise healthy adults, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 25/ 519 (4.8%) in the placebo group to 6/ 520 (1.2%) in the oseltamivir group (76% reduction [95% CI 1.6 – 5.7; p = 0.0006]) during a community outbreak of influenza.
A study in elderly residents of nursing homes, where 80% of participants received vaccine in the season of the study, oseltamivir 75 mg once daily given for 6 weeks significantly reduced the incidence of clinical influenza illness from 12/ 272 (4.4%) in the placebo group to 1/ 276 (0.4%) in the oseltamivir group (92% reduction [95% CI 1.5 – 6.6; p = 0.0015]).

Tamiflu is used to treat or prevent influenza (‘ flu’) in adults and children over the age of one year: • in the treatment of flu, it can be used in patients who have the symptoms of flu, when the influenza virus is known to be circulating in the community. • in the prevention of flu, it can be used in patients who have been in contact with someone who has flu.
4 Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease.
QT interval In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.
However, as with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).
Adults The most frequently (seen in ≥ 1% of patients) reported adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in clinical trials were somnolence, weight gain, eosinophilia, elevated prolactin, cholesterol, glucose and triglyceride levels (see section 4.4), glucosuria, increased appetite, dizziness, akathisia, parkinsonism (see section 4.4), dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, transient asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (see section 4.4), rash, asthenia, fatigue and oedema.
10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/ l) which increased to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.016 mmol/ l - < 1.467 mmol/ l) to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l).
In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) for serotonin 5 HT2A/ 2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5; α adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors.
In a multinationational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms (baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p=0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1).
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p = 0.055).
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence, defined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria.
18 Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease.

10 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline (< 1.016 mmol/ l) which increased to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l) and changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline (≥ 1.016 mmol/ l - < 1.467 mmol/ l) to high (≥ 1.467 mmol/ l).
In preclinical studies, olanzapine exhibited a range of receptor affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) for serotonin 5 HT2A/ 2C, 5 HT3, 5 HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors m1-m5; α adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors.
109 In a multinationational, double-blind, comparative study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and related disorders which included 1,481 patients with varying degrees of associated depressive symptoms (baseline mean of 16.6 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a prospective secondary analysis of baseline to endpoint mood score change demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p=0.001) favouring olanzapine (-6.0) versus haloperidol (-3.1).
In a second 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission with a combination of olanzapine and lithium and were then randomised to olanzapine or lithium alone, olanzapine was statistically non-inferior to lithium on the primary endpoint of bipolar recurrence (olanzapine 30.0%, lithium 38.3%; p = 0.055).
In an 18-month co-therapy study in manic or mixed episode patients stabilised with olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate), long-term olanzapine co-therapy with lithium or valproate was not statistically significantly superior to lithium or valproate alone in delaying bipolar recurrence, defined according to syndromic (diagnostic) criteria.
Neutropenia Caution should be exercised in patients with low leukocyte and/ or neutrophil counts for any reason, in patients receiving medicines known to cause neutropenia, in patients with a history of drug-induced bone marrow depression/ toxicity, in patients with bone marrow depression caused by concomitant illness, radiation therapy or chemotherapy and in patients with hypereosinophilic conditions or with myeloproliferative disease.
QT interval In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapine, with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.
However, as with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when olanzapine is prescribed with medicines known to increase QTc interval, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.
Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabolism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), warfarin (CYP2C9), theophylline (CYP1A2) or diazepam (CYP3A4 and 2C19).

Therefore, the CHMP decided that Nplate’ s benefits are greater than its risks for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura splenectomised patients who are refractory to other treatments, and that it may be considered as second-line treatment for adult non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contra-indicated.
It is used to treat the following infections in adults: • nosocomial pneumonia (an infection of the lungs). ‘ Nosocomial ’ means that the infection was caught in hospital, including pneumonia caused by the use of a ventilator (a machine that helps a patient to breathe); • complicated infections in the abdomen (tummy). ‘ Complicated ’ means that the infection is difficult to treat; • complicated infections of the urinary tract (the structures that carry urine).
Doribax has been studied in five main studies that compared Doribax with other antibiotics: • two studies compared Doribax with piperacillin/ tazobactam or imipenem in a total of 979 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; • two studies compared Doribax with meropenem in a total of 962 patients with complicated infections in the abdomen; • one study compared Doribax with levofloxacin in 753 patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
Doribax was as effective as the other antibiotics in treating the infections: • looking at the results of the two studies in nosocomial pneumonia taken together, 75% of the patients receiving Doribax were cured (195 out of 260), compared with 72% of the patients taking piperacillin/ tazobactam or imipenem (174 out of 241); • looking at the results of the two studies of complicated abdominal infections taken together, 85% of the patients receiving Doribax were cured (275 out of 325), compared with 84% of the patients receiving meropenem (260 out of 309); • in complicated urinary tract infections, 82% of the patients receiving Doribax were cured (230 out of 280), compared with 83% of the patients receiving levofloxacin (221 out of 265).
Hypersensitivity to the active substance Hypersensitivity to any other carbapenem antibacterial agent Severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of beta-lactam antibacterial agent (e.g. penicillins or cephalosporins).
5 Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship Similar to other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the time that the plasma concentration of doripenem exceeds the MIC (%T > MIC) of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in pre-clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies.
In seriously ill patients or those with an impaired immune response, a 4-hour infusion time may be more suitable when the MIC of doripenem for the known or suspected pathogen(s) has been shown or is expected to be > 0.5 mg/l, in order to reach a target attainment of 50% T > MIC in at least 95% of the patients (see section 4.2).

The most common side effects with ECALTA (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are coagulopathy (problems with blood clotting), convulsion (fits), headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), increased blood creatinine levels (a marker of kidney problems), rash, pruritus (itching), hypokalaemia (low levels of potassium in the blood), flushing, and raised blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin and gamma- glutamyltransferase (markers of liver problems).
Other treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 1% of patients in the pivotal study included hypokalemia (3.1%), diarrhoea (3.1%), ALT increased (2.3%), hepatic enzyme increased (1.5%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (1.5%), and blood bilirubin increased (1.5%).
Experimental infections included disseminated C. albicans infection in neutropenic rabbits, oesophageal/ oropharyngeal infection of neutropenic rabbits with fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and disseminated infection of neutropenic mice with fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata.
Patients were randomised to receive either anidulafungin (200 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 100 mg intravenous daily) or fluconazole (800 mg intravenous loading dose followed by 400 mg intravenous daily), and were stratified by APACHE II score (≤ 20 and > 20) and the presence or absence of neutropenia.
The most frequent species isolated at baseline were C. albicans (63.8% anidulafungin, 59.3% fluconazole), followed by C. glabrata (15.7%, 25.4%), C. parapsilosis (10.2%, 13.6%) and C. tropicalis (11.8%, 9.3%) - with 20, 13 and 15 isolates of the last 3 species, respectively, in the anidulafungin group.
Elderly The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that median clearance differed slightly between the elderly group (patients ≥ 65, median CL = 1.07 l/ h) and the non-elderly group (patients < 65, median CL = 1.22 l/ h), however the range of clearance was similar.
Dilution and infusion Aseptically transfer the contents of the reconstituted vial(s) into an intravenous bag (or bottle) containing either 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) sodium chloride for infusion or 50 mg/ ml (5%) glucose for infusion obtaining an anidulafungin concentration of 0.36 mg/ ml.

Puregon is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations: • Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate. • Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to induce the development of multiple follicles in medically assisted reproduction programs [e. g. in vitro fertilisation/ embryo transfer (IVF/ ET), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)].
When ultrasonographic evaluation indicates the presence of at least three follicles of 16- 20 mm, and there is evidence of a good oestradiol response (plasma levels of about 300-400 picograms/ ml (1000-1300 pmol/ l) for each follicle with a diameter greater than 18 mm), the final phase of maturation of the follicles is induced by administration of hCG.
3 • Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. • Tumours of the ovary, breast, uterus, testis, pituitary or hypothalamus. • Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. • Primary ovarian failure. • Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries, not related to polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). • Malformations of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy. • Fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy. • Primary testicular failure.

The active substances of Procomvax consist of polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) purified from Haemophilus influenzae and chemically coupled to the outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) of Neisseria meningitidis, and the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of the hepatitis B virus, derived from a recombinant strain of yeast.
These non- infectious substances protect infants against invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (infection of brain and spinal cord tissues, infection of the blood, etc.) and against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus, by stimulating an immune response (immunogenic activity) against these infections.
Issues pertaining to the relatively low immunogenicity of the Hepatitis B (HepB) component contained in the vaccines containing the recombinant Hepatitis B component from, SPMSD have been assessed and extensively discussed by the CHMP and its Working Parties (Biotechnology Working Party, Vaccines Working Party).
Following the suspension of Hexavac due to reduced immunogenicity of the Hep B component in the vaccine, the MAH (Sanofi Pasteur MSD) was requested in September 2005 to provide further data and clarification on long-term immunological memory and protection against Hep B viral infection afforded by HBVAXPRO and PROCOMVAX, and the timelines of availability of further data.
Although in some of the trials conducted in the past 5 years, the GMTs of the hepatitis B vaccines were lower than responses observed in the early 1990’ s, the clinical data generated by the sponsor in the trials described above, demonstrate consistent, high anti-HBs seroprotective rates, which is the established correlate of effectiveness.
The most recent immunogenicity data comes from the interim analysis of the V232-054 trial, this is the third trial in the past few years to study the current product (from the BTMC manufacturing facility) in young adults using the same dosing schedule (the other two trials are V501-011 and V232- 052).
In addition to the immunogenicity data generated in the past 5 years from clinical trials with the PROCOMVAX data, the acceptable performance of these vaccines are supported from findings of surveillance for hepatitis B cases in the United States and New Zealand and from an analysis of the trend in vaccine failures reported to the MAH safety database.
The CHMP agreed with the MAH that in 4 years time, in the absence of ongoing clinical studies of immunogenicity with the MAH’ s hepatitis B antigen, the MAH will conduct a study of vaccine immunogenicity no less frequently than every four years to confirm that experience with manufactured product remains current and that clinical performance meets expectations.
Considering all points raised, including time lines required to fully explore all issues related to low HepB immunogenicity following vaccination with PROCOMVAX and, further to the assessment of the data provided by the MAH, the CHMP concluded that the MA of PROCOMVAX should be varied in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/ 2004.
• The CHMP identified that the decreased immunogeniticy of the HepB component released by the MAH seems to be due to variability in the production process for this component and that following extensive review of the manufacturing process the MAH has identified the current adjuvantation process as a potential root cause for decreased immunogenicity of the HepB vaccine component.
1 Polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) from Haemophilus influenzae type b as PRP-OMPC -7.5 µg Neisseria meningitidis OMPC (outer membrane protein complex of the B11 strain of Neisseria meningitidis subgroup B) Adsorbed hepatitis B surface antigen produced in recombinant yeast cells(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) - 5.0 µg
Immunogenicity results from open-labeled studies indicate that PROCOMVAX can be administered concomitantly with DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and whole cell Pertussis vaccine), OPV (Oral Poliomyelitis vaccine), IPV (inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine) and Merck MMR (Measles, Mumps,
The remaining 1,816 infants were involved in trials where PROCOMVAX was administered concomitantly with either an investigational pneumococcal polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine or an investigational preparation of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated poliovirus vaccine and were under surveillance for serious adverse experiences.
In one of these trials, a randomized, multicenter study, 882 infants were assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either PROCOMVAX or Merck Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) (Merck PRP-OMPC Vaccine) plus Merck Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of age, with the children monitored daily for five days after each injection for local reactions and systemic complaints.
The following local reactions and systemic complaints were reported in ≥ 1.0% of children within five days after any injection of PROCOMVAX: pain/ soreness, erythema, swelling/ induration at the injection site; fever (> 38.3 °C, rectal equivalent); anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea; irritability, somnolence, crying including unusual high-pitched crying, prolonged crying (> 4hrs), and crying not otherwise specified; otitis media.
At 12 to 15 months of age, PROCOMVAX may be given simultaneously with Merck MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), or OPV or with a booster dose of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) at 15 months of age in children who received the primary series of DTP.

When repaglinide was given 24 hours after the last rifampicin dose, an 80% reduction of the repaglinide AUC was observed (effect of induction alone). Concomitant use of rifampicin and repaglinide might therefore induce a need for repaglinide dose adjustment which should be based on carefully monitored blood glucose concentrations at both initiation of rifampicin treatment (acute inhibition), following dosing (mixed inhibition and induction), withdrawal (induction alone) and up to approximately two weeks after withdrawal of rifampicin where the inductive effect of rifampicin is no longer present.
In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of 250 mg clarithromycin, a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, slightly increased the repaglinide (AUC) by 1.4-fold and Cmax by 1.7-fold and increased the mean incremental AUC of serum insulin by 1.5-fold and the maximum concentration by 1.6-fold.
The AUC (SD) after 2 mg single dose exposure (4 mg in patients with hepatic insufficiency) was 31.4 ng/ ml x hr (28.3) in healthy volunteers, 304.9 ng/ ml x hr (228.0) in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and 117.9 ng/ ml x hr (83.8) in the elderly type 2 diabetic patients.

Switching from capsules or oral solution to transdermal patches Based on comparable exposure between oral and transdermal rivastigmine (see section 5.2), patients 57 treated with Exelon capsules or oral solution can be switched to Exelon transdermal patches as follows: • A patient on a dose of 3 mg/ day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches. • A patient on a dose of 6 mg/ day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches. • A patient on a stable and well tolerated dose of 9 mg/ day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 9.5 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches.
If the oral dose of 9 mg/ day has not been stable and well tolerated, a switch to 4.6 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches is recommended. • A patient on a dose of 12 mg/ day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 9.5 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches.
58 Care must be taken when prescribing Exelon transdermal patches: • to patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8) • to patients with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions because rivastigmine may cause increased gastric secretions (see section 4.8) • to patients predisposed to urinary obstruction and seizures because cholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate these diseases. • to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.
Concomitant administration of rivastigmine with commonly prescribed medicinal products, such as antacids, antiemetics, antidiabetics, centrally acting antihypertensives, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, inotropic agents, antianginals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, oestrogens, analgesics, benzodiazepines and antihistamines, was not associated with an alteration in the kinetics of rivastigmine or an increased risk of clinically relevant untoward effects.
The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) in patients treated with Exelon 9.5 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches was lower than the rate in patients who received 3 to 12 mg/ day Exelon capsule treatment (50.5% with Exelon 9.5 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches vs 63.3% with Exelon capsules; 46.0% of patients on placebo reported AEs).
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea and vomiting, were the most common adverse reactions in patients who received active treatment, and occurred at a substantially lower rate in the Exelon 9.5 mg/ 24 h transdermal patch group compared to the Exelon capsule group (7.2% vs 23.1% for nausea and 6.2% vs 17.0% for vomiting; 5.0% and 3.3% of patients on placebo reported nausea and vomiting, respectively).
Table 1 displays the adverse reactions (events reasonably believed to be causally related to the medicinal product) reported in 291 patients with Alzheimer’ s dementia treated in a specific 24-week double-blind, placebo and active-controlled clinical study with Exelon transdermal patches at target dose of 9.5 mg/ 24 h (4.6 mg/ 24 h titrated to 9.5 mg/ 24 h).
Dizziness (very common); agitation, somnolence, malaise, tremor, confusion, sweating increased (common); insomnia, accidental fall, elevated liver function tests (uncommon); seizures, duodenal ulcers, angina pectoris (rare); cardiac arrhythmia (e. g. atrio-ventricular block, atrial fibrillation and tachycardia), hypertension, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hallucination (very rare); and some cases of severe vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture (unknown).
In a 24-week double-blind study, the most commonly observed symptoms (skin irritation rating scale) with Exelon 9.5 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches were very slight (21.8%), mild (12.5%) or moderate (6.5%) erythema or very slight (11.9%), mild (7.3%) or moderate (5.0%) pruritus.
Treatment As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 3.4 hours and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose all Exelon transdermal patches should be removed immediately and no further transdermal patch should be applied for the next 24 hours.
These include the ADAS-Cog (a performance-based measure of cognition) and the ADCS-CGIC (a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating caregiver input), and the ADCS-ADL (a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities related to finances).
With multiple dosing (such as at steady state), after the previous transdermal patch is replaced with a new one, plasma concentrations initially decrease slowly for about 40 minutes on average, until absorption from the newly applied transdermal patch becomes faster than elimination, and plasma levels begin to rise again to reach a new peak at approximately 8 hours.
The fluctuation index (FI), a measure of the relative difference between peak and trough concentrations((Cmax-Cmin)/ Cavg), was 0.58 for Exelon 4.6 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches and 0.77 for Exelon 9.5 mg/ 24 h transdermal patches, thus demonstrating a much smaller fluctuation between trough and peak concentrations than for the oral formulation (FI = 3.96 (6 mg/ day) and 4.15 (12 mg/ day)).
Total plasma clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 litres/ h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 70 litres/ h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose, which is consistent with the non-linear, over-proportional pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine due to saturation of its elimination.

How to start treatment Your doctor will tell you which Exelon transdermal patch is most suitable for you. • Treatment usually starts with Exelon 4.6 mg/ 24 h. • The usual daily dose is Exelon 9.5 mg/ 24 h. • Only one transdermal patch should be worn at a time and the transdermal patch should be replaced by a new one after 24 hours.
The other common side effects are: diarrhoea, heartburn, stomach pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, urinary tract infection, headache, weakness, tiredness, anxiety, depression, fainting, rashes, skin reactions at the application site (redness, itching, irritation, swelling), severe confusion and fever.
Very rare (less than 1 in 10,000 patients): irregular heart rate (e. g. fast heart rate), high blood pressure, inflammation of the pancreas (severe upper stomach pain, often with nausea and vomiting), gastrointestinal haemorrhage (blood in stools or when vomiting), hallucinations.
The most common side effects with Bondenza tablets (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), diarrhoea, abdominal pain (stomach ache), dyspepsia (indigestion), nausea (feeling sick), influenza-like illness, fatigue (tiredness), musculoskeletal pain (pain in the muscles and bones), arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain) and musculoskeletal stiffness.
Physicians should be alert to signs or symptoms signalling a possible oesophageal reaction during therapy, and patients should be instructed to discontinue Bondenza and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as new or worsening dysphagia, pain on swallowing, retrosternal pain, or heartburn.
In a two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM 16549), the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in patients concomitantly taking aspirin or NSAIDs was similar in patients taking ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily or 150 mg once monthly after one and two years.
In a Phase 1 bioequivalence study conducted in 72 postmenopausal women receiving 150 mg orally every 28 days for a total of four doses, inhibition in serum CTX following the first dose was seen as early as 24 hours post-dose (median inhibition 28%), with median maximal inhibition (69%) seen 6 days later.
8 Bone mineral density (BMD) Bondenza 150 mg once monthly was shown to be at least as effective as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily at increasing BMD in a two year, double-blind, multicentre study (BM 16549) of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (lumbar spine BMD T score below -2.5 SD at baseline).
When a more stringent criterion is considered, which combines both lumbar spine and total hip BMD, 83.9% (p < 0.001) and 65.7% of patients receiving Bondenza 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily, respectively, were responders at one year.
The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, who had a BMD at lumbar spine of 2 to 5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one vertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures.
In the overall patient population of the study MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-vertebral fractures, however daily ibandronate appeared to be effective in a high-risk subpopulation (femoral neck BMD T-score < -3.0), where a non-vertebral fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed.
Bondenza injection is not recommended for use in patients who have a serum creatinine above 200 μ mol/ l (2.3 mg/ dl) or who have a creatinine clearance (measured or estimated) below 30 ml/ min, because of limited clinical data available from studies including such patients (see section 4.4 and section 5.2)
Table 1 and table 2 list adverse events after one year and two years of treatment, respectively, from the pivotal phase III trial BM16550, reported as possibly or probably related to trial medicinal product, in more than 1% of the patients treated with either intravenous injection of Bondenza 3 mg every 3 months or intravenous injection of placebo plus oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
Common adverse reactions (> 1/ 100, ≤ 1/ 10) in the phase III osteoporosis study BM16550 after two years of treatment (cumulative data) and in the phase III anti-fracture study MF 4411 (three- year study), that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study medicinal product.

The histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of postmenopausal women with doses of oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily and intermittent intravenous doses of up to 1 mg every 3 months showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralisation defect.
Bondenza 3 mg intravenous injection, administered every 3 months, was shown to be at least as effective as oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in a 2-year, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non- inferiority study (BM16550) of postmenopausal women (1386 women aged 55 - 80) with osteoporosis (lumbar spine BMD T-score below -2.5 SD at baseline).
The primary analysis of data from study BM16550 at one year and the confirmatory analysis at 2 years demonstrated the non-inferiority of 3 mg every 3 months injection dosing regimen compared to 2.5 mg oral daily dosing regimen, in terms of mean increases in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and trochanter (Table 3).
The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, who had a BMD at the lumbar spine of -2 to -5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one vertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures.
In the overall patient population of the study MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-vertebral fractures, however daily ibandronate appeared to be effective in a high-risk subpopulation (femoral neck BMD T-score < -3.0), where a non-vertebral fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed.
Considering the safety profile of Bondenza and the large number of patients currently enrolled in clinical and post marketing studies for the product as well as the ongoing post-marketing obligations and the continued reports of adverse events received by the MAH, the safety profile will continue to be monitored closely and updates should be provided regularly to the CHMP through 1-yearly PSURs.
Riluzole should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of abnormal liver function, or in patients with slightly elevated serum transaminases (ALT/ SGPT; AST/ SGOT up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN)), bilirubin and/ or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels.
Inhibitors of CYP 1A2 (e. g. caffeine, diclofenac, diazepam, nicergoline, clomipramine, imipramine, fluvoxamine, phenacetin, theophylline, amitriptyline and quinolones) could potentially decrease the rate of riluzole elimination, while inducers of CYP 1A2 (e. g. cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, rifampicin and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination.
Undesirable effects ranked under headings of frequency are listed below, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Race: a clinical study conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of riluzole and its metabolite N- hydroxyriluzole following repeated oral administration twice daily for 8 days in 16 healthy Japanese and 16 Caucasian adult males showed in the Japanese group a lower exposure of riluzole (Cmax 0.85 [90% CI 0.68-1.08] and AUC inf.

It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as an oral solution (1 mg/ ml) and as a solution for injection (7.5 mg/ ml).
Abilify is used to treat adults with the following mental illnesses: • schizophrenia, a mental illness with a number of symptoms, including disorganised thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), suspiciousness and delusions (mistaken beliefs); • bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormally high mood), alternating with periods of normal mood.
The most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or jerking), akathisia (constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), somnolence (sleepiness), sedation (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary hypersecretion (increased production of saliva), fatigue (tiredness), restlessness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and anxiety.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Abilify’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
9 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.

Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
62 Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).

MabThera should not be administered to patients with an active and/ or severe infection (e. g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely immunocompromised patients (e. g. in hypogammaglobulinemia or where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low).
Other symptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/ rash, fatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumor lysis syndrome.
13 grade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia and atrial flutter/ fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the CHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%).
15 Infusion-related reactions Symptoms suggesting an acute infusion reaction (e. g. pruritis, fever, urticaria/ rash, chills, pyrexia, rigors, sneezing, angioneurotic edema, throat irritation, cough and bronchospasm, with or without associated hypotension or hypertension) were observed in 79/ 540 (15%) patients following their first exposure to MabThera; In a study comparing the effect of glucocorticoid regimen, these events were observed in 5/ 149 (3%) of patients following their first rituximab placebo infusion and 42/ 192 (22%) of patients receiving their first infusion of 1000 mg rituximab.
Initial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses In pooled data from three studies, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single lesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/ m2 of MabThera as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses.
Re-treatment, weekly for 4 doses In a multi-centre, single-arm study, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular B cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of MabThera, were re- treated with 375 mg/ m2 of MabThera as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses.
Initial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy In an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/ m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/ m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/ m2/ day on days 1 -5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or MabThera 375 mg/ m2 in combination with CVP (R-CVP).
Maintenance therapy In a prospective, open label, international, multi-centre, phase III trial, 465 patients with relapsed/ refractory follicular NHL were randomised in a first step to induction therapy with either CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone; n=231) or MabThera plus CHOP (R-CHOP, n=234).
Maintenance treatment with MabThera led to a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, PFS, (time from maintenance randomisation to relapse, disease progression or death) when compared to observation alone (p < 0.0001 log-rank test). The median PFS was 42.2 months in the MabThera maintenance arm compared to 14.3 months in the observation arm.
In a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 years) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/ m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/ m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/ m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/ m2/ day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or MabThera 375 mg/ m2 plus CHOP (R-CHOP).
In all patients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β 2 microglobulin, LDH, albumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk ratios for event-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than 0.83 and 0.95 respectively.
In an open-label randomized trial, a total of 817 previously untreated patients with CLL were randomized to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/ m2, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/ m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or MabThera in combination with FC (R-FC).
Eligible patients had active rheumatoid arthritis for at least 6 months, diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), with swollen joint count (SJC) (8 (66 joint count), and tender joint count (TJC) (8 (68 joint count) and elevated CRP or ESR.
Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled, 3 x 3 multifactorial study which compared two different dose levels of rituximab given with or without one of two peri infusional corticosteroid regimens in combination with weekly methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis which had not responded to treatment with 1 to 5 other DMARDs.
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or multiple infusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied rituximab doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/ m2), the typical population estimates of nonspecific clearance (CL1), specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumor burden, and central compartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/ day, 0.59 L/ day, and 2.7 L, respectively.
Rituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/ m2 at weekly intervals for 4 doses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth infusion of 486 µg/ mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/ mL).
25 Upon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/ m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly intervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive infusion, spanning from a mean of 243 µg/ mL (range, 16 – 582 µg/ mL) after the first infusion to 550 µg/ mL (range, 171 – 1177 µg/ mL) after the eighth infusion.
Following two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean terminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/ day (range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/ day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 L).
Following the intravenous administration of 500 and 1000 mg doses of rituximab on two occasions, two weeks apart, mean Cmax values were 183 μ g/ mL (range, 81.8 to 279 μ g/ mL) and 370 μ g/ mL (212 to 637 μ g/ mL), and mean half-lives were 17.9 days (range, 12.3 to 31.3 days) and 19.7 days (range, 12.3 to 34.6 days), respectively.
MabThera should not be administered to patients with an active and/ or severe infection (e. g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely immunocompromised patients (e. g. in hypogammaglobulinemia or where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low).

MabThera is used in adults to treat two types of non-Hodgkin’ s lymphoma (a cancer of the lymph tissue), both of which affect a type of white blood cell called B-lymphocytes: • In follicular lymphoma, MabThera is used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced disease who have not been treated before.
It is also used on its own in patients with advanced disease who are resistant to other anticancer medicines (chemotherapy) or who have failed two or more chemotherapy treatments. • In patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, MabThera is used in combination with a specific type of chemotherapy called ‘ CHOP’ (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone).
In the studies of MabThera monotherapy, 48% of the patients who had failed previous treatment responded to MabThera, and the maintenance study showed that it took 42.2 months for patients who received MabThera to experience a progression of their disease, compared with 14.3 months in patients who did not receive the medicine.
When used to treat non-Hodgkin’ s lymphoma, the most common side effects with MabThera (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are bacterial infections, viral infections, bronchitis (inflammation of the airways in the lungs), neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), leucopenia (low levels of leucocytes, another type of white blood cell), febrile neutropenia (neutropenia with fever), reactions related to the infusion (mainly fever, chills and shivering), angioedema (swelling beneath the skin), nausea (feeling sick), pruritus (itching), rash, alopecia (hair loss), fever, chills, asthenia (weakness), headache and decreased levels of IgG (a type of antibody).

It is used with diet and exercise: • in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin (an antidiabetes medicine) alone; • in patients who are already taking a combination of sitagliptin and metformin as separate tablets; • in combination with a sulphonylurea (another type of antidiabetes medicine) when the combination of a sulphonylurea and metformin is not sufficient to give satisfactory control of the patient’ s diabetes.
It should also not be used in patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones and acids in the blood), diabetic pre-coma, problems with their kidneys or liver, conditions that may affect the kidneys, or a disease that causes a reduced supply of oxygen to the tissues such as failure of the heart or lungs or a recent heart attack.
For patients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy For patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Velmetia should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken.
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with the maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea The dose of Velmetia should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken.
In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
Sitagliptin and metformin Adverse reactions considered as drug related reported in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of placebo and in patients receiving sitagliptin in combination with metformin in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency (Table 1).
1 In this placebo-controlled 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to treatment with placebo added to ongoing metformin was 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
In an additional 1-year study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to sulphonylurea added to ongoing metformin was 14.5% and 30.3%, respectively.
In pooled studies of up to 1 year in duration comparing sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin to a sulphonylurea agent added to ongoing metformin, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulphonylurea agent are as follows: anorexia (Metabolism and nutritional disorders; frequency uncommon) and weight decreased (Investigations; frequency uncommon).
In a 24-week study of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin administered twice daily (sitagliptin/ metformin 50 mg/ 500 mg or 50 mg/ 1,000 mg), the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with placebo was 14.0% and 9.7%, respectively.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0% each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7%), with the differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
Additional information on the individual active substances of the fixed dose combination Sitagliptin In addition, in monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks in duration of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily alone compared to placebo, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness.
During post-marketing experience of Velmetia or sitagliptin, one of the active substances of Velmetia, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported (frequency not known): hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (see section 4.4).
Velmetia combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: sitagliptin phosphate, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
Sitagliptin differs in chemical structure and pharmacological action from GLP-1 analogues, insulin, sulphonylureas or meglitinides, biguanides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR γ) agonists, alpha- glucosidase inhibitors, and amylin analogues.
Overall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used in combination with metformin (as initial or add-on therapy) and in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, as measured by clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint (see Table 3).
Studies of sitagliptin in combination with metformin In a 24-week, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily to ongoing metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared with placebo.
In a 52-week study, comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide (a sulphonylurea agent) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, sitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c (-0.7% mean change from baselines at week 52, with baseline HbA1c of approximately 7.5% in both groups).
group (29.8 events/ 1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups (40.1 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034
Sitagliptin Absorption Following oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 μ M• hr, Cmax was 950 nM.
The study included patients with renal insufficiency classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (50 to < 80 ml/ min), moderate (30 to < 50 ml/ min), and severe (< 30 ml/ min), as well as patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis.
For patients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy For patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Velmetia should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken.
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with the maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea The dose of Velmetia should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken.
In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
Sitagliptin and metformin Adverse reactions considered as drug related reported in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of placebo and in patients receiving sitagliptin in combination with metformin in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency (Table 1).
1 In this placebo-controlled 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to treatment with placebo added to ongoing metformin was 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
In an additional 1-year study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to sulphonylurea added to ongoing metformin was 14.5% and 30.3%, respectively.
In pooled studies of up to 1 year in duration comparing sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin to a sulphonylurea agent added to ongoing metformin, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulphonylurea agent are as follows: anorexia (Metabolism and nutritional disorders; frequency uncommon) and weight decreased (Investigations; frequency uncommon).
In a 24-week study of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin administered twice daily (sitagliptin/ metformin 50 mg/ 500 mg or 50 mg/ 1,000 mg), the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with placebo was 14.0% and 9.7%, respectively.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0% each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7%), with the differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
Additional information on the individual active substances of the fixed dose combination Sitagliptin In addition, in monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks in duration of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily alone compared to placebo, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness.

It can also be used in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis who have not taken methotrexate before; • polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (a rare childhood disease causing inflammation of many joints) in children aged four to 17 years who have not responded adequately to or cannot take methotrexate; • psoriatic arthritis (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin and inflammation of the joints) in adults who have not responded adequately to other treatments; • severe ankylosing spondylitis (a disease causing inflammation of the joints of the spine) in adults who have not responded adequately to other treatments; • plaque psoriasis (a disease causing red, scaly patches on the skin) in adults with moderate to severe disease and in children from the age of eight years with chronic (long-term) severe disease.
In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of Enbrel when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of Enbrel and methotrexate alone.
A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with Enbrel in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown Enbrel to be an effective treatment for Wegener’ s granulomatosis.
In addition, in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with Enbrel (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
This experience includes 2 placebo-controlled studies (349 Enbrel patients and 152 placebo patients) and 2 active-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel to methotrexate (415 Enbrel patients and 217 methotrexate patients) and another active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel (223 patients), methotrexate (228 patients) and Enbrel in combination with methotrexate (231 patients).
Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1000 ,< 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000); not known (could not be accurately estimated through clinical studies).
Among rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients in placebo-controlled, active-controlled, and open-label trials of Enbrel, serious adverse events reported included malignancies (see below), asthma, infections (see below), heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, chest pain, syncope, cerebral ischaemia, hypertension, hypotension, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, bursitis, confusion, depression, dyspnoea, abnormal healing, renal insufficiency, kidney calculus, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, membranous glomerulonephropathy, polymyositis, thrombophlebitis, liver damage, leucopenia, paresis, paresthesia, vertigo, allergic alveolitis, angioedema, scleritis, bone fracture, lymphadenopathy, ulcerative colitis, intestinal obstruction, eosinophilia, haematuria, and sarcoidosis.
These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection.
The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to none of placebo-treated patients).
Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/ personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/ gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection.
In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving Enbrel during 3 months of the study (part 1 open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy.
This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis, and four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis.
In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with Enbrel alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and of the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate.
Pairwise comparison p-values: * = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel vs methotrexate, † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs methotrexate and  = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs Enbrel
In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the Enbrel in combination with methotrexate group compared with the Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p < 0.05).
Responses were measured using the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI), defined as  30% improvement in at least three of six and  30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/ parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
(1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-like ankylosis.
The largest of these trials (n= 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of  30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of  30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI).
Patients who “ failed to respond to ” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI < 50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available.
The efficacy of Enbrel was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by a sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12).
In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 3% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/ l vs 2.6 mg/ l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/ l vs 1.4 mg/ l, and partial AUC of 297 mgh/ l vs 316 mgh/ l for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (n=21) vs 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly (n=16), respectively.
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466  g hr/ ml and 474  g  hr/ ml for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (N= 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively.
Enbrel did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/ kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg.
There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with Enbrel (see section 4.8) Although no clinical trials have been performed evaluating Enbrel therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity.
In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of Enbrel when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of Enbrel and methotrexate alone.
A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with Enbrel in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown Enbrel to be an effective treatment for Wegener’ s granulomatosis.
In addition, in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with Enbrel (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
This experience includes 2 placebo-controlled studies (349 Enbrel patients and 152 placebo patients) and 2 active-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel to methotrexate (415 Enbrel patients and 217 methotrexate patients) amd another active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel (223 patients), methotrexate (228 patients) and Enbrel in combination with methotrexate (231 patients).
Additionally, Enbrel has been studied in240 psoriatic arthritis patients who participated in 2 double-blind placebo- controlled studies and an open-label extension study Five hundred and eight (508) ankylosing spondylitis patients were treated with Enbrel in 4 double-blind placebo-controlled studies.
Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1000 ,< 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000); not known (could not be accurately estimated through clinical studies).
Among rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients in placebo-controlled, active-controlled, and open-label trials of Enbrel, serious adverse events reported included malignancies (see below), asthma, infections (see below), heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, chest pain, syncope, cerebral ischaemia, hypertension, hypotension, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, bursitis, confusion, depression, dyspnoea, abnormal healing, renal insufficiency, kidney calculus, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, membranous glomerulonephropathy, polymyositis, thrombophlebitis, liver damage, leucopenia, paresis, paresthesia, vertigo, allergic alveolitis, angioedema, scleritis, bone fracture, lymphadenopathy, ulcerative colitis, intestinal obstruction, eosinophilia, haematuria, and sarcoidosis.
These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection.
The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to none of placebo-treated patients).

In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving Enbrel during 3 months of the study (part 1 open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy.
This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis, and four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis.
In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with Enbrel alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and of the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate.

Enbrel did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/ kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg.
In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of Enbrel when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of Enbrel and methotrexate alone.
A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with Enbrel in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown Enbrel to be an effective treatment for Wegener’ s granulomatosis.
In addition, in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with Enbrel (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
This experience includes 2 placebo-controlled studies (349 Enbrel patients and 152 placebo patients) and 2 active-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel to methotrexate (415 Enbrel patients and 217 methotrexate patients) and another active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel (223 patients), methotrexate (228 patients) and Enbrel in combination with methotrexate (231 patients).
Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1000 ,< 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000); not known (could not be accurately estimated through clinical studies).
Among rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients in placebo-controlled, active-controlled, and open-label trials of Enbrel, serious adverse events reported included malignancies (see below), asthma, infections (see below), heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, chest pain, syncope, cerebral ischaemia, hypertension, hypotension, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, bursitis, confusion, depression, dyspnoea, abnormal healing, renal insufficiency, kidney calculus, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, membranous glomerulonephropathy, polymyositis, thrombophlebitis, liver damage, leucopenia, paresis, paresthesia, vertigo, allergic alveolitis, angioedema, scleritis, bone fracture, lymphadenopathy, ulcerative colitis, intestinal obstruction, eosinophilia, haematuria, and sarcoidosis.
These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection.
The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to none of placebo-treated patients).
Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/ personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/ gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection.
In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving Enbrel during 3 months of the study (part 1 open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy.
This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis, and four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis.
In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with Enbrel alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and of the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate.
Pairwise comparison p-values: * = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel vs methotrexate, † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs methotrexate and  = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs Enbrel
In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the Enbrel in combination with methotrexate group compared with the Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p < 0.05).
Responses were measured using the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI), defined as  30% improvement in at least three of six and  30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/ parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

The largest of these trials (n= 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of  30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of  30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI).
Patients who “ failed to respond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI < 50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available.
The efficacy of Enbrel was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by a sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12).
In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 3% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/ l vs 2.6 mg/ l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/ l vs 1.4 mg/ l and partial AUC of 297 mgh/ l vs 316 mgh/ l for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (n=21) vs 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly (n=16), respectively.
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466  g hr/ ml and 474  g hr/ ml for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (N= 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively.
Enbrel did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/ kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg.
There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with Enbrel (see section 4.8) Although no clinical trials have been performed evaluating Enbrel therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity.
In a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of Enbrel when given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of Enbrel and methotrexate alone.

A placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with Enbrel in addition to standard therapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of 25 months, has not shown Enbrel to be an effective treatment for Wegener’ s granulomatosis.
In addition, in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with Enbrel (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
This experience includes 2 placebo-controlled studies (349 Enbrel patients and 152 placebo patients) and 2 active-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel to methotrexate (415 Enbrel patients and 217 methotrexate patients) and another active-controlled trial comparing Enbrel (223 patients), methotrexate (228 patients) and Enbrel in combination with methotrexate (231 patients).
Within the organ system classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience the reaction), using the following categories: very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1000 ,< 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000); not known (could not be accurately estimated through clinical studies).
Among rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients in placebo-controlled, active-controlled, and open-label trials of Enbrel, serious adverse events reported included malignancies (see below), asthma, infections (see below), heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, chest pain, syncope, cerebral ischaemia, hypertension, hypotension, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, bursitis, confusion, depression, dyspnoea, abnormal healing, renal insufficiency, kidney calculus, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, membranous glomerulonephropathy, polymyositis, thrombophlebitis, liver damage, leucopenia, paresis, paresthesia, vertigo, allergic alveolitis, angioedema, scleritis, bone fracture, lymphadenopathy, ulcerative colitis, intestinal obstruction, eosinophilia, haematuria, and sarcoidosis.
These included abscess (at various sites), bacteraemia, bronchitis, bursitis, cellulitis, cholecystitis, diarrhoea, diverticulitis, endocarditis (suspected), gastroenteritis, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, leg ulcer, mouth infection, osteomyelitis, otitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, septic arthritis, sinusitis, skin infection, skin ulcer, urinary tract infection, vasculitis, and wound infection.
The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to none of placebo-treated patients).
Severe adverse events reported included varicella with signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae (see also section 4.4), appendicitis, gastroenteritis, depression/ personality disorder, cutaneous ulcer, oesophagitis/ gastritis, group A streptococcal septic shock, type I diabetes mellitus, and soft tissue and post-operative wound infection.
In one study in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis aged 4 to 17 years, 43 of 69 (62%) children experienced an infection while receiving Enbrel during 3 months of the study (part 1 open-label), and the frequency and severity of infections was similar in 58 patients completing 12 months of open-label extension therapy.
This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, one study in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis, and four studies in adults with plaque psoriasis.
In another active-controlled, double-blind, randomised study, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic progression in RA patients treated with Enbrel alone (25 mg twice weekly), methotrexate alone (7.5 to 20 mg weekly, median dose 20 mg), and of the combination of Enbrel and methotrexate initiated concurrently were compared in 682 adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis of 6 months to 20 years duration (median 5 years) who had a less than satisfactory response to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) other than methotrexate.
Pairwise comparison p-values: * = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel vs methotrexate, † = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs methotrexate and  = p < 0.05 for comparisons of Enbrel + methotrexate vs Enbrel
In an analysis in which all patients who dropped out of the study for any reason were considered to have progressed, the percentage of patients without progression (TSS change ≤ 0.5) at 24 months was higher in the Enbrel in combination with methotrexate group compared with the Enbrel alone and methotrexate alone groups (62%, 50%, and 36%, respectively; p < 0.05).
Responses were measured using the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI), defined as  30% improvement in at least three of six and  30% worsening in no more than one of six JRA core set criteria, including active joint count, limitation of motion, physician and patient/ parent global assessments, functional assessment, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
(1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of psoriasis); (3) arthritis mutilans; (4) asymmetric psoriatic arthritis; or (5) spondylitis-like ankylosis.
The largest of these trials (n= 277) enrolled patients who were between 18 and 70 years of age and had active ankylosing spondylitis defined as visual analog scale (VAS) scores of  30 for average of duration and intensity of morning stiffness plus VAS scores of  30 for at least 2 of the following 3 parameters: patient global assessment; average of VAS values for nocturnal back pain and total back pain; average of 10 questions on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI).
Patients who “ failed to respond to” in the target population is defined by insufficient response (PASI < 50 or PGA less than good), or worsening of the disease while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a sufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the three major systemic therapies as available.
The efficacy of Enbrel was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 211 paediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (as defined by a sPGA score ≥ 3, involving ≥ 10% of the BSA, and PASI ≥ 12).
In subjects treated with approved doses of etanercept in clinical trials for up to 12 months, cumulative rates of anti-etanercept antibodies were approximately 6% of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 7.5% of subjects with psoriatic arthritis, 2% of subjects with ankylosing spondylitis, 7% of subjects with psoriasis, 9.7% of subjects with paediatric psoriasis, and 3% of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Mean serum concentration profiles at steady state in treated RA patients were Cmax of 2.4 mg/ l vs 2.6 mg/ l, Cmin of 1.2 mg/ l vs 1.4 mg/ l and partial AUC of 297 mgh/ l vs 316 mgh/ l for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (n=21) vs 25 mg Enbrel twice weekly (n=16), respectively.
In a population pharmacokinetics analysis in ankylosing spondylitis patients the etanercept steady state AUCs were 466  g hr/ ml and 474  g hr/ ml for 50 mg Enbrel once weekly (N= 154) and 25 mg twice weekly (N = 148), respectively.
Enbrel did not elicit dose-limiting or target organ toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys following twice weekly subcutaneous administration for 4 or 26 consecutive weeks at a dose (15 mg/ kg) that resulted in AUC-based serum drug concentrations that were over 27-fold higher than that obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg.

When the results of the five studies comparing Tekturna taken alone with placebo were looked at together, patients aged under 65 had an average fall in diastolic blood pressure of 9.0 mmHg after eight weeks of taking 150 mg Tekturna, from an average of 99.4 mmHg at the start of the study.
Renal impairment In clinical studies Tekturna has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol/ l or 1.70 mg/ dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol/ l or 2.00 mg/ dl in men and/ or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/ min), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension.
The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials.
The adverse drug reactions (Table 1) are ranked under heading of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
6 Hypertension In hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Tekturna at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg provided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to trough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose.
In patients who did not adequately respond to 5 mg of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the addition of Tekturna 150 mg had a blood-pressure-lowering effect similar to that obtained by increasing amlodipine dose to 10 mg, but had a lower incidence of oedema (aliskiren 150 mg/ amlodipine 5 mg 2.1% vs. amlodipine 10 mg 11.2%).
In a 6-month study of 599 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nephropathy, all of whom were receiving losartan 100 mg and optimised antihypertensive background therapy, addition of Tekturna 300 mg achieved a 20% reduction versus placebo in urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR), i. e. from 58 mg/ mmol to 46 mg/ mmol.
Although aliskiren has known irritation potential, safety margins obtained in humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy volunteers were considered to be appropriate at 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold based on mucosa concentrations in comparison with 250 mg/ kg/ day in the rat carcinogenicity study.
Renal impairment In clinical studies Tekturna has not been investigated in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine ≥ 150 μ mol/ l or 1.70 mg/ dl in women and ≥ 177 μ mol/ l or 2.00 mg/ dl in men and/ or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/ min), history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome or renovascular hypertension.

Oral contraceptives Co-administration of rufinamide 800 mg b. i. d. and a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyloestradiol 35 μ g and norethindrone 1 mg) for 14 days resulted in a mean decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC0-24 of 22% and in norethindrone AUC0-24 of 14%.
Clinical experience Inovelon was administered in a double blind, placebo-controlled study, at doses of up to 45 mg/ kg/ day for 84 days, to 139 patients with inadequately controlled seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (including both atypical absence seizures and drop attacks). Male or female patients (between 4 and 30 years of age) were included if they were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant fixed-dose antiepileptic drugs.
A significant improvement was observed for all three primary variables: the percentage change in total seizure frequency per 28 days during the maintenance phase relative to baseline (-35.8% on Inovelon vs. – 1.6% on placebo, p= 0.0006), the number of tonic-atonic seizures (-42.9% on Inovelon vs.

The most common side effects with Abraxane (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), leucopenia (low levels of leucocytes, a type of white blood cell), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), lymphopenia (low levels of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), neuropathy (nerve damage), hypoaesthesia (reduced sense of touch), paraesthesia (unusual sensations like pins and needles), nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth), alopecia (hair loss), rash, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), anorexia (loss of appetite), fatigue (tiredness), asthenia (weakness) and pyrexia (fever).
Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit (e. g. erythromycin, fluoxetine, imidazole antifungals) or induce (e. g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.
Nail bed tenderness, urticaria, skin pain, photosensitivity reaction, pigmentation disorder, pruritic rash, skin disorder, hyperhidrosis, onychomadesis, erythematous rash, generalised rash, dermatitis, night sweats, maculo-papular rash, vitiligo, hypotrichosis, nail discomfort, generalized pruritus, macular rash, papular rash, skin lesion, swollen face Very Common:
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel, either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).
Based on the published literature, in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM, indicate that about 87% of paclitaxel is bound; the presence of ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.
Based on the published literature, in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel; and to two minor metabolites, 3’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3’ -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel.
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4% of the total administered dose with less than 1% as the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating extensive non-renal clearance.

Patients with normal (creatinine clearance CrCl > 80 ml/ min), mild (CrCl 60 - 80 ml/ min), moderate (CrCl 30 - < 60 ml/ min), or severe (< 30 ml/ min) renal impairment received hydroxycarbamide as a single dose of 15 mg/ kg b. w. by using 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg capsules.
As evaluated in a further study, in patients with a CrCl < 60 ml/ min the area under the curve was approximately 51% higher than in patients with a CrCl ≥ 60 ml/ min, which suggests that a dose reduction of hydroxycarbamide by 50% may be appropriate in patients with a CrCl < 60 ml/ min.

Alternatively, when Prevenar is given as part of a ‘ universal infant immunisation programme’ (when all infants in an area are vaccinated at around the same time), two doses can be given with an interval of at least two months, followed by a booster at 11 to 15 months of age. • Infants aged between seven and 11 months need two doses, with an interval of at least one month between doses.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Prevenar’ s benefits are greater than its risks for active immunisation against disease caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, bacteraemia and acute otitis media) in infants and children from two months up to five years of age.

Active immunisation against disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, bacteraemia and acute otitis media) in infants and children from 2 months up to 5 years of age (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).
The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine does not replace the use of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children ≥ 24 months of age with conditions (such as sickle cell disease, asplenia, HIV infection, chronic illness or who are immunocompromised) placing them at higher risk for invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.
When Prevenar is co-administered with hexavalent vaccines (DTaP/ Hib(PRP-T)/ IPV/ HepB), the physician should be aware that data from clinical studies indicate that the rate of febrile reactions was higher compared to that occurring following the administration of hexavalent vaccines alone.
In a clinical trial that compared separate with concomitant administrations of Prevenar (three doses at 2, 3.5, 6 months and a booster dose at approximately 12 months) and Meningitec (meningococcal C conjugate vaccine; two doses at 2 and 6 months and a booster dose at approximately 12 months) there was no evidence of immune interference between the two conjugate vaccines after the primary series or after the booster doses.
When Prevenar is co-administered with hexavalent vaccines (DTaP/ Hib(PRP-T)/ IPV/ HepB), fever ≥ 38 °C per dose was reported in 28.3% to 48.3% of infants in the group receiving Prevenar and the hexavalent vaccine at the same time as compared to 15.6% to 23.4% in the group receiving the hexavalent vaccine alone.
Efficacy of Prevenar against acute otitis media (AOM) was assessed in a randomised, double blind, clinical trial of 1,662 Finnish infants immunised with either Prevenar or a control vaccine (Hepatitis B vaccine), at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age.
Preliminary data from England and Wales reported less than 1 year following introduction of routine immunisation at 2, 4 and 13 months with a single dose catch-up programme for children 13 to 23 months of age have suggested that effectiveness of this schedule might be lower against serotype 6B than against the other serotypes in the vaccine.

When initiating treatment with buprenorphine, the physician must be aware of the partial agonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients particularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short acting opioid, or if administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone (see section 4.2).
This product should be used with care in patients with: asthma or respiratory insufficiency (cases of respiratory depression have been reported with buprenorphine); renal insufficiency (30% of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal route; thus, renal elimination may be prolonged); hepatic insufficiency (hepatic metabolism of buprenorphine may be altered) (see section 4.3).
• other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e. g. methadone, analgesics and antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances: these combinations increase central nervous system depression.
• CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of buprenorphine (approximately 70% and 50% respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of norbuprenorphine.
Buprenorphine used alone for treatment of opioid dependency has been associated with the following symptoms (> 1%): constipation, headache, insomnia, asthenia, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, fainting and dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, and sweating.
In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution to a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/ day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/ day of Suboxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough to serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance phase and a 7- week detoxification phase.
The combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat.
A peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with Suboxone; however, maternal oral administration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in difficult parturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal mortality and a slight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting reflex and startle response) in neonatal rats.

Take special care with Suboxone Misuse and abuse Some people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) because they misused buprenorphine or took it in combination with other Central Nervous System depressants, such as alcohol, benzodiazepines (tranquilisers), or other opioids.
These injuries could be due to special conditions as viral infections (chronic C hepatitis), alcohol abuse, anorexia, or medicines association (for example: antiretroviral nucleoside analogues, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), amiodarone, isoniazid, valproate).
The following medicines may increase the buprenorphine blood concentrations, so concomitant use of these medicines together with Suboxone should be closely monitored and could require in some cases a dose reduction by your doctor: • anti-retrovirals (ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir) • ketoconazole • itraconazole
Common side effects (occurring in at least 1 in 100 patients) that may occur during treatment with Suboxone are: weight loss, swelling (hands and feet), tiredness, drowsiness, anxiety, nervousness, tingling, depression, decreased sexual drive, muscle spasms, abnormal thinking, tearing disorder, blurred vision, flushing, increased blood pressure, migraines, runny nose, sore throat and painful swallowing, increased cough, upset stomach, diarrhoea, abnormal liver function, loss of appetite, flatulence, vomiting, rash, itching, hives, pain, joint pain, muscle pain, leg cramps, impotence, urine abnormality, abdominal pain, back pain, weakness, infection, chills, chest pain, fever, flu syndrome, feeling of general discomfort, accidental injury, faintness and dizziness, drop in blood pressure on changing position from sitting or lying down to standing.
Uncommon side effects (occurring in at least 1 in 1,000 patients) with Suboxone are: swollen glands (lymph nodes), agitation, tremor, abnormal dream, excessive muscle activity, depersonalization (not feeling like yourself), medicine dependence, amnesia (memory disturbance), loss of interest, exaggerated feeling of well being, convulsion (fits), speech disorder, small pupil size, problems with urination, conjunctivitis, rapid or slow heart beat, low blood pressure, palpitations, myocardial infarction (heart attack), shortness of breath, asthma, yawning, pain and sores in mouth, tongue discolouration, acne, skin nodule, hair loss, dry or scaling skin, inflammation of joints, urinary tract infection, blood in urine, abnormal ejaculation, menstrual or vaginal problems, kidney stone, sensitivity to heat or cold, allergic reaction, feelings of hostility.

Pulmonary hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. ‘ Primary ’ means that there are no other diseases of the heart or lungs causing the high blood pressure, and the ‘ class’ reflects the severity of the symptoms caused by the disease: ‘ class III’ involves marked limitation of physical activity.
A ‘ response’ was defined as a combination of a 10% improvement in exercise capacity (measured by looking at how far the patient could walk in six minutes) and an improvement of the patient ’ s condition (the severity of the disease going down by at least one class), without a worsening of pulmonary hypertension or death.
The recommended dose is 2.5 micrograms or 5.0 micrograms of inhaled iloprost (as delivered at the mouthpiece of the nebuliser), starting with the low dose of 2.5 microgram for the first inhalation, followed by 5.0 micrograms for the second inhalation.
Since the I-Neb nebuliser has been shown to produce an aerosol with slightly different physical characteristics to those of HaloLite, Prodose and VentaNeb devices and a faster delivery of the solution (see section 5.2), patients stabilized on one nebuliser should not switch to another nebuliser without supervision by the treating physician.
− Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. − Conditions where the effects of Ventavis on platelets might increase the risk of haemorrhage (e. g. active peptic ulcers, trauma, intracranial haemorrhage). − Severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina; − Myocardial infarction within the last six months; − Decompensated cardiac failure if not under close medical supervision;
4 − Severe arrhythmias; cerebrovascular events (e. g. transient ischaemic attack, stroke) within the last 3 months. − Pulmonary hypertension due to venous occlusive disease. − Congenital or acquired valvular defects with clinically relevant myocardial function disorders not related to pulmonary hypertension. − Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6).
5 Iloprost can inhibit platelet function and its use with anticoagulants (such as heparin, coumarin-type anticoagulants) or other inhibitors of platelet aggregation (such as acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, ticlopidine, clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa antagonists: abciximab, eptifibatide and tirofiban) may increase the risk of bleeding.
In a randomized placebo-controlled study in 160 healthy volunteers, inhaled doses of iloprost solution were given either with a fixed dose of 2.5 micrograms iloprost 6 times daily (total daily dose of 15 micrograms), or beginning with 5.0 microgram and increasing up to 20 micrograms, or the highest tolerated dose for a total of 6 dose inhalations (total daily dose of 70 micrograms).
In the fixed dose group of 2.5 micrograms per inhalation chest pain, or chest discomfort (32.5%), pharyngolaryngeal pain, or throat irritation (22.5%) and nausea (7.5%) – (all non-serious and mild in intensity) – occurred more frequently in comparison with the adverse events obtained from the placebo controlled phase II and III studies in patients with doses of 2.5 micrograms or 5 micrograms per inhalation.
Inhaled iloprost (or placebo) was added to patients' current therapy, which could include a combination of anticoagulants, vasodilators (e. g. calcium channel blockers), diuretics, oxygen, and digitalis, but not PGI2 (prostacyclin or its analogues).
The primary efficacy endpoint defined for this study, was a combined response criterion consisting of improvement in exercise capacity (6 minute walk test) at 12 weeks by at least 10% versus baseline, and improvement by at least one NYHA class at 12 weeks versus baseline, and no deterioration of pulmonary hypertension or death at any time before 12 weeks.
A mean increase in the 6-minute walk test of 44.7 meters from a baseline mean value of 329 meters vs. a change of -7.4 meters from a baseline mean value of 324 meters in the placebo group (no data imputation for death or missing values) was observed in the subgroup of 49 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension receiving treatment of inhaled iloprost for 12 weeks (46 patients in the placebo group).
In a study with intravenous infusion of iloprost, patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing intermittent dialysis treatment are shown to have a significantly lower clearance (mean CL = 5 ± 2 ml/ minute/ kg) than that observed in patients with renal failure not undergoing intermittent dialysis treatment (mean CL = 18 ± 2 ml/ minute/ kg).

• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to iloprost or any of the other ingredients of Ventavis. • If you are at risk of bleeding – for example, active stomach ulcers, injuries, or other bleeding • If you have a significant suspected build-up of fluid in the lungs, with difficulty in breathing • If your disease is due to a blocked or narrow vein rather than a blocked or narrow artery. • If you have had a stroke within the last 3 months, or any other interruption of blood supply to the brain • If you have a heart problem, for example:
You will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure • If you tend to faint as soon as you get out of bed, it may be helpful to take your first dose of the day while you’ re still lying down. • Avoid any exceptional straining, for example physical exertion; it might be useful to inhale Ventavis before. such physical exertion • Have someone on standby to watch you, if possible.
Be specially careful to mention any of these: • Medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart disease • Medicines which inhibit blood clotting (this includes acetylsalicylic acid a substance present in many medicines that lower fever and relieve pain, as well as others) Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid when using Ventavis, so always tell them if you are taking other medicines.
Pain, discomfort in the breast (32.5%), pain when swallowing (pharyngolaryngeal pain, throat irritation (22.5%)) and nausea (7.5%) were adverse events that occurred in healthy volunteers in a special study, when they received fixed 2.5 microgram 6 times daily.
Caution is recommended during concomitant use of Kuvan with all agents that cause vasodilation, including those administered topically, by affecting nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or action including classical NO donors (e. g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), molsidomin), phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and minoxidil.
Hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) is diagnosed as an abnormal elevation in blood phenylalanine levels and is usually caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the genes encoding for phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (in the case of phenylketonuria, PKU) or for the enzymes involved in 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4) biosynthesis or regeneration (in the case of BH4 deficiency).
The rationale for administration of Kuvan in patients with BH4-responsive PKU is to enhance the activity of the defective phenylalanine hydroxylase and thereby increase or restore the oxidative metabolism of phenylalanine sufficient to reduce or maintain blood phenylalanine levels, prevent or decrease further phenylalanine accumulation, and increase tolerance to phenylalanine intake in the diet.
The mean ± SD decrease from baseline in blood phenylalanine levels at the end of the 6 week study period was 235.9 ± 257.0 μ mol/ l for the sapropterin treated group (n=47) as compared to an increase of 2.9 ± 239.5 μ mol/ l for the placebo group (n=41) (p < 0.001).
For patients with baseline blood phenylalanine levels ≥ 600 µmol/ l, 41.9% (13/ 31) of those treated with sapropterin and 13.2% (5/ 38) of those treated with placebo had blood phenylalanine levels < 600 µmol/ l at the end of the 6-week study period (p=0.012).
In a separate 10-week, placebo-controlled study, 45 PKU patients with blood phenylalanine levels controlled on a stable phenylalanine-restricted diet (blood phenylalanine ≤ 480 μ mol/ l on enrolment) were randomized 3:1 to treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/ kg/ day (n=33) or placebo (n=12).
After 3 weeks of treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/ kg/ day, blood phenylalanine levels were significantly reduced; the mean ± SD decrease from baseline in blood phenylalanine level within this group was 148.5 ±134.2 μ mol/ l (p < 0.001).
After 3 weeks, subjects in both the sapropterin and placebo treatment groups were continued on their phenylalanine-restricted diets and dietary phenylalanine intake was increased or decreased using standardized phenylalanine supplements with a goal to maintain blood phenylalanine levels at < 360 μ mol/ l.
The mean ± SD increase in dietary phenylalanine tolerance was 17.513 ±13.268 mg/ kg/ day for the group treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/ kg/ day, compared to 3.259 ± 5.291 mg/ kg/ day for the placebo group (p = 0.006).
For the sapropterin treatment group, the mean ± SD total dietary phenylalanine tolerance was 38.406 ± 21.606 mg/ kg/ day during treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/ kg/ day compared to 15.660 ± 7.159 mg/ kg/ day before treatment.

Of evaluable patients treated with ertapenem in a clinical study for the treatment of intra- abdominal infections, in adults, 30% had generalized peritonitis and 39% had infections involving sites other than the appendix including the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, colon, and gallbladder; there were limited numbers of evaluable patients who were enrolled with APACHE II scores ≥ 15 and efficacy in these patients has not been established.
For patients who received only INVANZ, the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities and their respective incidence rates during therapy plus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped were: elevations in ALT (4.6%), AST (4.6%), alkaline phosphatase (3.8%) and platelet count (3.0%).

Plasma concentrations Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 1 g dose in healthy young adults (25 to 45 years of age) were 155 micrograms/ ml (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), 9 micrograms/ ml at 12 hour postdose, and 1 microgram/ ml at 24 hour postdose.
Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 15 mg/ kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 3 to 23 months of age were 103.8 micrograms/ ml (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), 13.5 micrograms/ ml at 6 hour postdose, and 2.5 micrograms/ ml at 12 hour postdose.
Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 15 mg/ kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 2 to 12 years of age were 113.2 micrograms/ ml (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), 12.8 micrograms/ ml at 6 hour postdose, and 3.0 micrograms/ ml at 12 hour postdose.
Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 20 mg/ kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 13 to 17 years of age were 170.4 micrograms/ ml (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), 7.0 micrograms/ ml at 12 hour postdose, and 1.1 microgram/ ml at 24 hour postdose.
11 Average plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a 1 g dose in three patients 13 to 17 years of age were 155.9 micrograms/ ml (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), and 6.2 micrograms/ ml at 12 hour postdose.
In healthy young adults (25 to 45 years of age), the protein binding of ertapenem decreases, as plasma concentrations increase, from approximately 95% bound at an approximate plasma concentration of < 50 micrograms/ ml to approximately 92% bound at an approximate plasma concentration of 155 micrograms/ ml (average concentration achieved at the end of infusion following 1 g intravenously).
The volume of distribution (Vdss) of ertapenem in adults is approximately 8 litres (0.11 liter/ kg) and approximately 0.2 liter/ kg in paediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age and approximately 0.16 liter/ kg in paediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age.
Plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a single 15 mg/ kg intravenous dose of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age are comparable to plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a 1 g once daily intravenous dose in adults (see Plasma concentrations).
Renal Insufficiency Following a single 1 g intravenous dose of ertapenem in adults, AUCs of total ertapenem (bound and unbound) and of unbound ertapenem are similar in patients with mild renal insufficiency (Clcr 60 to 90 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) compared with healthy subjects (ages 25 to 82 years).

Persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e. g. hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions.
Post-licensing experience with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck) suggests that transmission of varicella vaccine virus may rarely occur between healthy vaccine recipients who develop a varicella- like rash and contacts susceptible to varicella, as well as high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella (see section 4.8).
Although mumps vaccine virus has been shown to infect the placenta and foetus, there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations in humans; (3) In a 15-year survey involving over 1100 pregnant women who received rubella vaccine within 3 months before or after conception (of whom 635 received the Wistar RA 27/ 3 strain), none of the newborns had abnormalities compatible with congenital rubella syndrome; and (4) Wild-type varicella is known to cause foetal harm, and is associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster in the first year of life and severe varicella in the newborn infant.
The only vaccine-related systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater rate in individuals who received the earlier formulation of ProQuad compared to individuals who received the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck) were fever (≥ 38.9°C oral equivalent or abnormal) and measles-like rash.
Additionally, other adverse experiences have been reported with post- marketing use of ProQuad and/ or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of either the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., the monovalent component vaccines of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., or Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck).

Rare: bronchiolitis, candida nappy rash, candidiasis, cellulitis, infectious croup, viral gastroenteritis, hand-foot-mouth disease, influenza, pseudocroup, respiratory infection, skin infection, tonsillitis, varicella ‡, viral conjunctivitis.
Not known: afebrile convulsions or seizures, Bell’ s palsy, cerebrovascular accident, dizziness, dream abnormality, encephalitis (see below), encephalopathy (see below), Guillain-Barré syndrome, measles inclusion body encephalitis (see section 4.3), ocular palsies, paraesthesia, polyneuritis, polyneuropathy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (see below), syncope, transverse myelitis, tremor.
Consistent with clinical study data on the timing of fever and measles-like rash, an analysis of a post-marketing observational safety study in children (N=31,298, 99% in their second year of life) receiving their first dose of vaccine has shown that febrile seizures occurred more frequently 5-12 days following vaccination with ProQuad (n=22; 0.7 per 1000 children) when compared with data from children in a historical, age- and gender- matched, control group vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck) concomitantly (N=31,298) before ProQuad was available (n=10; 0.3 per 1000 children).
In the 0-30 day time period following vaccination, the incidence of febrile seizures with ProQuad (n=44; 1.4 per 1000 children) was similar to that observed in children receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck) concomitantly (n=40; 1.3 per 1000 children).
Not known: injection site complaints (burning and/ or stinging of short duration, eczema, oedema/ swelling, hive-like rash, hematoma, induration, lump, vesicles, wheal and flare), inflammation, lip abnormality, papillitis, roughness/ dryness, stiffness, trauma, varicella-like rash, venipuncture site haemorrhage, warm sensation, warm to touch.
In a study comparing 1 dose (N=1114) to 2 doses (N=1102) of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck), the estimated vaccine efficacy against all severities of varicella disease for the 10-year observation period was 94% for 1 dose and 98% for 2 doses (p < 0.001).
Immunogenicity Immunogenicity was studied in children 12 through 23 months of age with a negative clinical history of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella who participated in 5 randomized clinical trials. The immunogenicity of the current refrigerator-stable formulation was shown to be similar to the immunogenicity of the earlier formulation of ProQuad six weeks after a single dose of the vaccine.
The immunogenicity of a single dose of an earlier formulation of ProQuad was comparable to the immunogenicity of a single dose of its individual component vaccines (Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.), currently used in routine vaccination in some countries.
The immunogenicity and safety of ProQuad were evaluated in a clinical trial involving 799 subjects 4 through 6 years of age who had received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at least 1 month prior to study entry.
Following the dose of ProQuad, GMTs for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were similar to those following a second dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/ Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. administered concomitantly at separate injection sites.
The antibody persistence rates 1 year postvaccination in recipients of a single dose of ProQuad were 98.9% (1722/ 1741) for measles, 96.7% (1676/ 1733) for mumps, 99.6% (1796/ 1804) for rubella, and 97.5% (1512/ 1550) for varicella (≥ 5 gpELISA Units/ ml).

Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone Adults and elderly The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone is 4 mg reconstituted and further diluted Zometa solution for infusion (diluted with 100 ml 0.9% w/ v sodium chloride or 5% w/ v glucose solution), given in no less than a 15-minute intravenous infusion every 3 to 4 weeks.
Treatment of TIH Adults and elderly The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/ dl or 3.0 mmol/ l) is 4 mg reconstituted and further diluted Zometa solution for infusion (diluted with 100 ml sterile 0.9% w/ v sodium chloride or 5% w/ v glucose solution), given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes.
In view of the potential impact of bisphosphonates, including Zometa, on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in patients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine ≥ 400 µmol/ l or ≥ 4.5 mg/ dl for patients with TIH and ≥ 265 µmol/ l or ≥ 3.0 mg/ dl for patients with cancer and bone metastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min), the use of Zometa is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.
In one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively.
Zometa was also studied in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 228 patients with documented bone metastases from breast cancer to evaluate the effect of Zometa on the skeletal related event (SRE) rate ratio, calculated as the total number of SRE events (excluding hypercalcaemia and adjusted for prior fracture), divided by the total risk period.
After initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of drug rapidly increased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of drug on day 28.
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours.
Population analysis showed that for a patient with creatinine clearance of 20 ml/ min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/ min (moderate impairment), the corresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a patient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/ min.
The safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal studies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/ kg) and multiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06– 0.6 mg/ kg/ day) did not indicate renal effects at doses equivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose.

If liver transferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in total bilirubin > 2x ULN, treatment should be stopped and re-introduction of Thelin is not to be considered.
Concomitant administration of Thelin and Ortho- Novum 1/ 35 (1 mg norethindrone/ 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol) resulted in increases in exposure to ethinyl estradiol (substrate of CYP3A4/ 5) and norethindrone (CYP3A4/ 5) of 59% and 47%, respectively.
ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as other cardiovascular disorders and connective tissue diseases, including scleroderma, acute and chronic heart failure, myocardial ischaemia, systemic hypertension, and atherosclerosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of ET-1 in these diseases.
Compared with placebo treatment, Thelin resulted in improvement (p < 0.05) in cardiac index of +0.3 L/ min/ m2 (13%), in pulmonary vascular resistance of-221 dynes*sec/ cm5 (22%), and in systemic vascular resistance of -276 dynes*sec/ cm5 (16%) after 12 weeks of treatment.

The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection (3 ml, 30 mg) applied subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you notice the attack of hereditary angioedema becoming moderately or severely worse (for example increased skin swelling, particularly affecting the face and neck, or increasing tummy pain).
20 The frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (affects more than 1 user in 10), common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100), uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000), rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000), very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000), not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Exjade is used to treat a condition called chronic iron overload (an excess of iron in the body), which results from having repeated blood transfusions. • Exjade is used to reduce the amount of iron in the body of patients from six years of age who suffer from an inherited disease called beta thalassaemia major and who receive frequent blood transfusions to treat it.
Frequent transfusions are defined as at least 7 ml of packed (concentrated) red blood cells per kilogram body weight in a month. • Exjade is also used when deferoxamine (another medicine used to treat iron overload) cannot be used or is inadequate, in patients who suffer from other types of anaemia, in children aged from two to five years, and in patients with beta thalassaemia major who receive less frequent transfusions.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Exjade’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions in patients with beta thalassaemia major, and due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate.

For patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE that is numerically half that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered (e. g. a patient receiving 40 mg/ kg/ day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be transferred to a starting daily dose of 20 mg/ kg/ day of EXJADE).
Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and with the Schwartz formula in children) and/ or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with EXJADE, and monthly thereafter.
For adult patients, the daily dose may be reduced by 10 mg/ kg if a rise in serum creatinine by > 33% above the average of the pre-treatment measurements and estimated creatinine clearance decreases below the lower limit of the normal range (< 90 ml/ min) are seen at two consecutive visits, and cannot be attributed to other causes (see section 4.2).
If, despite dose reduction and interruption, the serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and there is also persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e. g. proteinuria, Fanconi’ s Syndrome), the patient should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal biopsy) may be considered.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor (30 mg/ kg daily), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 substrate, given as a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and C max about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) and 1.6-fold (90% CI
Adverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); not known (cannot be estimated form the available data).
Daily treatment at doses of 20 and 30 mg/ kg for one year in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in indicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/ g liver (biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 and -926 µg/ l on average, respectively.
For patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE that is numerically half that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered (e. g. a patient receiving 40 mg/ kg/ day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be transferred to a starting daily dose of 20 mg/ kg/ day of EXJADE).

The following side effects have also been reported: asthenia (weakness), nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, peripheral oedema (fluid retention), headaches, hypotension (low blood pressure), dizziness, myasthenia (muscle weakness), confusion and sweating.
QUADRAMET is contra-indicated: • Hypersensitivity to the active substance (ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate (EDTMP) or similar phosphonates) or to any of the excipients. • in pregnant women (See section 4.6). • in patients having received chemotherapy or hemi-body external radiation therapy in a preceding period of 6 weeks.
QUADRAMET has an affinity for skeletal tissue and concentrates in areas of bone turnover in intimate association with hydroxyapatite; studies in rats have demonstrated that QUADRAMET is cleared rapidly from the blood and localises to growing areas of bone matrix, specifically the layer of osteoid undergoing mineralisation.

For an administered activity of 2 590 MBq, the typical radiation dose to the target organ, skeletal metastases, is 86.5 Gy and the typical radiation doses to the critical organs are: normal bone surfaces 17.5 Gy, red marrow 4.0 Gy, urinary bladder wall 2.5 Gy, kidneys 0.047 Gy and ovaries 0.021 Gy.
Ratiograstim is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.
In patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 x 109/ l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of Ratiograstim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events.
The recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is 0.5 MIU (5 μ g)/ kg/ day given daily by subcutaneous injection from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range.
For reversal of neutropenia The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MIU (1 μ g)/ kg/ day given daily by subcutaneous injection with titration up to a maximum of 0.4 MIU (4 μ g)/ kg/ day until a normal neutrophil count is reached and can be maintained (ANC > 2.0 x109/ l).
Risks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy Special caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy because improved tumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may lead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic and dermatologic effects (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the specific chemotherapy agents used).
Undesirable effects reported with equal frequency in patients treated with filgrastim/ chemotherapy and placebo/ chemotherapy included nausea and vomiting, alopecia, diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia, mucositis, headache, cough, skin rash, chest pain, generalised weakness, sore throat, constipation and unspecified pain.
10 Reversible, dose-dependent and usually mild or moderate elevations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, serum uric acid and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) occurred with filgrastim in approximately 50%, 35%, 25%, and 10% of patients respectively, at recommended doses.

Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
Ratiograstim is used to stimulate the production of white blood cells in the following situations: • to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia (neutropenia with fever) in patients receiving chemotherapy (cancer treatment) that is cytotoxic (cell-killing); • to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing treatment to destroy the bone marrow cells before a bone marrow transplant (such as in some patients with leukaemia) if they are at a risk of long-term, severe neutropenia; • to increase levels of neutrophils and reduce the risk of infections in patients with neutropenia who have a history of severe, repeated infections; • to treat persistent neutropenia in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other treatments are not appropriate.
In the patients with HIV that was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, patients taking Agenerase with ritonavir had a greater fall in viral load after four weeks than those continuing to take their previous protease inhibitors: half of those taking Agenerase with ritonavir had viral loads below 400 copies/ ml, compared with none of those continuing to take their previous protease inhibitors.
Agenerase boosted with ritonavir must not be taken by patients who have severe problems with their liver, or by patients taking rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as ritonavir, such as flecainide and propafenone (used to correct irregular heartbeat).
Co-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicinal products and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening adverse events such as cardiac arrhythmia (e. g. amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide), respiratory depression and / or prolonged sedation (e. g. oral triazolam and oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5)) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia and ischaemia of other tissues, including cerebral or myocardial ischaemia (e. g. ergot derivatives).
Concomitant use of Agenerase with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism, thus concomitant use of Agenerase with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.
For some medicinal products that can cause serious or life-threatening undesirable effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (monitor International Normalised Ratio), concentration monitoring is available; this should minimise the risk of potential safety problems with concomitant use.
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Co-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these active substances thus increasing their plasma level and leading to serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions such as cardiac arrhythmia (e. g. amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, terfenadine) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia (e. g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine).
Ritonavir: the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the Cmax decreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was co-administered with amprenavir capsule (600 mg twice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of amprenavir capsules.
Lopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra): in an open-label, non-fasting pharmacokinetic study, the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of lopinavir were decreased by 38%, 28% and 52% respectively when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).
The amprenavir plasma Cmin values achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40- 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.
Co- administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and ketoconazole 200 mg once daily increased plasma ketoconazole Cmax by 25% and increased AUC(0-τ) to values 2.69-fold those observed on administration of ketoconazole 200 mg once daily without concurrent fosamprenavir with ritonavir.
Calcium-channel blockers: amprenavir may lead to increased serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil, possibly resulting in enhanced activity and toxicity of these medicinal products.
9 Fluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e. g. budesonide.
Methadone and opiate derivatives: co-administration of methadone with amprenavir resulted in a decrease in the Cmax and AUC of the active methadone enantiomer (R-enantiomer) of 25% and 13% respectively, whilst the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the inactive methadone enantiomer (S-enantiomer) were decreased by 48%, 40% and 23% respectively.
In PI experienced patients receiving Agenerase capsules 600 mg twice daily and low dose ritonavir, 100 mg twice daily, the nature and frequency of adverse events (grade 2-4) and Grade 3/ 4 laboratory abnormalities were similar to those observed with Agenerase alone, with the exception of elevated triglyceride levels, and elevated CPK levels which were very common in patients receiving Agenerase and low dose ritonavir.

Based on data from twenty-five antiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen (one of whom showed Baseline resistance to lopinavir and saquinavir and another to tipranavir) the resistance pathways associated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to atazanavir/ ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), darunavir/ ritonavir (four of 25 isolates), indinavir/ ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), lopinavir/ ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir/ ritonavir (four of 24 isolates)..
The evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on study PRO30017, a randomized, open-label study, in which PI-experienced adults experiencing virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ ml) received either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) in combination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) PI, predominantly boosted with low-dose RTV.

At therapeutic dosages (1200 mg twice daily), the mean maximum steady state concentration (Cmax, ss) of amprenavir capsules is 5.36 µg/ ml (0.92-9.81) and the minimum steady state concentration (Cmin, ss) is 0.28 µg/ ml (0.12-0.51).

Patients of 4 years and older unable to swallow Agenerase capsules: the recommended dose of Agenerase oral solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml)/ kg three times a day, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, without exceeding a total daily dose of 2800 mg (see section 5.1).
Agenerase oral solution is also contraindicated in patients treated with disulfiram or other medicinal products that reduce alcohol metabolism (e. g. metronidazole) and preparations that contain alcohol (e. g. ritonavir oral solution) or additional propylene glycol (see section 4.4and 5.1).
Co-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicinal products and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening adverse events such as cardiac arrhythmia (e. g. amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide), respiratory depression and / or prolonged sedation (e. g. oral triazolam and oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administred midazolam, see section 4.5)) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia and ischaemia of other tissues, including cerebral or myocardial ischaemia (e. g. ergot derivatives).
42 Patients taking the oral solution of Agenerase, particularly those with renal impairment or those with decreased ability to metabolise propylene glycol (e. g. those of Asian origin), should be monitored for adverse reactions potentially related to the high propylene glycol content (550 mg/ ml), such as seizures, stupor, tachycardia, hyperosmolarity, lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, haemolysis.
The concomitant administration of Agenerase oral solution with disulfiram or other medicinal products that reduce alcohol metabolism (e. g. metronidazole), or preparations that contain alcohol (e. g. ritonavir oral solution) or additional propylene glycol is contraindicated (see sections 4.3and 4.5).
Concomitant use of Agenerase with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism, thus concomitant use of Agenerase with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.
For some medicinal products that can cause serious or life-threatening undesirable effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (monitor International Normalised Ratio), concentration monitoring is available; this should minimise the risk of potential safety problems with concomitant use.

The amprenavir plasma Cmin values achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40- 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.
Calcium-channel blockers: amprenavir may lead to increased serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil, possibly resulting in enhanced activity and toxicity of these medicinal products.

Based on data from twenty-five antiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen (one of whom showed Baseline resistance to lopinavir and saquinavir and another to tipranavir) the resistance pathways associated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to atazanavir/ ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), darunavir/ ritonavir (four of 25 isolates), indinavir/ ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), lopinavir/ ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir/ ritonavir (four of 24 isolates)..
The evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on study PRO30017, a randomized, open-label study, in which PI-experienced adults experiencing virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ ml) received either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) in combination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) PI, predominantly boosted with low-dose RTV.

Because of the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient propylene glycol, Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in infants and children below the age of 4 years, pregnant women, patients with hepatic impairment or failure, patients with renal failure, and patients treated with disulfiram or metronidazole or preparations that contain alcohol (e.g. ritonavir oral solution) or additional propylene glycol (see also Take special care with Agenerase).
For the same reason you must not take disulfiram or other medicines that reduce alcohol metabolism (e.g. metronidazole) or preparations that contain alcohol (e.g. ritonavir oral solution) or additional propylene glycol while you are taking Agenerase oral solution (see also Do not take Agenerase).

The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 5.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
Psychiatric and “ paradoxical” reactions Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusion, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character and other behavioural effects are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents.
Enhancement of the central sedation may occur in cases of concomitant use with antipsychotics (neuroleptics), hypnotics, anxiolytics/ sedatives, antidepressant agents, narcotic analgesics, anti-epileptic medicinal products, anaesthetics, and sedative antihistamines.
Cimetidine, a non-specific moderate inhibitor of several hepatic enzymes including both aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A4, produced an 85% increase in plasma concentrations of zaleplon because it inhibited both the primary (aldehyde oxidase) and secondary (CYP3A4) enzymes responsible for zaleplon’ s metabolism.
Frequencies are defined as Very common (≥ 1/ 10) Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10) Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) Very rare (< 1/ 10,000) not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)
Psychiatric and “ paradoxical” reactions Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusions, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character, and other adverse behavioural reactions are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents.
Consequently, the oral clearance of zaleplon was reduced by 70% and 87% in compensated and decompensated cirrhotic patients, respectively, leading to marked increases in mean Cmax and AUC (up to 4-fold and 7-fold in compensated and decompensated patients, respectively) relative to healthy subjects.
Repeated oral administration of zaleplon to rats and dogs elicited increases in liver and adrenal weights; however, these increases occurred at high multiples of the maximum therapeutic dose, were reversible, were not associated with degenerative microscopic changes in liver or adrenal glands, and were consistent with effects in animals with other compounds that bind to benzodiazepine receptors.

Parkinson’ s disease, most common adverse events The most commonly (≥ 5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with Parkinson’ s disease more frequent with MIRAPEXIN treatment than with Placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue.
Appearance flat, round, 6 mm diameter, no score flat, oval, 7.86 x 5.63 mm, scores on both sides flat, oval, 10.59 x 7.59 mm, scores on both sides flat, round, 9 mm diameter, scores on both sides flat, round, 11 mm diameter, scores on both sides
MIRAPEXIN is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’ s disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i. e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “ on off” fluctuations).
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/ min, the initial daily dose of MIRAPEXIN should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/ 0.25 mg of salt daily).
Patients being treated with MIRAPEXIN and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8).

The MAH commits to performing the studies detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 2 of the Risk Management Plan presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).
Mirapexin can be used either on its own or in combination with levodopa (another medicine for Parkinson’ s disease), at any stage of disease including the later stages when levodopa starts becoming less effective; • moderate to severe restless legs syndrome, a disorder where the patient has uncontrollable urges to move the limbs to stop uncomfortable, painful or odd sensations in the body, usually at night.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Mirapexin’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’ s disease alone or in combination with levodopa, and for the treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome in dosages up to 0.54 mg of base.
The most common side effects with Valdoxan (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, dizziness, somnolence (sleepiness), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), migraine, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, constipation, upper abdominal pain (tummy ache), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), back pain, fatigue (tiredness), increases in liver enzymes and anxiety.
While there was no specific safety signal in the 800 patients treated in combination with oestrogens, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine with other moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e. g. propranolol, grepafloxacine, enoxacine) until more experience has been gained (see section 4.4).
Adverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
In a specific study involving cirrhotic patients with chronic mild (Child-Pugh type A) or moderate (Child-Pugh type B) liver impairment, exposure to agomelatine 25 mg was substantially increased (70- times and 140-times, respectively), compared to matched volunteers (age, weight and smoking habit) with no liver failure (see section 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).
The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in the version 4.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in the module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • when new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • at the request of the EMEA

The major concern of the CHMP was that the effectiveness of Valdoxan/ Thymanax had not been sufficiently shown: • The long-term study did not show that the medicine was effective. • The short-term studies showed that the medicine has an effect, but the extent of this did not allow the Committee to draw a firm conclusion on the medicine ’ s effectiveness The CHMP had no special concerns regarding the side effects associated with Valdoxan/ Thymanax, as these could have been managed using the standard risk management tools.
In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
Alopecia, altered bowel habits, dyspepsia, dyspnoea, rhinitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia, gynaecomastia, hyperglycaemia, impotence, increased urinary frequency, leucopenia, malaise, mood changes, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, angioedema and erythema multiforme.
Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
9 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Dafiro regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7 – 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
11 In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.

High tumour burden is defined as having at least one of the following: bulky tumour mass (> 7 cm), involvement of three or more nodal sites (each > 3 cm), systemic symptoms (weight loss > 10%, fever > 38°C for more than 8 days, or nocturnal sweats), splenomegaly beyond the umbilicus, major organ obstruction or compression syndrome, orbital or epidural involvement, serous effusion, or leukaemia.
As induction therapy, interferon alfa-2b is administered intravenously at a dose of 20 million IU/ m2 daily for five days a week for a four-week period; the calculated interferon alfa-2b dose is added to sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection and administered as a 20- minute infusion (see section 6.6).
Administration of IntronA in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents (e. g., Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide) may lead to increased risk of toxicity (severity and duration), which may be life-threatening or fatal as a result of the concomitantly administered medicinal product.
